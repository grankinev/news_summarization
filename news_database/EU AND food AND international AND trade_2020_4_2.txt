Trump warned US citizens that the next couple of weeks are going to be \"horrific,\" as the country grapples with the outbreak amid predictions of up to 200,000 deaths.\n\nAbout ventilators, the US will soon have an excess, which it will be distributing to other countries, the president said during his daily briefing.

Von Notz emphasized that the app would only save the contact data of others who have the app.\n\n\"That, if done correctly in a detailed way, is a data-efficient solution and an effective way of finding out who might have been potentially infected,\" von Notz said.\n\nHe warned, however, that the app would not be able to — and shouldn't be able to — let people know whether the person standing next to them in line at the grocery store is infected.\n\nRead more: Will Germans trade privacy for coronavirus protection?\n\nFollowing a phone conference with state leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also spoke in favor of tracking apps.\n\n\"It's clear that it would be on a voluntary basis, but if the testing of these apps shows them to be good and set to be successful in better tracing cases of where there has been contact, I'd certainly be in favor of recommending that to citizens,\" she said.\n\n\"I would of course also be prepared to use it myself to perhaps help other people,\" she added.\n\n1540 In Israel, the defense minister on Wednesday appeared to tie potential coronavirus aid for the Gaza Strip to an attempt to get back the remains of two Israeli soldiers who died in 2014.\n\nGaza, which currently has 12 reported cases of coronavirus, has just 96 ventilators for its population of 2 million. The impoverished Palestinian territory does not have the infrastructure to contain an outbreak.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett told reporters that it would \"not be right\" to disconnect aid for Gaza from Israel recovering the soldiers' remains.\n\n\"The moment there is talk of the humanitarian world in Gaza. Israel also has humanitarian needs, which are mainly the recovery of the fallen,\" Bennett of the soldiers whose remains are being held by Hamas, Gaza's Islamist governing authority.\n\nIt was unclear whether Bennett was referring to the possibility of Israel providing aid directly, or of the country allowing the transfer of aid over its borders.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum rejected the idea. \"Israel bears responsibility for any consequences should the disease spread in Gaza because it has been blockading it for 13 years,\" he said. \"A prisoner swap deal is a separate track.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli authorities are also considering a full lockdown for the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak, a crowded ultra-Orthodox suburb with around 730 known cases of coronavirus.\n\nThe suburb of 200,000 has the second-highest number of infections in the country after Jerusalem.

The shops are closed. Even a healthy company like Adidas cannot stand this for long,\" Adidas said in an open letter sent to several media outlets.\n\nThe German sportswear giant said it understood criticism levied against it from customers and politicians alike.\n\n\"We would, therefore, like to apologize to you formally. We have paid our landlords the rent for April,\" Adidas said.\n\n13:13 In France, the death toll rose to over 4,000 with many of those who died coming from the eastern region of Grand Est, along the border with Germany.

She said only that it would be guaranteed by all EU countries.\n\n\"Companies are paying salaries to their employees, even if, right now, they are not making money. Europe is now coming to their support, with a new initiative,\" she said. \"It is intended to help Italy, Spain and all other countries that have been hard hit. And it will do so thanks to the solidarity of other member states.\"\n\nIn Germany's long-standing short-work, or Kurzarbeit, scheme, a part of a worker's wages is covered by the government if companies cut their work hours during a slowdown to prevent them from entirely cutting jobs.\n\nShort-time work: A vital tool in Germany's economic armory against coronavirus\n\n12:25 In Germany, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz announced the country is setting aside €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in aid to help start-ups survive the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Federal Association of German Start-ups, nine out of 10 new emerging companies are feeling the effects of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nEconomy Minister Peter Altmaier said Germany's start-up scene has made significant progress in recent years that it should not give up.\n\nRead more: Start-ups get a coronavirus boost\n\nThe German government is also working to set up a €10 billion start-up fund.\n\n11:57 Indonesia has said the national death toll from COVID-19 had reached 157, compared with 58 a week ago.

Tests only confirmed this week that the child also had COVID-19.\n\n11:55 The Philippines has recorded 227 new coronavirus cases and eight more deaths, the country's Health Ministry said, bringing the total number of infections and deaths to 2,311 and 96, respectively.\n\nResidents of a slum area in the capital Manila staged a protest, demanding basic emergency relief goods such as food amid a month-long lockdown that has left many of them without work.

He said the Japanese government would do \"whatever is needed.\"\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has shied away from declaring a state of emergency. Even if it were declared, he said, it would not mean he could order an immediate nationwide lockdown of cities, such as in France. Any emergency declaration would allow prefectural governors to make necessary requests and give orders, he said.\n\nAbe said that even if Japan could avoid an explosive spread of the coronavirus, the country was expected to \"remain on the brink for a long time.\"\n\nJapan has some 2,229 COVID-19 cases and 57 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University — far lower than numbers from the United States, Europe and China.

It has already barred individuals from entering the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nUp to 2 million Muslims perform the yearly pilgrimage, one of the central pillars of Islam. Canceling the hajj would be unprecedented in modern times, but limiting attendance from high-risk areas has happened before, such as during the Ebola outbreak.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Millions of Muslim Pilgrims The hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the most holy city for Muslims. All Muslims are expected to perform this religious duty at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially able. It is one of the five pillars of Islam, or core ritual practices, and considered to be the largest gathering of people in the world, with millions attending every year.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Following the prophet As many as three million pilgrims perform a series of rituals over the course of five or six days. First, they stop to pray at the Grand Mosque, home to a cubic building draped in black silk called the Kaaba, Islam’s most important shrine.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Stoning the devil Pilgrims travel to the village of Mina to again pray and read from the Quran. Next they spend a day at Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed gave his final sermon, to ask for forgiveness. On their return journey to Mecca, the pilgrims stop on a plain called Muzdalifah to collect stones, which they will throw at three pillars in Mina to symbolically stone the devil.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Circling Kaaba Finally, upon returning to Mecca, the pilgrims will circle the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque seven times, bringing their hajj to a close. They then shave their heads and perform an animal sacrifice before celebrating the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Tragedy during hajj Since 1987, more than 5,800 people have died in building collapses, stampedes, trampling and fires. In 2015, a stampede resulted in around 2,400 deaths, making it the worst catastrophe in the history of hajj. The pilgrimage is also a hotbed of infectious disease, as pilgrims from every corner of the planet often trek around in the heat barefoot and share tight sleeping quarters.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Bringing the new to the old While the hajj is the oldest and most sacred ritual of Islam, it has also been brought into the 21st Century. The Saudi government is using the latest in crowd-control techniques to prevent trampling and architectural collapses. On YouTube, they telecast live hajj and now, Google, iTunes and other sites have come out with hajj apps to help pilgrims better understand and perform the hajj rituals.\n\n\n\n06:45 Taiwan has said it will donate 10 million masks to the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe island, which is the world's second-largest mask producer, will send 7 million masks to 11 European countries including Italy, Spain and Germany.\n\nThe United States will receive 2 million masks, Germany's DPA news agency reported, with a further 1 million masks to be sent to the 15 countries with which Taiwan has diplomatic relations.\n\nTaiwan soon expects to be able to make 15 million surgical masks a day.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center said there had been 322 total cases of COVID-19 on the island, including five deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, President Tsai Ing-wen announced a financial stimulus valuing some $35 billion (€31 billion) to cushion the impact of the coronavirus on the Taiwanese economy.\n\nRead more: How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?\n\nWatch video 03:10 Is the virus under control in China and Taiwan? – DW's Phoebe Kong reports\n\n06:23 China's National Health Commission says it has recorded 36 new cases of the COVID-19 disease in one day, after announcing that asymptomatic cases would be included in the official count from now on. It did not say if any of the new cases was asymptomatic.\n\nThe commission said all but one of the new cases was imported from abroad. It also added that there had been seven more deaths from the disease in the past 24 hours.\n\nChina’s National Health Commission has reported 1,367 asymptomatic cases under observation as of Tuesday. The country announced earlier on Wednesday that is was extending screening to asymptomatic cases and the people with whom they have been in contact.\n\nThe data comes amid scrutiny of figures reported by the Chinese authorities, which previously only included those people who exhibited symptoms. The proportion of people who have contracted the virus but remain asymptomatic is currently unknown, but experts have estimated it could be as high as 30%. According to scientists, these carriers can still pass COVID-19 onto others who do become sick.\n\nWhile China's domestic outbreak has largely subsided, questions have arisen over whether the country's failure to count asymptomatic cases would lead to a resurgence of infections.\n\nChina, where the novel coronavirus was first detected in December, has recorded a total of 81,554 cases of COVID-19 and 3,312 deaths from the disease.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: China's Wuhan prepares for the uncertain end of COVID-19\n\n05:47 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the coronavirus pandemic amounted to humanity's worst crisis since World War II, with the outbreak threatening people in every country.\n\nGuterres said the disease and measures taken against it would likely bring about a recession \"that probably has no parallel in the recent past.\"\n\nThe effect of both the disease and its economic impact will contribute to \"enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict,\" the UN chief said at the launch on Tuesday of a report into the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19.\n\n\"We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the United Nations — one that is killing people, spreading human suffering, and upending people's lives,\" the report said.\n\n\"This is much more than a health crisis. It is a human crisis. The coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core.\"\n\nEarlier, Guterres announced a new trust fund that would help some countries respond to the emergency and recover from its effects at a social and economic level.\n\n05:40 German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to meet state premiers from across Germany on Wednesday to discuss the effect that anti-coronavirus measures are having.\n\nGermany introduced strict contact restrictions about 10 days ago, banning meetings between more than two people not from the same household outside of the workplace.\n\nIt is expected that the latest discussions will include a debate over an obligation to wear masks in public places. Austria announced such a measure on Monday, triggering discussions in Germany. Some municipalities in the eastern state of Thuringia have already issued decrees for masks to be mandatory in supermarkets, buses and trains.\n\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn on Tuesday said he was against making it obligatory for protective masks to be worn.\n\nWatch video 01:53 Share Are face masks effective?

This makes it the country with the fifth-highest level of infection in the world, although this has been partly attributed to the widespread testing being carried out in the country. The university data also shows a total of 775 deaths as a result of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), put the death toll in the country at 732 as of early Wednesday and the total number of infection cases at 67,366. The RKI sometimes has a slight time lag in updating its data because it collates figures submitted by regional and local authorities.\n\nThe agency's data showed infections had increased by 5,453 compared with the previous day, while the death toll had experienced a sharp rise of 149.\n\n04:29 The death toll in the US from the novel coronavirus pandemic has reached 4,076 — double the number from three days prior, the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland reported. The total number of infections has reached 189,510 nationwide, according to the same statistics. Experts have predicted that up to 240,000 individuals in the US could die as a result of the outbreak.\n\n03:51 In sharp change from his usual tone on the coronavirus pandemic, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro acknowledged the danger posed by the outbreak. \"The virus is a reality,\" he said in a televised speech on Tuesday. \"We are standing in front of one of the greatest challenges of our generation.\"\n\nPreviously, Bolsonaro dismissed the virus as a \"little flu,\" criticized lockdowns imposed by local authorities, and flaunted social distancing recommendations from his own government by meeting groups of his supporters. He also repeatedly urged Brazilians to return to work.\n\nIn the Tuesday speech, Bolsonaro once again voiced his concerns over the economy and warned that the cure against the outbreak cannot be worse than the pandemic itself.\n\n03:33 Taiwan's government will provide an economic stimulus of over $1 trillion, (€907 billion) to mitigate coronavirus fallout, said President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday.\n\nRead more: How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?\n\n03:27 German police believe anti-pandemic isolation measures are causing a rise in domestic violence. The rise is already noticeable according to the data provided by victims' shelters and emergency phone operators, said senior police representative Harald Schmidt.\n\nSpeaking to Passauer Neue Presse daily, Schmidt said that similar spikes regularly happen during Christmas holidays when families \"spend more time with each other.\" However, the current crisis is also boosting financial fears and other stress factors often linked with abuse, said Schmidt.\n\n03:17 California will release some 3,500 non-violent inmates from prison as part of its efforts to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, state officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe first group will consist of inmates with less than 30 days to serve, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). They would be followed by prisoners with less than 60 days remaining of their term.\n\n\"We do not take these new measures lightly,\" CDCR Secretary Ralph Diaz said in a statement. \"However, in the face of a global pandemic, we must consider the risk of COVID-19 infection as a grave threat to safety, too.\"\n\n03:14 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier joined several heads of state to urge a \"new global alliance\" against the coronavirus in a letter published by the Financial Times on Wednesday.\n\n\"This pandemic will not spare any country, no matter how advanced its economy, capabilities, or technology,\" the leaders said in a letter also signed by Singapore's President Halimah Yacob, Ethiopia's Sahle-Work Zewde, Ecuador's Lenin Moreno, as well as Jordan's King Abdullah II.\n\n\"This is a global crisis,\" the letter states. \"Delay in action means death.\" Among other measures, the heads of state called for boosting research into treatments and vaccines, and \"fair and equitable\" distribution of medical equipment ant testing kits. \"A global solution is in everybody's self-interest,\" they said.\n\n03:00 Germany's Bayreuth Festival, the annual opera event honoring composer Richard Wagner, has been canceled due to the coronavirus.\n\nThe popular music festival had been set to start in late July and last until late August. The event was to feature a premiere of a new production of Wagner's epic four-part Ring Cycle.\n\n\"We are of course sad, especially because we were looking forward to an exciting new production of the 'Ring,'\" said the festival chief and composer's great-granddaughter Katharina Wagner. \"But health comes first,\" she told Germany's DPA news agency.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled All quiet on the Wagnerian front An older audience packed in close quarters in a sweltering theater: for virus transmission, a horrific scenario. The Bayreuth Festival 2020 has been called off, for the first time in its 144-year history due to an epidemic. Rehearsals for the new production of the opera cycle \"The Ring of the Nibelung\" were to begin on April 1 - but now, the \"Ring\" can only premiere in 2022 at the earliest.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Berlin's major events A day after Berlin announced that performances in major state-owned venues were to be cancelled until April 19, city authorities have banned all events with more than 1,000 participants as well. \"The coronavirus continues to spread. In such a phase, public life must be restricted,\" Berlin's local Health Minister Dilek Kalayci said.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Madonna and other concerts Many major concerts have been cancelled, including Madonna's last two dates of her \"Madame X\" tour in Paris. France has banned on Sunday public gatherings of more than 1,000 people. The Paris Opera has also cancelled its performances.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled St. Patrick's Day in Ireland All Irish St. Patrick's Day parades, including Dublin's main celebration that draws around 500,000 revelers from all over the world each year, are cancelled because of fears over the spread of COVID-19, state broadcaster RTE reported on Monday. Ireland's famous March 17 parades were also previously cancelled in 2001 during an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Vatican museums With quarantine measures in place in northern Italy, soccer matches occurring without spectators, and Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte's order to close museums, theaters and cinemas, it should come as no surprise that the Vatican has closed the doors to its museums, including the Sistine Chapel (above), until probably April 3. In the Vatican itself, five people are currently in quarantine.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled South by Southwest (SXSW) This annual music, film and tech festival held in Austin, Texas, usually attracts more than 400,000 visitors. But less than a week before its March 12, 2020 start date, organizers decided to cancel in a bid to prevent the spreading of the coronavirus. There's a silver lining though: it may only be postponed and not cancelled altogether.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Bollywood 'Oscars' The International Film Academy has announced that it would be postponing its awards ceremony, also known as Bollywood's Oscars, due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak. According to official numbers, India has been until now relatively unscathed by the epidemic. Actor Shah Rukh Khan (photo) was one the stars expected at the event planned for March 27; a new date has not been decided yet.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled 'No Time to Die' James Bond perhaps has a little more time on his hands than the title of the upcoming film in the franchise suggests: \"No Time to Die\" producers have decided to push back the release of the movie to November. Daniel Craig's last outing as 007 was initially planned for April. It's the first Hollywood blockbuster to shift its release schedule in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Venice Architecture Biennale The start of the world's most prestigious architecture biennale has also been delayed. Instead of opening in May, it will run from August 29 to November 29 — three months later than planned. The theme of the event takes on a new meaning amid current developments: \"How do we live together?\"\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled London Book Fair Due to take place March 10-12, the book fair was cancelled \"with reluctance,\" said organizers, after several major publishers such as HarperCollins and Penguin Random House pulled out of the event to avoid exposing their staff to the virus. The London Book Fair usually draws more than 25,000 authors and book industry insiders.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Musikmesse Frankfurt Europe's biggest trade fair for the music industry also announced that it was postponing the event, which was set to celebrate its 40th anniversary on April 2-4. While it was deemed to be \"the only responsible and right decision to take,\" the cancellation is bound to affect many small businesses in the music industry, said Christian Höppner, secretary general of the German Music Council.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Leipzig Book Fair Change of plans for book fans: The Leipzig Book Fair, scheduled to be held March 12-15, was cancelled due to the spread of the new coronavirus, a spokesperson for the fair announced on March 3. The second-largest book fair in Germany expected to draw 2,500 exhibitors from 51 countries.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled ITB Travel Trade Show Berlin Preparations for the world's largest travel fair were already in full swing when the organizers cancelled it at the last minute. Due to the ongoing virus threat, participants to the Berlin fair had to prove they had not been to one of the defined risk areas. With 170,000 visitors from all over the world, this proved to be an impossible task and the fair couldn't open on March 4 as planned.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Milan Design Week Each April, thousands of design professionals, artists and companies visit Milan to check out the latest in furniture and interior design. This year, however, organizers have announced it will be moved to June due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Milan is the capital of the Lombardy region, which has seen the lion's share of Italian coronivirus cases. Some airlines have even suspended their flights.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled La Scala opera house There is perhaps no venue more symbolic of Italy's rich operatic tradition than the La Scala opera house in Milan. Now, its seats will remain empty until March 8. Italy's Prime Minister called for the suspension of cultural events and the venue is sticking to the rules. At the time of writing, Italy has more cases of the new coronavirus than any country outside of Asia.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled K-Pop concerts The reigning K-Pop boy band BTS does big business with each concert, but in the wake of the virus in South Korea, the group cancelled four April dates at the Seoul Olympic Stadium, which seats 69,950 people. \"It's impossible to predict the scale of the outbreak,\" said the group's management. On Tuesday, cases in South Korea reached 5,100 with the majority of infections in the city of Daegu.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled 'Mission Impossible' No, we aren't describing the task of containing the new coronavirus, but rather the new movie starring Tom Cruise which was supposed to have a three-week shoot in Venice. The film has been postponed, movie studio Paramount Pictures said Monday. Venice's cultural events have been hard hit by the outbreak. The final two days of lagoon city's annual Carnival festival were also cancelled.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Concerts in Switzerland On February 28, the Swiss government imposed a ban on events of more than 1,000 people until March 15, making it the first European country to do so as a preemptive measure to fight against the spread of the illness. As a result, many concerts and events were called off, including concerts by Carlos Santana (pictured) and Alice Cooper at the 15,000-person Hellenstadion in Zürich.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled The Hamburg Ballet The Hamburg Ballet John Neumeier cancelled guest performances in Macau and Singapore due to the coronavirus outbreak. On the program were \"The Lady of the Camellias,\" which tells the story of a famous Parisian courtesan and \"Nijinsky.\" Whether the tour will take place at another point in time is still in the air. In spring 2021 the Hamburg Ballet plans to tour in Japan.

Out of the 3,500 civilian servicemen, 2,000 are volunteers who previously completed their mandatory stints, and 1,500 are active servicemen who decided to stay in the system for longer due to the pandemic.\n\nThe men would mostly focus on supporting caregivers with transport, organization and logistics, said Agriculture, Regions and Tourism Minister Elisabeth Köstinger.\n\n\"Currently, this is peace before the storm,\" said Köstinger, whose ministry is also in charge of the civilian service. \"Our care-providing system will very quickly be put under extreme strain, so we need all the support we can get.\"\n\n02:11 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and premiers of Germany's 16 states are set to hold a telephone conference on Wednesday to discuss the battle against the ongoing pandemic. The leaders would discuss prolonging lockdown measures introduced on Monday last week. Another issue on the agenda should be the possibility of using a tracking app to monitor people infected with the coronavirus. Additionally, the politicians will consider further expanding intensive care capacity in German hospitals.\n\nWatch video 01:50 German coronavirus measures to remain until April 20\n\n01:57 With NBA games canceled due to the pandemic, NBA players will now play video games against each other for charity, the basketball league said.\n\nThe televised tournament will feature 16 athletes from different teams playing NBA 2K — a video game which features likenesses and names of real-life NBA teams and players — starting this Friday. The final match is scheduled for Saturday next week.\n\nThe winner is set to receive $100,000 (€90,771) to donate to a charity of his choice supporting COVID-19 relief.\n\n01:15 Amazon faced heavy criticism after firing a worker who staged a strike, asking for the company to provide better protection from the coronavirus. The retail giant claims the employee, previously working in a warehouse on New York's Staten Island, was fired because he violated quarantine rules and endangered his colleagues.\n\nOn Tuesday, New York's Attorney General slammed the sacking as \"immoral and inhumane.\"\n\n\"It is disgraceful that Amazon would terminate an employee who bravely stood up to protect himself and his colleagues,\" she said in a statement, adding that her office was \"considering all legal options.\" Separately, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he had ordered the city's human rights officer to look into the incident.\n\n01:02 In the United States, 865 people died of the coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, a record day-to-day increase based on the tally provided by the Johns Hopkins University.

Crozier asked for over 4,000 people on board to be removed and isolated, warning that most of the current accommodation on board was not suitable for quarantine.\n\nKeeping them on board \"is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those sailors entrusted to our care,\" he wrote. US officials cited by the Reuters news agency said that nearly 80 people aboard the nuclear-powered warship had tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he had not read the letter in detail, but added it was not the time to evacuate the ship. \"I don't think we're at that point,\" he told CNN.\n\n00:30 US President Donald Trump hinted at expanding travel restrictions on Tuesday, saying that he was \"absolutely\" considering a ban on Brazil and several other countries.\n\nIn February and March, the US administration introduced bans on travelers from China and virtually all western European countries in a bid to curb the spread COVID-19.

            "content": "African finance ministers want the European Union, International Monetary Fund and World Bank to support a multi-billion debt relief programme for the continent amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.\n\n“The call for debt relief … should be for all of Africa and should be undertaken in a coordinated and collaborative way,” the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) said in a statement following a videoconference of African finance ministers on Tuesday (31 March).\n\nIt added that “development partners should consider debt relief and forbearance of interest payments over a two- to three-year period for all African countries”.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic may not, yet, have wreaked the same havoc as in Europe and North America – confirmed cases stood at over 5,300 by 31 March, with more than 170 recorded deaths – but most African countries have imposed nationwide lockdown and curfews.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis, accompanied by plummeting oil and commodity prices, and the prospect of a global recession, is already hitting national treasuries.\n\n“There is a big likelihood of a recession,” Bartholomew Armah, head of macroeconomics and governance at UNECA, warned last week.\n\nUNECA has already revised down pan-African economic growth forecast from 3.2% in 2020 to 1.8%, an estimate which Armah now says is ‘conservative’, having been made when the number of coronavirus cases in Africa was low.\n\nIn a paper published earlier this month, UNECA warned that African oil exporters face losses of up to US$65 billion, with total fuel export revenues falling to $101 billion this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the continent’s dependence on imported medical and pharmaceutical products, and the fact that only 15 African countries are net food exporters, also poses the risk of inflation.\n\nUNECA estimates that an additional $10.6 billion in healthcare spending will be required across the 54 African nations.\n\nFinancing that extra spending and covering the costs of lost trade will require substantial assistance and new investment programmes from the international community, of which the EU is the biggest aid donor and trade partner.\n\nAfrican finance ministers last week called for an immediate emergency economic stimulus worth US$100 billion.\n\nThat would include the waiver of all interest payments, estimated at $44 billion for 2020, and the possible extension of the waiver, which ministers say would “provide immediate fiscal space and liquidity to the governments”.\n\nThe World Bank and the IMF have already given their endorsement for debt relief and said they will seek to get approval from governments at their Spring Meetings on 16-17 April.\n\nIn a joint statement on 25 March, the Bretton Woods institutions also called on the G20 to task them with “identifying the countries with unsustainable debt situations, and to prepare a proposal for comprehensive action by official bilateral creditors to address both the financing and debt relief needs of IDA (International Development Association) countries”.\n\nThe last continent to face up COVID-19, Africa ‘needs to wake up’ As Europe and North American countries go into self-imposed economic and social lockdown to curb the coronavirus pandemic, Africa remains the continent least affected by the virus. Still, a raft of African governments were quick to impose travel bans on airlines carrying passengers from Europe last week.\n\nAnalysts believe that more than 30 million jobs are at risk across the continent, particularly in the tourism and airline sectors.\n\nThe wish-list of African ministers includes refinancing schemes and guarantee facilities to waive, restructure and provide funding for businesses in those sectors, as well as debt and interest waivers for firms in the agriculture, imports and exports, pharmaceuticals and banking.\n\nThey also want a liquidity line so that businesses that are dependent on trade or provide essential goods can continue to function.\n\n$100 billion across 54 countries is small compared to the more than €1 trillion of national rescue packages across the EU, but the G20 meeting and European Council summit – both held by video conference on 26 March – concluded without any mention of an African stimulus programme.\n\nThe most obvious candidates to bankroll a new Africa-focused financing programme, along with the World Bank and IMF, include the European Central Bank, which has already announced a €750 billion bond-buying programme, albeit focused on the eurozone, and the European Investment Bank, which has responsibility for public and private sector investment vehicles in Africa.\n\nOf the two, insiders in Brussels say the Luxembourg-based EIB is more likely. The EIB’s leadership already have designs on creating a stand-alone entity focused on African investment.\n\nThe fear that revenue losses will lead to the accumulation of unsustainable debts is not a uniquely African concern.\n\nThe country worst hit by the coronavirus crisis, Italy, with a debt to GDP ratio of 135%, is among a group of eurozone countries demanding the introduction of jointly issued ‘coronabonds’, in a bid to avoid taking on major new debts alone.\n\nChina has also been touted as a possible source of financing by African states, though that could add to the existing geopolitical frictions, with the US blaming the disease on China, which is trying to win friends by offering aid to affected countries.\n\nThere are already signs of that in Africa, where Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been quick to tout its services, offering African governments a ‘temperature screening and monitoring system’ that can be put at airports and ports and at the entrance of buildings, as well as donations of masks, protective gloves and hand disinfectant.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]"

INSTEX is based in Paris.\n\nHowever, European companies have not used this mechanism for fear of US sanctions on them.\n\nThe three European countries have already contributed €5 million to Iran in order to fight with spread of coronavirus.

            "content": "Nuclear war was the great fear of the 20th century and our institutions were built to respond to such threats. But Covid-19 has shown the world’s defence experts that we were blind, writes Stephan Blank.\n\nStephen Blank is a former senior advisor to the CIA and Pentagon. He is a Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and formerly a Professor of National Security Studies at the US Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute.\n\nToday, the biggest threats are in fact cellular. And the 21st century’s biggest threats are not ones we can defend against using standing armies or sophisticated weapons.\n\nThat’s why COVID-19 is changing the world and its major defence institutions. But whether that change can take place at the speed and scale the world needs is questionable.\n\nThat’s because even before COVID-19, the rise of ‘anti-globalism’, propelled by the meteoric popularity of extreme-right politics, threatened to unravel the world’s post-war security architecture. And the divisive political and economic trends of that shift led to the rapid weakening of institutions, alliances and agreements created to avoid diplomatic disagreements from turning into full-blown conflicts. Thais is why we are today witnessing a disjointed global response to COVID-19.\n\nThis lack of coordination against a global pandemic is one of the biggest challenges the world faces today. After all, the 21st Century’s biggest threats are systemic: and to fend them off, we need to rethink the very nature of national security.\n\nClimate change, for instance, is now increasingly recognized by national security agencies as the pre-eminent security threat, precisely due to its capacity to act as a ‘threat amplifier’ that increases the risk of social disruption, conflict, food insecurity, economic crisis, and of course, disease outbreaks.\n\nAnd while the COVID-19 is bound to do significant damage – in terms of both loss of life and socio-economic disruption – scientists have warned for years that climate change will massively increase the risk of future pandemics, by amplifying disease vectors. The coronavirus is horrifying – but it’s probably a dry-run for worse future pandemics.\n\nTo prepare for this brave and frightening new world, we need a different approach. Ironically, for instance, the global pandemic erupted during an escalating cascade of trade wars engulfing the US, EU, China and Asia, greatly radicalised by nationalist priorities, all of which massively undermined global preparedness for the global climate security threat.\n\nWhile it’s entirely expected that sovereign nations must focus on their own interests, we can now see that there must be a bigger picture approach. The US-China trade dispute, for instance, had undermined critical climate action by endangering access to critical raw materials required for the clean energy transition, imported largely from China. The US and EU were exchanging draconian tariffs on each other for industrial production relating to cars, aircraft and beyond. These mutual tariffs were hurting both economies and undermining incentives within these industries to invest in sustainable innovation. At the same time, they encouraged each side to compete ferociously, risking environmentally dangerous practices.\n\nThe UK and EU Brexit break-up, which showed no signs of an affable resolution prior to the pandemic, had put at risk joint efforts to achieve the 2050 emissions-neutrality goal – which both parties had committed to. While the EU planned to speed ahead with a robust green policy framework, the UK as yet did not have anything remotely similar.\n\nSimilarly, the EU’s clean transport plan had depended on an incoherent biofuels policy which needlessly created the risk of a new trade war with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which include fastest growing economies in the world. The EU had simultaneously banned palm oil for biodiesel, labelling it unsustainable, while protecting its own dirty biofuel industries. The irony is that while scientists warn that banning palm oil would worsen deforestation (it uses far less land, fertilizer and pesticides than other oilseeds), they have also highlighted how domestic EU biofuels can still produce higher carbon emissions than petrol.\n\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic has temporarily alleviated attention to these tensions, the reality is that it was the myopic preoccupation with these issues that heightened our global vulnerability to a systemic crisis in the first place.\n\nAs nations have tried to tear chunks out of each other, they each weakened their national security capabilities. They did not plan meaningfully for climate change. They did not invest sufficiently in pandemic preparedness. They did not build sufficiently robust national security partnerships to foster resilience to complex problems.\n\nThat is why as the coronavirus pandemic escalates, the task of rethinking the political and economic fundamentals of a more coherent approach to national security remains increasingly urgent. National security, federal politics and economic priorities, need to adapt holistically to the new global landscape of complex security threats.\n\nPre-COVID19 preoccupations with narrowly conceived conventional issues like state adversaries, non-state terror, or economic competition, are not unimportant – but if pursued without nuance, undermine the sophisticated planning, coordination and rapid response tools we need for the 21st century.\n\nNo country can realize its national security imperatives without adopting a global mindset. National sovereignty requires a new form of preparedness on an international scale which has hitherto been neglected. That, in turn, requires strengthening institutions which support cross-sector strategic cooperation. The challenges of the 21st century are fraught and deeply complex. Thus, defending our national sovereignty requires us to work cooperatively with other nations, much like we did to mitigate the nuclear threat.\n\nThe alternative scenario – extreme nationalism and protectionist economics creating a second great humanitarian disaster, is simply not an option."

            "content": "This blog is part of a special series on the response to the coronavirus.\n\nBy Giovanni Dell’Ariccia, Paolo Mauro, Antonio Spilimbergo, and Jeromin Zettelmeyer\n\nعربي, Español, Français, 日本語, Русский\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis like no other. It feels like a war, and in many ways it is. People are dying. Medical professionals are on the front lines. Those in essential services, food distribution, delivery, and public utilities work overtime to support the effort. And then there are the hidden soldiers: those who fight the epidemic confined in their homes, unable to fully contribute to production.\n\nIn a war, massive spending on armaments stimulates economic activity and special provisions ensure essential services. In this crisis, things are more complicated, but a common feature is an increased role for the public sector.\n\nThe success of the pace of recovery will depend crucially on policies undertaken during the crisis.\n\nAt the risk of oversimplifying, policy needs to distinguish two phases:\n\nPhase 1: the war. The epidemic is in full swing. To save people’s lives, mitigation measures are severely curtailing economic activity. This may be expected to last at least one or two quarters.\n\nPhase 2: the post-war recovery. The epidemic will be under control with vaccines/drugs, partial herd immunity, and continued but less disruptive containment measures. As restrictions are lifted, the economy returns—perhaps haltingly—to normal functioning.\n\nThe success of the pace of recovery will depend crucially on policies undertaken during the crisis. If policies ensure that workers do not lose their jobs, renters and homeowners are not evicted, companies avoid bankruptcy, and business and trade networks are preserved, the recovery will occur sooner and more smoothly.\n\nThis is a major challenge for advanced economies whose governments can easily finance an extraordinary increase in expenditures even as their revenues are dropping. The challenge is even greater for low-income and emerging economies that face capital flight; they will require grants and financing from the global community (a focus for a subsequent blog).\n\nWartime policy measures\n\nUnlike other economic downturns, the fall of output in this crisis is not driven by demand: it is an unavoidable consequence of measures to limit the spread of the disease. The role of economic policy is hence not to stimulate aggregate demand, at least not right away. Rather, policy has three objectives:\n\nGuarantee the functioning of essential sectors. Resources for COVID-19 testing and treatment must be boosted. Regular health care, food production and distribution, essential infrastructure, and utilities must be maintained. It may even involve intrusive actions by the government to provide key supplies through recourse to wartime powers with prioritization of public contracts for critical inputs and final goods, conversion of industries, or selective nationalizations. France’s early seizing of medical masks and the activation of the Defense Production Act in the United States to ensure the production of medical equipment illustrate this. Rationing, price controls, and rules against hoarding may also be warranted in situations of extreme shortages.\n\nProvide enough resources for people hit by the crisis. Households who lose their income directly or indirectly because of containment measures will need government support. Support should help people stay at home while keeping their jobs (government-funded sick leave reduces movement of people, hence the risk of contagion). Unemployment benefits should be expanded and extended. Cash transfers are needed to reach the self-employed and those without jobs.\n\nPrevent excessive economic disruption. Policies need to safeguard the web of relations among workers and employers, producers and consumers, lenders and borrowers, so that business can resume in earnest when the medical emergency abates. Company closures would cause loss of organizational know-how and termination of productive long-term projects. Disruptions in the financial sector would also amplify economic distress. Governments need to provide exceptional support to private firms, including wage subsidies, with appropriate conditions. Large programs of loans and guarantees have already been put in place (with the risks ultimately borne by taxpayers), and the EU has facilitated direct capital injections into companies by relaxing its state-aid rules. If the crisis worsens, one could imagine the establishment or expansion of large state holding companies to take over distressed private firms, as in the United States and Europe during the Great Depression.\n\nGreater intervention by the public sector is justified by the emergency for as long as exceptional circumstances persist, but must be provided in a transparent manner and with clear sunset clauses.\n\nPolicies in support of households, businesses, and the financial sector will involve a mix of liquidity measures (provision of credit, postponement of financial obligations) and solvency measures (transfers of real resources; see table).\n\nSeveral tradeoffs will need to be managed. If transfers or subsidized loans are given to a large corporation, they should be conditional on preserving jobs and limiting CEO compensation, dividends, and stock repurchases. Bankruptcy would ensure that equity holders share some of the costs, but would also cause significant economic dislocation. An intermediate option is for the government to take an equity stake in the firm. When liquidity is the problem, credit by the central bank (through asset purchase programs) or other government controlled financial intermediaries (through loans and guarantees) has proven effective in previous crises. Many practical questions arise also in identifying and supporting hard-hit small- and medium-sized enterprises or self-employed individuals. For these, direct transfers based on past tax payments should be considered.\n\nThese domestic policies need to be supported by maintaining international trade and cooperation, which are essential to defeating the pandemic and maximizing the chances of a quick recovery. Limiting the movement of people is necessary for containment. But countries must resist the instinct of shutting down trade, especially for health-care items and the free exchange of scientific information.\n\nFrom shelter-in-place to recovery\n\nPromoting the recovery will have its own challenges, including higher levels of public debt and possibly new swaths of the economy under government control. But relative success in Phase 1 will ensure that economic policy can go back to its normal operation. Fiscal measures to boost demand will become increasingly effective as more people are allowed to leave their homes and go back to work.\n\nInterest rates and inflation were projected to be low-for-long prior to the pandemic in most advanced economies. Preventing major disruptions in supply chains should avoid inflation during the emergency and recovery phases. If the measures to contain the spread of the virus are successful, the necessary increase in the public debt ratio will have been sizable, but interest rates and aggregate demand are likely to remain low in the recovery phase. Under those circumstances, fiscal stimulus will be appropriate and highly effective in most advanced economies. And this will facilitate exit from the exceptional measures introduced during the crisis."

The lockdown measures that have been in place in Italy since 9 March will continue until at least the middle of April, according to health minister Roberto Speranza.\n\nNew cases and deaths continue to accelerate in Spain, the UK and the US. Yesterday US president Donald Trump said that between 100,000 and 240,000 people will die in the US from the outbreak. The president has been strongly criticised for downplaying the expected impact of the crisis over the last two months.\n\n\n\nOther coronavirus developments\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGovernments around the world are considering whether to recommend that everyone wears face masks in their daily lives. Taiwan has made these mandatory on trains and buses, and Austria plans to make masks compulsory for supermarket shoppers. The US Coronavirus Task Force is considering suggesting that everyone wears face masks, as is Germany.\n\n\n\nIn the UK, there is continuing concern over the low levels of coronavirus testing. The government has blamed a global shortage of the required chemicals, but the UK Chemicals Industry Association have said there is no shortage.

It is important that countries work together, learn from each other and harmonise the efforts.” Asked by New Scientist about the new measures announced by the UK yesterday, he said he applauded them. “We are pleased to see the UK is getting into the mainstream and stepping up its efforts.”\n\nUK health service under pressure\n\nThe UK’s chief scientific advisor Patrick Vallance said today there were probably around 55,000 cases in the country, as official cases jumped to 1950, up 407 on yesterday. By comparison to the roughly 8000 annual deaths from the flu he said it would be a “good outcome” if the UK’s new measures kept coronavirus deaths to below 20,000.\n\n“But I mean it is still horrible; that’s still an enormous number of deaths and an enormous pressure on the health service,” Vallance told MPs on the health and social care committee. Asked why schools had not closed yet as they have in other countries, he said it did not have as much impact as other measures at slowing the virus’s spread, and it had “complicating effects”, including children mixing with grandparents, and the impact on the National Health Service workforce. But he said: “It’s absolutely still on the table.”\n\nThe chief executive of the NHS, Simon Stevens, said in response to the crisis the health service was freeing up 30,000 of 100,000 acute care beds for coronavirus patients. He also announced the NHS was stopping all non-urgent surgery from 15 April for three months.

            "content": "Chinese medical supplies' 'quality concerns' overblown\n\nGlobal Times\n\nBy GT staff reporters Source:Global Times Published: 2020/3/31 1:13:40\n\nVast majority up to standard despite remaining risks\n\nAs China mounted a nationwide effort to produce desperately needed medical supplies, concerns over the quality of some Chinese-made equipment have been raised, and some foreign media outlets and politicians have even attempted to hype up recent incidents to smear China's manufacturing sector and its intention to help other countries.\n\nOn Monday, the Financial Times claimed that countries are \"rejecting\" Chinese-made pandemic-fighting supplies, citing issues raised by the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey over certain products exported by China, including face masks and testing kits. The newspaper even took aim at China's donations, quoting an EU official describing it as \"politics of generosity.\" Some even took it one step further, spreading conspiracy theories about how Chinese masks and other medical supplies could make people sick and even kill them.\n\nHowever, by interviewing over a dozen companies and industry insiders and analyzing recent media reports and a series of Chinese official documents, the Global Times discovered that while risks of quality issues do exist due to a combination of factors from illegal production activities to improper procurement channels, shortages in crucial foreign materials and loopholes in foreign regulations that require attention from all governments, a vast majority of Chinese-made medical equipment is not only up to standard but has helped many countries around the world to stem the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHyping up and politicizing quality issues based on several individual cases is not only counterproductive in the global fight against the pandemic but could also be dangerous going forward, as many countries are running out of the life-saving equipment, Chinese officials, businesses and analysts warned.\n\nChinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also warned against politicizing the issue in a Monday routine briefing.\n\nIssues with masks\n\nQuestions over the quality of Chinese-made masks have gained much attention after Dutch authorities ordered a recall of 600,000 face masks from China citing a variety of issues including masks not fitting health workers' mouths properly and not having sufficient filters. Dutch officials said that the KN95 masks should filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles, but the masks couldn't filter them out.\n\nWhile the Netherlands did not provide further details, the issues might have much to do with the fabric used in the masks to filter out airborne particles - a material that China relies on importing from Switzerland and Turkey, according to Chen Lianjie, an executive at Zhejiang Kanglidi Medical Articles Co.\n\n\"There is a shortage of meltblown nonwoven fabric,\" Chen on Monday told the Global Times, noting that many fabrics in the market are labeled as capable of filtering out between 95 percent and 99 percent of particles, but tests show that this is only around 70 percent. To make high-quality fabric would also require equipment from Germany, which is dealing with its own shortages at home.\n\n\"This is the source of the problems faced by China's medical-grade mask production,\" Chen said.\n\nThere are two different types of masks - one that is only good for filtering out particles and the other is classed as medical-grade that can filter out the virus. But due to surging demand, there has been a \"mix of good and bad\" in the market, Chen said.\n\nSome Chinese companies have been engaged in illegal production and selling of masks and other medical products, and China has responded by stepping up crackdowns on these companies, according to Chinese officials.\n\nThe State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on Monday released its 10th round of examples of five companies and individuals that have been engaged in illegal production and sales. Officials confiscated the products and issued fines up to 1.18 million yuan ($166,130).\n\nHowever, issues regarding quality of masks does not stop here. There are also a slew of problems in regards to the process of obtaining export certificates and foreign procurement channels, according to companies and industry analysts.\n\nA majority of certifications are granted by intermediary agents in China hired by foreign governments. For instance, 90 percent of these so-called \"US Food and Drug Administration\" certifications are granted by these agents which are not approved by US authorities, which raised problems for trading process, according to a Shandong-based trader.\n\n\"If they don't purchase through officially recommended channels, foreign buyers may face products with differing quality standards, especially in regards those newly established producers which might not have obtained comprehensive certification before exporting products overseas,\" the trader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Global Times on Monday, adding that certain foreign purchasing agents haven't followed a list of suppliers provided by Chinese officials because they are in a rush.\n\nWhat made such irregularities possible are changing standards from foreign governments. Both the EU and the US have lowered market restrictions for the import of masks and other medical supplies due to shortages at home, including lowered tariffs and fast-tracked procedures, according to the China International Chamber of Commerce (CICC) on Monday.\n\nFor example, the EU has allowed Chinese medical products to be exported even before they gained regulatory approval or without the \"Chinese export\" label, the CICC said.\n\nRegarding the masks the Dutch officials have asked recall, it was unclear whether they had gained proper\n\ncertification and were purchased through proper channels as the officials did not disclose the source of the masks.\n\nTest kit accuracy\n\nMany issues experienced recently in mask exports, including purchases made through channels unverified by Chinese authorities, are also faced by other medical supplies, such as crucial testing kits, which have faced inaccuracy claims.\n\nThe Spanish government last week withdrew 8,000 orders of rapid testing kits from China because of inaccurate results, according to media reports. Some other countries, including the Philippines and the Czech Republic, have also reportedly claimed that some Chinese-made testing kits are inaccurate.\n\nHowever, probing into these incidents also revealed that foreign procurement agents and officials failed to follow specific instructions released by Chinese authorities. In the case of the Czech Republic, local health officials did not follow instructions on how to use the testing kits.\n\nThe Spanish government purchased the testing kits in question from a company called Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology. But the Chinese Embassy in Spain said that the company was not approved by Chinese authorities and was not included on a list of 12 suppliers the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) provided to Spanish officials. Bioeasy also said in a statement on Friday that Spanish health workers probably have not followed instructions provided by the company in collecting testing samples.\n\nAn insider close to the matter told the Global Times on Monday that the intermediary for the purchase had contacted several manufacturers in China but decided to buy from the Shenzhen-based firm because it was the first to respond.\n\n\"Such incidents reflect an eagerness of foreign companies and governments to seek medical supplies in order to meet growing domestic demand, however, some have been so anxious in inking orders that they sometimes ignore strict quality control procedures,\" said the insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThat was also the case with the incident in the Philippines, where officials claimed that some Chinese-made testing kits produced inaccurate results.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in the Philippines said on Sunday that those testing kits were not donations from the Chinese government and did not receive any kit samples for lab validation. The Philippines' health department also apologized for the comments and said that all testing kits donated by China are up to standards.\n\nIn the case of the Czech Republic, where some media reports claimed that inaccuracy rates of rapid testing kits from China were 80 percent, the problem may have been \"improper use\" by some Czech officials, the Chinese Embassy in the Czech Republic said on Friday, adding that the claim was false.\n\nTest results could also vary given the different types of methods and different performances conducted by officials, according to analysts.\n\nCurrently, there are two types of testing methods for COVID-19 that have been approved by China's National Medical Products Administration: nucleic acid and antibody testing methods. While antibody testing methods produce results in 15 minutes, the nucleic acid testing has \"strong specificity and relatively high sensitivity,\" according to a statement from the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines.\n\nUnlike masks and other products, production of such test kits does not rely on foreign imports of materials and technologies, according to an executive from BGI, noting that the company developed its own test kits, and all production materials are made domestically.\n\nTherefore, the primary problem behind concerns regarding testing kits may have more to do with the source of such kits and the ability of foreign health workers to use them properly, according to industry insiders.\n\n\"For some complicated products, we cannot say that all importers know how to use them. Some importers probably did not use them as instructed,\" Li Yong, deputy chairman of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, told the Global Times on Monday.\n\nAs of March 23, China has approved 20 types of nucleic acid and antibody testing kits made by Chinese companies, according to a list posted by the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines on March 24.\n\nVentilators\n\nWhile so far quality concerns have been focused on products such as masks and testing kits, there could also be risks of quality and price irregularities for other devices from China such as ventilators and infrared thermometers, which have become a hot commodity as the number of COVID-19 cases surge overseas, industry insiders and analysts warned.\n\nChina has received 20,000 orders for ventilators from overseas customers and more orders are under discussion, Xu Kemin, an official with the Chinese Ministry of Information and Technology (MIIT), told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China has already exported 1,700 ventilators, half of the country's output this year.\n\nHowever, like masks and some other products, the production of ventilators also relies on supplies of key materials from overseas, including from Europe.\n\n\"Expanding production scale is not an easy thing given the impact of the pandemic, and meeting all demands is unrealistic,\" Xu said.\n\nThat could lead to pricing speculation and even have impacts on the quality, as there have already been irregular sales activities.\n\nBeijing Aeonmed Co, which exports ventilators, said that there have been reports of resales of its products for higher prices and the company has nothing to do with them. Li Kai, an executive of the company, told the Global Times that the company has not raised the price of its ventilators and all its products go through inspections before being exported overseas.\n\nCui Gang, clinical director of Beijing Siriusmed Medical Devices, another ventilator producer, also said that the company has been focused on quality of its products and, despite rising costs, have not raised prices. Cui said that the company's ventilators are priced between 100,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan one unit.\n\n\"Currently, we mainly get orders via existing foreign dealers and governments and the manufacturing is in strict line with the time the orders are received,\" Cui said.\n\nThough ventilators are hard to produce, there could also be some sub-standard ones emerging given market demand, and foreign purchases should be made through proper channels, insiders warned.\n\nXu with the MIIT said on Monday that there are 21 Chinese companies that can produce ventilators, but only eight have received certification from the EU.\n\nThe same risks also exist for Chinese-made infrared thermometers, which are used to check body temperatures in potentially tracking down COVID-19 cases, as foreign demand is skyrocketing and domestic production is strained by shortages of foreign components, insiders said.\n\nDu Han, CEO of Beijing-based Comper Healthcare, which produces 10 percent of China's total infrared thermometers, said that domestic production relies on imports of sensors and chips from Japan and other countries, which are also facing their own shortages.\n\nSimilar to masks, the market for infrared thermometers is in chaos, as substandard products are being sold in the market, Du said.\n\n\"Some companies do not have the certification to produce infrared thermometers. So they are illegal producers,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, MOFCOM said that along with other agencies, it would intensify efforts to ensure export orders of medical products and crack down on counterfeit products. The ministry also said that it would release a list of requirements for export of medical products and urged foreign procurement agents to purchase products that are on par with these requirements.\n\nPoliticizing - the biggest issue\n\nWhile issues exist regarding the quality of certain products, the biggest problem Chinese products face is ideologically driven bias toward everything associated with China, Chinese businesses and analysts said.\n\n\"There have been some biased tendencies among some people, including politicians, to smear China's medical supply production. Such noise is counterproductive in the fight against the pandemic.\n\nSuch political motivations are evil,\" said Li, the trade expert, adding that specific issues should be addressed through collaboration.\n\nHua Chunying, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, on Monday also warned against politicizing quality issues, which should be addressed based on facts, and she said that China's help is sincere. Hua also noted that China has also received substandard medical supplies from other countries, but \"we chose to have faith in and respect other countries' goodwill.\"\n\nResponding to some foreign officials' comments over China using the medical supplies as \"propaganda,\" Hua asked rhetorically: \"Do they wish for China to sit idly by and be indifferent, while watching people in many countries suffering in pain due to the pandemic and more people lose their lives?\""

            "content": "How well has the European Union handled the Covid-19 pandemic? Dionyssis G. Dimitrakopoulos and Georgette Lalis present a detailed analysis of the EU’s actions thus far in the outbreak. They write that despite a slow and initially haphazard approach, there has ultimately been a substantial response.\n\nPublic health care systems, alongside state bureaucracies and public finances, are being tested to their limits by the Covid-19 pandemic. The same can be said – albeit in a different way – about the European Union. Indeed, since the problem at hand knows no borders, appealing to an organisation that operates at the ‘supranational’ level is not an unreasonable reaction to a crisis such as this and an existential threat like this pandemic. So, how has the EU fared thus far in this process?\n\nIn what can only be a preliminary assessment, we argue that despite not having the legal powers to deal with the core element of this crisis (which started as a health issue first and foremost), the EU has done much more than meets the eye after what can be perceived (albeit not fairly – see below) as a slow start that has been marked by Christine Lagarde’s monumental blunder of 12 March that exacerbated Italy’s financial problems and reportedly forced her to apologise to the European Central Bank’s Governing Council. Nevertheless, the jury is still out because the implementation of these measures will necessarily take time. Also, many of them (in the economic sphere) may amount to nothing short of a paradigm shift and opposition will not give up that easily (see below).\n\nA matter of legal competence alone? Yes and no\n\nThe treaty\n\nAny such assessment – if it is to be fair – must start from the issue of legal competence to act in such matters. In relation to the pandemic’s pure public health basis, it is important to note that there is no common EU health policy in place because organising and delivering public health care is the purview of national governments. Indeed, until 1992 and the Maastricht Treaty (Art. 129) the EU treaty did not even contain a direct reference to public health.\n\nPost-Lisbon, the treaty stipulates that while the Union’s action will merely complement national policies, it will cover (inter alia) ‘the fight against the major health scourges, by promoting research into their causes, their transmission and their prevention, as well as health information and education, and monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health’. Nevertheless, various other legal provisions have been used to regulate health-related issues ranging from standards for medical professions to pharmaceuticals, medical devices, human blood, health and safety at the workplace, anti-cancer/tobacco measures and last but not least free movement of patients and the famous European Health Insurance Card.\n\nThe agencies\n\nThe European Medicines Agency seeks to facilitate the development of and access to medicines, evaluates applications for marketing authorisation, contributes to monitoring the safety of medicines across their lifecycle and disseminates information to patients and professionals. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is the EU agency that – since its establishment in 2004 – collaborates with national health authorities across Europe so as to ‘identify, assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases’ by means of the collection, assessment and dissemination of data, the provision of scientific opinions and technical assistance (including training) and fostering the exchange of information and best practices.\n\nIn case of a pandemic, the Early Warning and Response System links the European Commission, the ECDC and the European Economic Area’s national public health authorities that are in charge of countering serious cross-border threats to health, and it is used ‘for notifications on outbreaks, exchanging information and decisions about the coordination of measures among Member States’, including in cases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola virus disease, avian influenza in humans and other communicable diseases.\n\nAlthough the European Commission has established the procedure whereby alerts (and corresponding measures) are notified via this system in relation to serious cross-border threats to health, ultimately member states are in charge of making and implementing the decisions. Earlier this month, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly vetoed the Department of Health’s request to retain post-Brexit access to this system. Finally, EU member states and the European Commission seek to co-ordinate their views on issues under discussion by the World Health Organization.\n\nThere are other, at least equally significant, ways in which the EU affects public health policy in case of a pandemic at the national level. After all, it started off as a public health crisis but is quickly morphing into a major economic and social crisis too. Three out of the four single market freedoms, namely the free movement of persons, services and goods can be affected by the pandemic, including export bans on sensitive public health products, import controls, the movement of health professionals, closing of frontiers and prohibition of citizens’ movement around Europe.\n\nWith industrial production and consumption coming to a halt, and workers being forced to stay at home, action is required on the economic and monetary policy fronts, including for the members of the Euro Area that must comply with very tight limits on public spending and borrowing. Nevertheless, these countries differ in terms of financial wealth and the capacity of their national health care systems.\n\nSo, what form has the EU’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic taken thus far? Does the impression match reality?\n\nAn initially haphazard but ultimately substantial response\n\nA slow start in relation to public health?\n\nThe bulk of this response begun unfolding in March although the ECDC had noted as early as on 9 January reports of 59 pneumonia cases ‘possibly associated with a novel coronavirus’ in Wuhan, China that has direct flight links to London, Paris and Rome and pointed that ‘[c]onsidering there is no indication of human-to-human transmission and no cases detected outside of China, the likelihood of introduction to the EU is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded. However, more epidemiological and laboratory information is needed in order to elaborate a comprehensive assessment of this event and the possible risk for the international spread.’\n\nThe ECDC provided further updates on 14 January and 25 January, in the latter case noting a) the first reported (and not unexpected) cases within the EU (all with a direct link to Wuhan), b) ‘the fact that these cases were identified, proves that detection and confirmation of this novel virus is working in France, showing a high level of preparedness to prevent and control possible infections of 2019-nCoV’, c) the fact that ‘[m]ost EU countries have plans and measures in place to contain this kind of infection and Europe has well-equipped laboratories that can confirm probable cases in addition to hospitals that are prepared to treat patients accordingly’ and d) urged EU/EEA countries to ‘ensure that timely and rigorous infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are applied around people diagnosed with 2019-nCoV’.\n\nThe ECDC also warned that ‘it is likely that there will be more imported cases in Europe. Even if there are still many things unknown about 2019-nCoV, European countries have the necessary capacities to prevent and control an outbreak as soon as cases are detected.’ Three days later, following a fourth case within the EU, the ECDC was noting that ‘[t]he source of infection is unknown and could still be active. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed but more information is needed […] As this is a rapidly evolving situation, ECDC is revising its risk assessment for Europe.’ It is unclear whether or the extent to which this reaction was due to inadequate information and the alleged cover up by the Chinese authorities of aspects of the problem.\n\nA series of decisions (following frequent teleconferences of the ministers of health and the ministers of the interior of the 27 member states) were made without attracting the publicity that was rightly given to subsequent measures (see below). They included a statement (13 February, i.e. almost a month before the WHO declared a pandemic) of the 27 health ministers undertaking to seek to limit the damage caused by the virus by sharing information, resources and equipment within a broader cross-European strategy entailing ‘close and enhanced coordination between Member States to ensure effectiveness of all measures (including in relation to diagnosis and treatment), including, if necessary, measures regarding travel, while safeguarding the free movement within the EU’ as well as the adoption of a common approach seeking to limit the spread of the virus until a vaccine becomes available.\n\nThis approach entails tests to all airline passengers entering the Union via all major airports, extensive lock-down measures, the publication of detailed information on national capabilities (such as stocks of ventilators, drips, intensive care beds and anti-viral drugs) and a decision ‘to oversee the re-allocation of equipment and the re-distribution of healthcare professionals to member states in need’. On 2 March the Croatian presidency escalated the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR) arrangements from information sharing mode to full activation mode so as to identify major gaps across sectors and elaborate concrete EU response measures.\n\nIndustrial, trade and state aid measures\n\nRhetoric as well as decisions that have highlighted the need for co-ordination cannot conceal a national reflex despite the cross-border nature of the pandemic. For example, the European Commission, in addition to seeking to promote a co-ordinated approach, has had to react to the decision of individual member states to put in place restrictions to the export of ‘an increasing range of products, starting with Personal Protective Equipment and extending more recently to medicines […] [that] create bottlenecks to production of essential supplies by locking inputs in specific Member States […], ultimately […] reintroduce internal borders at a time where solidarity between Member States is the most needed and they put obstacles to the effective protection of the health and lives of all’.\n\nRestrictions such as these have subsequently been lifted or modified in accordance with the Commission’s observations but the image of individual states acting on their own remains very potent and is reflective of a broader trend (see below). The European Commission has acknowledged that the situation in Italy has been ‘exacerbated by the fact that several Member States have adopted/are adopting national measures, such as export bans, which seriously disrupt the already strained supply chain. The Commission has therefore insisted that Member States refrain from adopting/implementing such untargeted national measures and requested that they cooperate for implementation of an effective EU-wide approach, based on solidarity among Member States.’ It is, however, worth noting that the treaty (Art. 36) allows some prohibitions or restrictions on trade if ‘justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants’ etc. as long as these do not ‘constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.’ It is difficult to argue that arbitrary discrimination applies in this case.\n\nOn 10 March the European Council decided to a) ask the Commission to analyse the needs in relation to the provision of medical equipment and to propose initiatives to prevent shortages (in response to which it successfully launched joint public procurement in relation to personal protective equipment), b) agreed to ensure that the internal market functions properly and any unjustified obstacles are avoided and c) declared that the Union and the member states ‘stand ready to make use of all instruments that are necessary’. On 19 March the European Commission decided to create the first ever strategic ‘rescEU’ stockpile of medical equipment (e.g. ventilators, personal protective equipment, lab supplies) so as to assist EU member states in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe European Commission has also announced the adoption of rules enabling member states to support the economy by making full use of the flexibility foreseen under the EU’s current state aid regime through the provision of liquidity and supporting the continuity of economic activity during the pandemic. Specifically, the aforementioned new arrangement provides for a) direct grants, selective tax advantages and advance payments; b) state guarantees for company loans from banks; c)subsidised public loans to companies; d)safeguards for banks that channel state aid to the real economy and e)short-term export credit insurance. It has subsequently authorised several such measures from a broad range of member states.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission has instigated the release of the European standards that apply to crucial medical devices and personal protective equipment (e.g. masks, gloves, gowns) thus facilitating the task of companies that are willing to swiftly start production and place products on the internal market more easily whilst also ensuring safety. Exceptionally, it has also authorised the placing on the market of non-EU marked medical equipment.\n\nFreedom of movement\n\nThe national approach of several member states was particularly evident in this area. Restrictions placed on the movement of people between the member states of the Schengen area were announced individually although they do reflect a previous collective decision (see supra). By 24 March, one by one and acting individually, a total of 14 Schengen countries (in order of notification: Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Switzerland, Denmark, Poland, Lithuania, Germany, Estonia, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Finland and Belgium) had informed the Commission that they had reinstated border controls in response to the pandemic. These decisions affect in particular but not only crossborder workers. Acting in a more systemic manner, the Commission proposed temporary restrictions on non-essential travel from third countries into the EU, which the European Council endorsed politically via teleconference on 17 March and the member states are gradually putting into place.\n\nFinancing the economy: a paradigm shift?\n\nDespite reported opposition from (among others in a small minority) the head of the German central bank who as recently as 28 February was reportedly saying that “This is a very complex monetary policy issue which, in my view, does not require acute monetary policy action”, the European Central Bank launched two programmes, namely: a) a new Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme with an envelope of €750 billion until the end of the year, which has had a direct calming effect in bond markets; and b) extra net asset purchases of €120 billion announced on 12 March. The ECB has stated that it will do whatever it takes to fight the expected economic consequences of the pandemic alongside the necessary fiscal effort that is required both at the European and the national level. As Marcel Fratzscher points out, the PEPP programme ‘is much more potent than some have realised so far, and in many ways more potent than the OMT programme’, since it entails no conditionality, it is more flexible and the issue/issuer limit of 33 per cent does not apply to it.\n\nPredictably, the ECB’s decision has already come under attack by some usual suspects. Be that as it may, the logic of the ECB’s plan is to foster financing (including to SMEs and households) as well as – as its chief economist pointed out – to ensure that if necessary, targeted support can be provided (e.g. to Italy). By buying debt issued by governments and firms, it lowers interest rates and helps governments and firms borrow and invest, thus creating jobs and raising income. Assuming other elements of the ECB’s asset purchase programme remain in place, this amounts to more than 1 trillion euros worth of purchases this year and the monetisation of about five per cent of GDP in Covid-19 public debt issuance.\n\nCrucially, for an institution that cares about its reputation as much as it does about its effectiveness, the ECB’s decisions have been praised by a broad range of economists (see, for example, here, here, here, here and here) including in Germany, and have the support of French President Macron but prominent economists such as Paul de Grauwe, Karl Whelan, Thomas Philippon, and Luis Garicano argue further action will be required. For example, the US Senate and the Trump administration have reached agreement on a package worth 2 trillion dollars.\n\nIn mid-March the ECB also announced action (in tandem with other central banks across the globe) in relation to currency swap lines so as to limit the risk of dislocation in the financial sector and a potential procyclical reduction of bank lending. The Commission has also instigated the ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’ whereby 37 billion euros will be directed from the EU’s cohesion budget to the fight against the coronavirus crisis and proposes to extend the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund by also including a public health crisis within its scope.\n\nHowever, the most path-breaking act is the European Commission’s proposal (that the finance ministers of the member states have endorsed) to activate the general escape clause that operates since 2011 under the Euro Area’s Stability and Growth Pact so as to enable ‘a coordinated and orderly temporary deviation from the normal requirements for all Member States in a situation of generalised crisis caused by a severe economic downturn either in Euro Area or the EU as a whole.’ In this way member states will have much more room to pursue fiscal policy measures commensurate with the scale of the crisis.\n\nIt is worth noting that these economic measures have been adopted in addition to the national measures introduced by national governments, the most emblematic of which is the German government’s. There is no doubt that fiscal policy measures too are needed if the EU is to limit the damage done by the pandemic, as Isabel Schnabel too, pointedly noted.\n\nFurther proposals abound. Hundreds of social scientists (including prominent figures such as Thomas Piketty and Mark Blyth) signed an open letter to the European Council (published in the FT) calling for Eurobonds. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for a ‘Marshall Plan’ also involving joint bonds. He is one of nine heads of state or governments who support common debt issuance. As expected, Dutch PM Mark Rutte opposes them as does Chancellor Merkel. No wonder the teleconference of the European Council on 26 March ended in failure. Martin Sandbu proposed the use of ‘helicopter money’.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs is always the case, ‘Brussels’ is not hard to blame or criticise. On this occasion though, we argue that criticism must be confined to speed, rather than the substance. After a slow start, the EU has deployed its full panoply across a whole range of policy areas in an effort to counter the devastating consequences of this pandemic.\n\nAs Guy Verhofstadt rightly noted, ‘Covid-19 showed how little it means to be European in times of crisis. It made one thing clear: the Eurosceptic mantra of the ‘European Superstate’ becoming more ridiculous by the day. People see the European Directorate [sic] for Health and Food Safety and the European Medicine Agency and think: they have the tools and money, why don’t they act? The answer is: because – just like Europol is not a real police force – these European health administrations do not have any real powers to act. They are largely – you get it – “coordinating” bodies; assembling information and data from all over Europe and sending it back and forth between member states; the most what they can do, is issuing recommendations. What is absolutely insufficient in times of pandemic. Then it is the 27 health ministers who take it over and are supposed to launch decisive collective action. Or more correctly – as we have seen – mainly fail to streamline their actions.’\n\nThe national tendencies of several member states were initially quite prominent. Nevertheless, as Commissioner Johansson reportedly noted, in this crisis EU member states acted like humans do – the first instinct being to fend for themselves, until they realised the value of cooperation. It remains to be seen whether the joint action that has followed will be effective but there are some lessons that the EU can already draw.\n\nFirst, those who – like Bill Gates – have been arguing that the West ought to pay much more attention to this kind of issue, clearly have a point. Second, some of the capability that the Chinese state possesses and has mobilised to counter the virus, is clearly unwelcome and not feasible in Europe. This does not mean that Europeans cannot be educated in combatting pandemics so that the next one finds us better prepared. Third, capability-wise, Europe should invest in new medicines (i.e. R&D), testing materials, and the security of supply of key equipment so that they are available when needed. This also means increasing the production of critical equipment within the EU.\n\nFourth, the EU should strengthen its decision-making process in times of crisis to ensure efficiency, speed and visibility. The recent proposal made by the President of the European Council is a step in the right direction. Subsidiarity in normal times is fine in areas where competence is shared between levels of governance, but this pandemic is a cross-border issue that can be better handled at the European level with better co-ordinated and science-based decisions. If the ‘supranational’ centre remains weak or docile, those who stand to lose ultimately include EU citizens as well as the member states themselves. So, more confidence in the Commission’s capacity to coordinate would be welcome, as would more visibility in relation to its activity.\n\nFinally, it is high time austerity policies were reviewed now that everyone knows that it has undermined public health systems’ ability to combat pandemics.\n\n________________\n\n\n\nNote: The above was first published on LSE EUROPP.

            "content": "The deserted streets will fill again, and we will leave our screen-lit burrows blinking with relief. But the world will be different from how we imagined it in what we thought were normal times. This is not a temporary rupture in an otherwise stable equilibrium: the crisis through which we are living is a turning point in history.\n\nThe era of peak globalisation is over. An economic system that relied on worldwide production and long supply chains is morphing into one that will be less interconnected. A way of life driven by unceasing mobility is shuddering to a stop. Our lives are going to be more physically constrained and more virtual than they were. A more fragmented world is coming into being that in some ways may be more resilient.\n\nThe once formidable British state is being rapidly reinvented, and on a scale not seen before. Acting with emergency powers authorised by parliament, the government has tossed economic orthodoxy to the winds. Savaged by years of imbecilic austerity, the NHS – like the armed forces, police, prisons, fire service, care workers and cleaners – has its back to the wall. But with the noble dedication of its workers, the virus will be held at bay. Our political system will survive intact. Not many countries will be so fortunate. Governments everywhere are struggling through the narrow passage between suppressing the virus and crashing the economy. Many will stumble and fall.\n\nIn the view of the future to which progressive thinkers cling, the future is an embellished version of the recent past. No doubt this helps them preserve some semblance of sanity. It also undermines what is now our most vital attribute: the ability to adapt and fashion different ways of life. The task ahead is to build economies and societies that are more durable, and more humanly habitable, than those that were exposed to the anarchy of the global market.\n\ndoes not mean a shift to small-scale localism. Human numbers are too large for local self-sufficiency to be viable, and most of humankind is not willing to return to the small, closed communities of a more distant past. But the hyperglobalisation of the last few decades is not coming back either. The virus has exposed fatal weaknesses in the economic system that was patched up after the 2008 financial crisis. Liberal capitalism is bust.\n\nWith all its talk of freedom and choice, liberalism was in practice the experiment of dissolving traditional sources of social cohesion and political legitimacy and replacing them with the promise of rising material living standards. This experiment has now run its course. Suppressing the virus necessitates an economic shutdown that can only be temporary, but when the economy restarts, it will be in a world where governments act to curb the global market.\n\nA situation in which so many of the world’s essential medical supplies originate in China – or any other single country – will not be tolerated. Production in these and other sensitive areas will be re-shored as a matter of national security. The notion that a country such as Britain could phase out farming and depend on imports for food will be dismissed as the nonsense it always has been. The airline industry will shrink as people travel less. Harder borders are going to be an enduring feature of the global landscape. A narrow goal of economic efficiency will no longer be practicable for governments.\n\nThe question is, what will replace rising material living standards as the basis of society? One answer green thinkers have given is what John Stuart Mill in his Principles of Political Economy (1848) called a “stationary-state economy”. Expanding production and consumption would no longer be an overriding goal, and the increase in human numbers curbed. Unlike most liberals today, Mill recognised the danger of overpopulation. A world filled with human beings, he wrote, would be one without “flowery wastes” and wildlife. He also understood the dangers of central planning. The stationary state would be a market economy in which competition is encouraged. Technological innovation would continue, along with improvements in the art of living.\n\nIn many ways this is an appealing vision, but it is also unreal. There is no world authority to enforce an end to growth, just as there is none to fight the virus. Contrary to the progressive mantra, recently repeated by Gordon Brown, global problems do not always have global solutions. Geopolitical divisions preclude anything like world government. If one existed, existing states would compete to control it. The belief that this crisis can be solved by an unprecedented outbreak of international cooperation is magical thinking in its purest form.\n\nOf course economic expansion is not indefinitely sustainable. For one thing, it can only worsen climate change and turn the planet into a garbage dump. But with highly uneven living standards, still rising human numbers and intensifying geopolitical rivalries, zero growth is also unsustainable. If the limits of growth are eventually accepted, it will be because governments make the protection of their citizens their most important objective. Whether democratic or authoritarian, states that do not meet this Hobbesian test will fail.\n\n***\n\nThe pandemic has abruptly accelerated geopolitical change. Combined with the collapse in oil prices, the uncontrolled spread of the virus in Iran could destabilise its theocratic regime. With revenues plunging, Saudi Arabia is also at risk. No doubt many will wish both of them good riddance. But there can be no assurance that a meltdown in the Gulf will produce anything other than a long period of chaos. Despite years of talk about diversifying, these regimes are still hostages of oil and even if the price recovers somewhat, the economic hit of the global shutdown will be devastating.\n\nIn contrast, the advance of East Asia will surely continue. The most successful responses to the epidemic thus far have been in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. It is hard to believe their cultural traditions, which focus on collective well-being more than personal autonomy, have not played a role in their success. They have also resisted the cult of the minimal state. It will not be surprising if they adjust to de-globalisation better than many Western countries.\n\nChina’s position is more complex. Given its record of cover-ups and opaque statistics, its performance during the pandemic is hard to assess. Certainly it is not a model any democracy could or should emulate. As the new NHS Nightingale shows, it is not only authoritarian regimes that can build hospitals in two weeks. No one knows the full human costs of the Chinese shutdown. Even so, Xi Jinping’s regime looks to have benefited from the pandemic. The virus has provided a rationale for expanding the surveillance state and introducing even stronger political control. Instead of wasting the crisis, Xi is using it to expand the country’s influence. China is inserting itself in place of the EU by assisting distressed national governments, such as Italy. Many of the masks and testing kits it has supplied have proved to be faulty, but the fact seems not to have dented Beijing’s propaganda campaign.\n\nThe EU has responded to the crisis by revealing its essential weakness. Few ideas are so scorned by higher minds than sovereignty. In practice it signifies the capacity to execute a comprehensive, coordinated and flexible emergency plan of the kind being implemented in the UK and other countries. The measures that have already been taken are larger than any implemented in the Second World War. In their most important respects they are also the opposite of what was done then, when the British population was mobilised as never before, and unemployment fell dramatically. Today, aside from those in essential services, Britain’s workers have been demobilised. If it goes on for many months, the shutdown will demand an even larger socialisation of the economy.\n\nWhether the desiccated neoliberal structures of the EU can do anything like this is doubtful. Hitherto sacrosanct rules have been torn up by the European Central Bank’s bond buying programme and relaxing limits on state aid to industry. But the resistance to fiscal burden-sharing of northern European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands may block the way to rescuing Italy – a country too big to be crushed like Greece, but possibly also too costly to save. As the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte said in March: “If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d’être for the people.” The Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic has been blunter and more realistic: “European solidarity does not exist… that was a fairy tale. The only country that can help us in this hard situation is the People’s Republic of China. To the rest of them, thanks for nothing.”\n\nThe EU’s fundamental flaw is that it is incapable of discharging the protective functions of a state. The break-up of the eurozone has been predicted so often that it may seem unthinkable. Yet under the stresses they face today, the disintegration of European institutions is not unrealistic. Free movement has already been shut down. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s recent blackmailing of the EU by threatening to allow migrants to pass through his borders, and the endgame in Syria’s Idlib province, could lead to hundreds of thousands, even millions, of refugees fleeing to Europe. (It is hard to see what social distancing might mean in huge, overcrowded and insanitary refugee camps.) Another migrant crisis in conjunction with pressure on the dysfunctional euro could prove fatal.\n\nIf the EU survives, it may be as something like the Holy Roman empire in its later years, a phantom that lingers on for generations while power is exercised elsewhere. Vitally necessary decisions are already being taken by nation states. Since the political centre is no longer a leading force and with much of the left wedded to the failed European project, many governments will be dominated by the far right.\n\nAn increasing influence on the EU will come from Russia. In the struggle with the Saudis that triggered the oil price collapse in March 2020, Putin has played the stronger hand. Whereas for the Saudis the fiscal break-even level – the price needed to pay for public services and keep the state solvent – is around $80 a barrel, for Russia it may be less than half that. At the same time Putin is consolidating Russia’s position as an energy power. The Nord Stream offshore pipelines that run through the Baltics secure reliable supplies of natural gas to Europe. By the same token they lock Europe into dependency on Russia and enable it to use energy as a political weapon. With Europe balkanised, Russia, too, looks set to expand its sphere of influence. Like China it is stepping in to replace the faltering EU, flying in doctors and equipment to Italy.\n\nIn the US, Donald Trump plainly considers refloating the economy more important than containing the virus. A 1929-style stock market slide and unemployment levels worse than those in the 1930s could pose an existential threat to his presidency. James Bullard, the CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, has suggested the American jobless rate could reach 30 per cent – higher than in the Great Depression. On the other hand, with the US’s decentralised system of government; a ruinously expensive healthcare system and tens of millions uninsured; a colossal prison population, of which many are old and infirm; and cities with sizeable numbers of homeless people and an already large opioid epidemic; curtailing the shutdown could mean the virus spreading uncontrollably, with devastating effects. (Trump is not alone in taking this risk. Sweden has not so far imposed anything like the lockdown in force in other countries.)\n\nUnlike the British programme, Trump’s $2trn stimulus plan is mostly another corporate bailout. Yet if polls are to be believed increasing numbers of Americans approve of his handling of the epidemic. What if Trump emerges from this catastrophe with the support of an American majority?\n\nWhether or not he retains his hold on power, the US’s position in the world has changed irreversibly. What is fast unravelling is not only the hyperglobalisation of recent decades but the global order set in place at the end of the Second World War. Puncturing an imaginary equilibrium, the virus has hastened a process of disintegration that has been under way for many years.\n\nIn his seminal Plagues and Peoples the Chicago historian William H McNeill wrote:\n\nIt is always possible that some hitherto obscure parasitic organism may escape its accustomed ecological niche and expose the dense human populations that have become so conspicuous a feature of the Earth to some fresh and perchance devastating mortality.\n\nIt is not yet known how Covid-19 escaped its niche, though there is a suspicion that Wuhan’s “wet markets”, where wildlife is sold, may have played a role. In 1976, when McNeill’s book was first published, the destruction of the habitats of exotic species was nowhere near as far gone as it is today. As globalisation has advanced, so has the risk of infectious diseases spreading. The Spanish Flu of 1918-20 became a global pandemic in a world without mass air transportation. Commenting on how plagues have been understood by historians, McNeill observed: “For them as for others, occasional disastrous outbreaks of infectious disease remained sudden and unpredictable interruptions of the norm, essentially beyond historical explanation.” Many later studies have come to similar conclusions.\n\nYet the notion persists that pandemics are blips rather than an integral part of history. Lying behind this is the belief that humans are no longer part of the natural world and can create an autonomous ecosystem, separate from the rest of the biosphere. Covid-19 is telling them they cannot. It is only by using science that we can defend ourselves against this pestilence. Mass antibody tests and a vaccine will be crucial. But permanent changes in how we live will have to be made if we are to be less vulnerable in future.\n\nThe texture of everyday life is already altered. A sense of fragility is everywhere. It is not only society that feels shaky. So does the human position in the world. Viral images reveal human absence in different ways. Wild boars are roaming in the towns of northern Italy, while in Lopburi in Thailand gangs of monkeys no longer fed by tourists are fighting in the streets. Inhuman beauty and a fierce struggle for life have sprung up in cities emptied by the virus.\n\nAs a number of commentators have noted, a post-apocalyptic future of the kind projected in the fiction of JG Ballard has become our present reality. But it is important to understand what this “apocalypse” reveals. For Ballard, human societies were stage props that could be knocked over at any moment. Norms that seemed built into human nature vanished when you left the theatre. The most harrowing of Ballard’s experiences as a child in 1940s Shanghai were not in the prison camp, where many inmates were steadfast and kindly in their treatment of others. A resourceful and venturesome boy, Ballard enjoyed much of his time there. It was when the camp collapsed as the war drew to a close, he told me, that he witnessed the worst examples of ruthless selfishness and motiveless cruelty.\n\nThe lesson he learnt was that these were not world-ending events. What is commonly described as an apocalypse is the normal course of history. Many are left with lasting traumas. But the human animal is too sturdy and too versatile to be broken by these upheavals. Life goes on, if differently than before. Those who talk of this as a Ballardian moment have not noticed how human beings adjust, and even find fulfilment, in the extreme situations he portrays.\n\nTechnology will help us adapt in our present extremity. Physical mobility can be reduced by shifting many of our activities into cyberspace. Offices, schools, universities, GP surgeries and other work centres are likely to change permanently. Virtual communities set up during the epidemic have enabled people to get to know one another better than they ever did before.\n\nThere will be celebrations as the pandemic recedes, but there may be no clear point when the threat of infection is over. Many people may migrate to online environments like those in Second Life, a virtual world where people meet, trade and interact in bodies and worlds of their choosing. Other adaptations may be uncomfortable for moralists. Online pornography will likely boom, and much internet dating may consist of erotic exchanges that never end in a meeting of bodies. Augmented reality technology may be used to simulate fleshly encounters and virtual sex could soon be normalised. Whether this is a move towards the good life may not be the most useful question to ask. Cyberspace relies on an infrastructure that can be damaged or destroyed by war or natural disaster. The internet allows us to avoid the isolation that plagues have brought in the past. It cannot enable human beings to escape their mortal flesh, or avoid the ironies of progress.\n\n***\n\nWhat the virus is telling us is not only that progress is reversible – a fact even progressives seem to have grasped­ – but that it can be self-undermining. To take the most obvious example, globalisation produced some major benefits – millions have been lifted out of poverty. This achievement is now under threat. Globalisation begat the de-globalisation that is now under way.\n\nAs the prospect of ever-rising living standards fades, other sources of authority and legitimacy are re-emerging. Liberal or socialist, the progressive mind detests national identity with passionate intensity. There is plenty in history to show how it can be misused. But the nation state is increasingly the most powerful force driving large-scale action. Dealing with the virus requires a collective effort that will not be mobilised for the sake of universal humanity.\n\nAltruism has limits just as much as growth. There will be examples of extraordinary selflessness before the worst of the crisis is over. In Britain an over half-million strong volunteer army has signed up to assist the NHS. But it would be unwise to rely on human sympathy alone to get us through. Kindness to strangers is so precious that it must be rationed.\n\nThis is where the protective state comes in. At its core, the British state has always been Hobbesian. Peace and strong government have been the overriding priorities. At the same time this Hobbesian state has mostly rested on consent, particularly in times of national emergency. Being shielded from danger has trumped freedom from interference by government.\n\nHow much of their freedom people will want back when the pandemic has peaked is an open question. They show little taste for the enforced solidarity of socialism, but they may happily accept a regime of bio-surveillance for the sake of better protection of their health. Digging ourselves out of the pit will demand more state intervention not less, and of a highly inventive kind. Governments will have to do a lot more in underwriting scientific research and technological innovation. Though the state may not always be larger its influence will be pervasive, and by old-world standards more intrusive. Post-liberal government will be the norm for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt is only by recognising the frailties of liberal societies that their most essential values can be preserved. Along with fairness they include individual liberty, which as well as being worthwhile in itself is a necessary check on government. But those who believe personal autonomy is the innermost human need betray an ignorance of psychology, not least their own. For practically everyone, security and belonging are as important, often more so. Liberalism was, in effect, a systematic denial of this fact.\n\nAn advantage of quarantine is that it can be used to think afresh. Clearing the mind of clutter and thinking how to live in an altered world is the task at hand. For those of us who are not serving on the front line, this should be enough for the duration."

Trump warned US citizens that the next couple of weeks are going to be \"horrific,\" as the country grapples with the outbreak amid predictions of up to 200,000 deaths.\n\nAbout ventilators, the US will soon have an excess, which it will be distributing to other countries, the president said during his daily briefing. Trump also confirmed the construction of two new hospital ships to help ease the burden on the country's overwhelmed medical system.\n\nIn addition, the US \"will work with the world's largest oil producers to address volatility in global oil markets,\" National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said.\n\nThe Trump administration concluded the news conference by highlighting Iran's refusal to accept the US' offer of help. The Islamic Republic has suffered more than most countries, with over 3,000 deaths and almost 50,000 cases, but longstanding tensions between the two countries appear to have hindered them from working together on the pandemic.\n\n22:11 US Congressman Jim Banks is calling on the State Department to urge China to investigate the disappearance of three Chinese citizen journalists who sought to expose the impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\n21:45 J.K. Rowling, author of the world-renowned Harry Potter books, has launched a new website showcasing content from her novels as a way of staving off boredom for children stuck at home during the pandemic. The British author said her new platform \"Harry Potter at Home\" was aimed at children unable to attend school during these unprecedented times.\n\nThe website includes links to free versions of the first in the Potter series, the 1997 novel \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" available as an e-book or audio book in a number of different languages. Puzzles, games and videos are included, with guides on how to draw creatures from the series.\n\n\"Parents, teachers and carers working to keep children amused and interested while we're on lockdown might need a bit of magic,\" Rowling tweeted, along with a link to the new website.\n\n21:11 A Guatemalan migrant has died during a riot over coronavirus fears at an immigration detention center in Mexico. According to officials, mattresses were burned during the unrest, where inmates displayed their anger over overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions, which they believed could expose them to COVID-19.\n\nAccording to a local migrant shelter in the Tabasco city of Tenosique, 14 other migrants were injured, some seriously, in addition to the death, which was confirmed by the Guatemalan consul in Tabasco.\n\n20:49 A six-week-old baby has died in the United States due to complications relating to the novel coronavirus, the governor of Connecticut has confirmed. Governor Ned Lamont wrote on Twitter that the infant was \"brought unresponsive to a hospital late last week and could not be revived.\"\n\nLamont added: \"Testing confirmed last night that the newborn was COVID-19 positive. This is absolutely heartbreaking. We believe this is one of the youngest lives lost anywhere due to complications relating to COVID-19.\" Last week Illinois authorities said they were looking into the death of a child \"younger than one year\" who had tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n20:40 This year's United Nations' Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, the UK government said Wednesday. The 26th annual climate summit was due to take place in the city of Glasgow in Scotland in November this year.\n\n\"In light of the ongoing, worldwide effects of COVID-19, holding an ambitious, inclusive COP26 in November 2020 is no longer possible,\" a government statement said. It added that dates for a rescheduled conference in 2021 would be announced later.\n\n20:22 Germany's airforce transported four seriously ill coronavirus patients out of Bergamo, Italy, a military spokesman announced. The Airbus A310 MedEvac was to bring the Italian nationals to Cologne, where they are to be treated in civilian hospitals. Germany's airforce carried out similar missions over the weekend.\n\n18:50 The number of coronavirus infections in the United States went over 200,000 on Wednesday, according to statistics kept by the Johns Hopkins University. The university put its count at 203,608 — making the United States the country with the highest number of confirmed infections. At least 4,361 people have died of the virus in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe White House has projected that between 100,000 and 240,000 people will die of the virus in the United States.\n\n18:30 All Israelis are required to wear medical face masks while in public to protect themselves and others from the coronavirus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday.\n\n\"We ask you, citizens of Israel, all of you, to wear masks in the public sphere,\" Netanyahu said in a televised speech. People are welcome to improvise masks in the absence of factory-produced ones, he added.\n\nThe prime minister also said that approaching religious holidays, including the Jewish holiday of Passover, should be celebrated with immediate family members only.\n\nThus far, Israel has reported over 6,000 cases of coronavirus and 24 related fatalities.\n\nMedical facilities around the globe are already struggling to acquire the number of masks needed to handle the influx of coronavirus patients. The problem is bound to be exacerbated as more and more governments require their citizens to wear such masks in public. State and private entities are scrambling to ramp up production to meet the sudden demand.\n\n18:10 More evidence has come out showing that coronavirus infections are being spread by people who do not display obvious symptoms, adding complications to efforts to bring the outbreak under control.\n\nAround 10% of new infections may be caused by people who have the infection but do not experience systems, a study conducted by researchers in Singapore and published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday suggests.\n\nRead more: Up to 30% of coronavirus cases asymptomatic\n\nThe revelations caused the CDC to change its guidance to say that anyone may be considered a coronavirus carrier, regardless of whether they display symptoms.\n\nAn earlier study in China's Hubei province, where the respiratory disease originated, suggested that over 10% of infections may have occurred before people displayed symptoms.\n\nResearchers are also looking into the possibility that infections can also be spread by people who have the illness, recovered, but are still contagious.\n\n16:39 The US state of New York has reported a total of 1,941 coronavirus deaths, up from 1,550 the day before. New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the US, now has 83,712 confirmed cases of coronavirus, compared to 75,795 reported as of Tuesday. Yesterday, the state surpassed the Chinese province of Hubei, where the outbreak began, in terms of total coronavirus cases.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo also said that playgrounds in New York City would be closed in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the city.\n\n16:25 Wives in Saudi Arabia are allowed to refuse to have sex with their husbands if the men do not take precautions to protect themselves from the new coronavirus, a Muslim cleric in the conservative kingdom said.\n\n\"You are not a sinner at all...you are protecting yourself,\" Sheikh Abdullah Ahmed al-Mutlaq, a member of a senior scholars' authority said on a religious TV show. He was responding to a viewer's concern about catching coronavirus from her husband, who continues to go out publicly despite national restrictions, were she to give in to his desire to sleep with her.\n\n\"Immunize yourself and stay away from him. If a husband is careless, so the wife has the right to refrain from him,\" the cleric said.\n\nThe kingdom has reported 1,720 coronavirus infections and 16 fatalities. Around 93% of the country's 30 million inhabitants are Muslim.\n\n15:55 A worldwide food shortage could occur if the coronavirus crisis isn't handled properly, three global agencies warned on Wednesday.\n\n\"Uncertainty about food availability can spark a wave of export restrictions, creating a shortage on the global market,\" said a joint statement signed by Qu Dongyu, head of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roberto Azevedo, director of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nRead more: Will coronavirus spark a wave of food nationalism?\n\nGovernment lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus, which have closed national borders and kept workers at home, have created a significant lag in international food supply chains, while panic buying and hoarding has already left supermarket shelves bear in recent weeks.\n\n\"In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdowns, every effort must be made to ensure that trade flows as freely as possible, specially to avoid food shortage(s)\" from developing, the statement said.\n\n\"When acting to protect the health and well-being of their citizens, countries should ensure that any trade-related measures do not disrupt the food supply chain,\" it added.\n\nThe statement may have been directed at Moscow, where officials are considering restricting wheat exports from Russia to keep prices from spiking there.\n\n\"Such disruptions including hampering the movement of agricultural and food industry workers and extending border delays for food containers, result in the spoilage of perishables and increasing food waste,\" the statement said.\n\n15:50 Germany's Greens have voiced support for the development of a tracking app to monitor people infected with the coronavirus — albeit with certain restrictions.\n\nKonstantin von Notz, the internal affairs spokesperson for the Greens, told DW that the app currently being developed by German researchers would not be used to track people who are infected and would be used on a \"voluntary basis.\"\n\nWatch video 01:37 Germany aims to launch coronavirus tracing app\n\nThe app that currently being worked on by German researchers would monitor people who are infected with the virus, anonymously storing the data on the amount of time the person spent with others and to alert them that they should potentially get tested. Von Notz emphasized that the app would only save the contact data of others who have the app.\n\n\"That, if done correctly in a detailed way, is a data-efficient solution and an effective way of finding out who might have been potentially infected,\" von Notz said.\n\nHe warned, however, that the app would not be able to — and shouldn't be able to — let people know whether the person standing next to them in line at the grocery store is infected.\n\nRead more: Will Germans trade privacy for coronavirus protection?\n\nFollowing a phone conference with state leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also spoke in favor of tracking apps.\n\n\"It's clear that it would be on a voluntary basis, but if the testing of these apps shows them to be good and set to be successful in better tracing cases of where there has been contact, I'd certainly be in favor of recommending that to citizens,\" she said.\n\n\"I would of course also be prepared to use it myself to perhaps help other people,\" she added.\n\n1540 In Israel, the defense minister on Wednesday appeared to tie potential coronavirus aid for the Gaza Strip to an attempt to get back the remains of two Israeli soldiers who died in 2014.\n\nGaza, which currently has 12 reported cases of coronavirus, has just 96 ventilators for its population of 2 million. The impoverished Palestinian territory does not have the infrastructure to contain an outbreak.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett told reporters that it would \"not be right\" to disconnect aid for Gaza from Israel recovering the soldiers' remains.\n\n\"The moment there is talk of the humanitarian world in Gaza. Israel also has humanitarian needs, which are mainly the recovery of the fallen,\" Bennett of the soldiers whose remains are being held by Hamas, Gaza's Islamist governing authority.\n\nIt was unclear whether Bennett was referring to the possibility of Israel providing aid directly, or of the country allowing the transfer of aid over its borders.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum rejected the idea. \"Israel bears responsibility for any consequences should the disease spread in Gaza because it has been blockading it for 13 years,\" he said. \"A prisoner swap deal is a separate track.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli authorities are also considering a full lockdown for the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak, a crowded ultra-Orthodox suburb with around 730 known cases of coronavirus.\n\nThe suburb of 200,000 has the second-highest number of infections in the country after Jerusalem. The government fears that the ultra-Orthodox community is continuing to meet for large gatherings despite a ban on doing so. On Saturday, some 400 people attended a rabbi’s funeral. Over 1 million of Israel’s 9 million inhabitants are ultra-Orthodox Jews.\n\n15:05 The Wimbledon tennis tournament has been canceled for the first time since World War II, the All England Club said.\n\nFollowing an emergency meeting, officials said the oldest Grand Slam tournament in tennis would not be held in 2020. Wimbledon was scheduled to be played on the outskirts of London from June 29 to July 12.\n\n14:40 UEFA, European soccer's governing body, postponed international matches scheduled to be played in June. Other competitions, including the Champions League, are also on hold, UEFA announced.\n\n\"All national team matches for men and women due to be played in June 2020 are postponed until further notice. This includes the play-off matches for Euro 2020 and qualifying matches for the women's Euro 2021,\" a statement said. \"All other UEFA competition matches, including the centralized international friendly matches, remain postponed until further notice.\"\n\n13:55 In a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus, German state and federal leaders decided to extend restrictions prohibiting groups of people meeting in public until the end of the Easter holidays. During a phone conference, Chancellor Angela Merkel and state interior ministers agreed that social distancing rules will remain in place to stop people from meeting more than one other person outside of their own family or household, German media reported.\n\n\"A pandemic does not take a vacation,\" Merkel said following the call.\n\nCitizens \"are urged to keep contact with people beyond their own household to an absolute minimum, even during the Easter holidays, in accordance with the applicable rules,\" Focus Online and the German dpa news agency cited a draft resolution for the telephone conference as saying.\n\n13:30 The United Kingdom recorded over 500 daily coronavirus deaths for the first time, the British government announced on Wednesday. Officials logged 563 new deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 fatalities to 3,352. As of Wednesday morning, the number of confirmed cases rose to 29,474.\n\nPrince Charles has recovered after testing positive for coronavirus. His office said he was now in good health.\n\nThe 71-year-old heir to the British throne said he finds himself \"in no less a state of social distance and general isolation.\"\n\nCharles went into self-isolation last week and came out on Monday after experiencing what he said were \"luckily … relatively mild symptoms.\"\n\nCharles applauded the commitment of health care workers fighting the virus and praised the work of charities supporting the elderly during the coronavirus crisis.\n\n13:20 Adidas has apologized for saying it would stop paying rent for stores in Europe that have been closed due to coronavirus prevention measures. The company said it would pay rent in April after facing a wave of backlash, including calls for a boycott, over its earlier decision.\n\n\"Almost all over the world, there is no normal business anymore. The shops are closed. Even a healthy company like Adidas cannot stand this for long,\" Adidas said in an open letter sent to several media outlets.\n\nThe German sportswear giant said it understood criticism levied against it from customers and politicians alike.\n\n\"We would, therefore, like to apologize to you formally. We have paid our landlords the rent for April,\" Adidas said.\n\n13:13 In France, the death toll rose to over 4,000 with many of those who died coming from the eastern region of Grand Est, along the border with Germany. Regional health authorities said 1,015 people have died in France after contracting COVID-19 in Grand Est. To relieve pressure on hospitals in the region, some patients have already been transferred to hospitals in Germany, Luxemburg and Switzerland.\n\nA pair of trains carried some 36 patients from Paris to western France on Wednesday. It was the first time that high-speed trains brought patients out of the French capital.\n\nFrench public health officials said the total confirmed number of coronavirus infection in France reached 56,989. A total of 4,032 people have died of the virus in France. The total makes France the fourth country to report more than 4,000 coronavirus deaths after Italy, Spain and the United States.\n\nThe French Interior Ministry has handed out nearly 360,000 fines to people who have been caught violating the country's strict lockdown measures.\n\n13:10 Switzerland's Health Ministry announced on Wednesday that its national death toll from the coronavirus reached 378, rising from 373 a day earlier. The number of confirmed infections also increased to 17,139 from 16,176 on Tuesday.\n\nThe Swiss government is in the process of expanding its emergency liquidity scheme for businesses hit by the effects of the coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile, banks have already distributed more than half of the 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.7 billion, €18.3 billion) put-aside for state-backed loans.\n\n12:52 Senegal has reported its first coronavirus-related death. Pape Diouf, the former president of French soccer club Marseille and a former sports journalist, died at the age of 68 after contracting the virus, the country's Health Ministry announced.\n\nDiouf, who was president of the Marseille club from 2005-09, had been treated since Saturday in an intensive care unit of a Dakar hospital.\n\n\"I pay tribute to this great figure in sport,\" Senegalese President Macky Sall tweeted.\n\nFamily members said Diouf was meant to be moved to France. He had recently traveled to a number of countries throughout West Africa.\n\nSenegal has registered 190 cases of the coronavirus, with 45 of those having recovered.\n\n12:36 European Union: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a short-term work scheme modeled on a similar German program to support EU citizens keep their jobs as the coronavirus pandemic takes a blow on economies across the bloc.\n\nVon der Leyen made the announcement via video message but did not give details on how the scheme would be funded.

Eleven of the victims were frontline doctors. Infections have more than doubled over the same period to 1,677. Experts fear figures of coronavirus cases are much higher, as testing rates are low.\n\nAn 11-year-old girl has become the country's youngest person to die after contracting the coronavirus, officials said. The girl was also suffering from dengue fever and died a day after being admitted to hospital on March 19. Tests only confirmed this week that the child also had COVID-19.\n\n11:55 The Philippines has recorded 227 new coronavirus cases and eight more deaths, the country's Health Ministry said, bringing the total number of infections and deaths to 2,311 and 96, respectively.\n\nResidents of a slum area in the capital Manila staged a protest, demanding basic emergency relief goods such as food amid a month-long lockdown that has left many of them without work. Police arrested 20 of the protesters after they refused to go back to their homes.\n\n11:07 Russia President Vladimir Putin will hold a government meeting later today by video conference, a day after a doctor who met with Putin last week said he had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin's health is fine, but that he is choosing to keep his distance from other people and preferred to work remotely.\n\nThe doctor, Denis Protsenko, had given Putin a tour of Moscow's main coronavirus hospital in Moscow and shook the leader's hand.\n\n10:50 Here's an overview of the latest numbers from some of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic:\n\nIn Iran, the death toll from the virus reached 3,036, with 138 deaths in the past 24 hours, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV. He said the country had 47,593 infected cases — 2,987 of which had been declared in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe United States is now the country with by far the highest number of COVID-19 cases — a total of 189,633 — according to the Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The figures include 4,081 fatalities, around a quarter of which are in New York City.\n\nSecond-most affected is Italy, which has 105,792 cases of infection, according to the JHU tally. It thus far has a much higher death rate, with 12,428 fatalities.\n\nGlobally, there have been 873,767 infection cases and 43,228 deaths as a result of the pandemic.\n\n10:33 In an interview with DW, Jan Egeland, Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said refugee camps require global solidarity to tackle coronavirus, stressing that as long as the virus can spread to the more vulnerable, the coronavirus pandemic can never be dealt with.\n\nWatch video 01:10 Egeland: 'We're overwhelmed, we're overstretched'\n\nEgeland warned that the highly contagious virus poses a significant threat to refugees, as the virus can thrive in congested camps and settlements. He said the NRC is working to provide more handwashing facilities, more water and sanitation to camps in Afghanistan, in Iran and in 30 other countries.\n\n\"We're overwhelmed, overstretched … There must be more injection of humanitarian aid,\" Egeland said.\n\nThe non-governmental organization is also trying to provide more space for refugees so they have physical distance from each other.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: Urgent appeal for evacuation of Greek refugee camps\n\nWatch video 01:44 Share Coronavirus looms over Lesbos refugee camp Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3aBCr Coronavirus catastrophe looms over Lesbos refugee camp\n\n10:15 Japan is on the brink of crisis, with medical experts particularly worried about preparations for an upsurge in coronavirus cases in Tokyo, officials say.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that controlling the virus was a top priority. He said the Japanese government would do \"whatever is needed.\"\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has shied away from declaring a state of emergency. Even if it were declared, he said, it would not mean he could order an immediate nationwide lockdown of cities, such as in France. Any emergency declaration would allow prefectural governors to make necessary requests and give orders, he said.\n\nAbe said that even if Japan could avoid an explosive spread of the coronavirus, the country was expected to \"remain on the brink for a long time.\"\n\nJapan has some 2,229 COVID-19 cases and 57 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University — far lower than numbers from the United States, Europe and China. However, new infections continue to set fresh daily records.\n\nRead more: Tokyo 2020 postponement poses Herculean financial challenge\n\n09:52 The number of coronavirus infections in Spain has risen to 102,136, the Health Ministry announced Wednesday.

A mask must be provided to shoppers upon entry; alternatively, customers will be allowed to wear their own mask.\n\nThe biggest challenge for stores would be sourcing the up to 4 million masks per day, Rainer Will, head of the country's trade association, told Austrian public broadcaster ORF.\n\nA spokesperson for the grocery store chain Spar called on customers in Austria to stagger their store-visiting times, Bavarian broadcaster BR24 reported.\n\nFace masks are in short global supply, with reports of frontline medical workers in some countries being told to share face masks and other protective gear.\n\nPamela Fidler-Stolz, reporting for Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung, was handed a mask on entry at her local supermarket and said it was very straight-forward: \"It was very relaxed and there was enough masks: One store worker controlled the entry of customers, and asked each person to take a mask out the stand on entry.\"\n\n07:56 The UK is aiming to increase the number of tests for coronavirus to 25,000 a day by the middle of April from its current capacity of 12,750 a day, Housing Minister Robert Jenrick told Sky News on Wednesday.\n\nThe UK is beginning to test medical staff in addition to patients in hospitals. According to Jenrick, 8,240 individuals were tested on Monday and more than 900 health workers were tested over the weekend.\n\nThere are currently 25,481 positive cases in the UK, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nGuidelines for coronavirus testing vary from country to country. Countries where testing is only being done on patients with severe symptoms are believed to have a larger number of unknown cases.\n\nSouth Korea took the lead in widespread coronavirus testing, and many attribute Germany's broad testing to the country's low fatality rate. Virologist Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the coronavirus at Berlin's Charite hospital, has estimated that Germany is now capable of carrying out 500,000 coronavirus tests a week.\n\nRead more: Is comparing coronavirus death rates futile?\n\n07:39 Colombia confirmed its first coronavirus cases among the country's indigenous people, Reuters reported, citing local authorities.

It has already barred individuals from entering the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nUp to 2 million Muslims perform the yearly pilgrimage, one of the central pillars of Islam. Canceling the hajj would be unprecedented in modern times, but limiting attendance from high-risk areas has happened before, such as during the Ebola outbreak.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Millions of Muslim Pilgrims The hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the most holy city for Muslims. All Muslims are expected to perform this religious duty at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially able. It is one of the five pillars of Islam, or core ritual practices, and considered to be the largest gathering of people in the world, with millions attending every year.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Following the prophet As many as three million pilgrims perform a series of rituals over the course of five or six days. First, they stop to pray at the Grand Mosque, home to a cubic building draped in black silk called the Kaaba, Islam’s most important shrine.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Stoning the devil Pilgrims travel to the village of Mina to again pray and read from the Quran. Next they spend a day at Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed gave his final sermon, to ask for forgiveness. On their return journey to Mecca, the pilgrims stop on a plain called Muzdalifah to collect stones, which they will throw at three pillars in Mina to symbolically stone the devil.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Circling Kaaba Finally, upon returning to Mecca, the pilgrims will circle the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque seven times, bringing their hajj to a close. They then shave their heads and perform an animal sacrifice before celebrating the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Tragedy during hajj Since 1987, more than 5,800 people have died in building collapses, stampedes, trampling and fires. In 2015, a stampede resulted in around 2,400 deaths, making it the worst catastrophe in the history of hajj. The pilgrimage is also a hotbed of infectious disease, as pilgrims from every corner of the planet often trek around in the heat barefoot and share tight sleeping quarters.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Bringing the new to the old While the hajj is the oldest and most sacred ritual of Islam, it has also been brought into the 21st Century. The Saudi government is using the latest in crowd-control techniques to prevent trampling and architectural collapses. On YouTube, they telecast live hajj and now, Google, iTunes and other sites have come out with hajj apps to help pilgrims better understand and perform the hajj rituals.\n\n\n\n06:45 Taiwan has said it will donate 10 million masks to the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe island, which is the world's second-largest mask producer, will send 7 million masks to 11 European countries including Italy, Spain and Germany.\n\nThe United States will receive 2 million masks, Germany's DPA news agency reported, with a further 1 million masks to be sent to the 15 countries with which Taiwan has diplomatic relations.\n\nTaiwan soon expects to be able to make 15 million surgical masks a day.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center said there had been 322 total cases of COVID-19 on the island, including five deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, President Tsai Ing-wen announced a financial stimulus valuing some $35 billion (€31 billion) to cushion the impact of the coronavirus on the Taiwanese economy.\n\nRead more: How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?\n\nWatch video 03:10 Is the virus under control in China and Taiwan? – DW's Phoebe Kong reports\n\n06:23 China's National Health Commission says it has recorded 36 new cases of the COVID-19 disease in one day, after announcing that asymptomatic cases would be included in the official count from now on. It did not say if any of the new cases was asymptomatic.\n\nThe commission said all but one of the new cases was imported from abroad. It also added that there had been seven more deaths from the disease in the past 24 hours.\n\nChina’s National Health Commission has reported 1,367 asymptomatic cases under observation as of Tuesday. The country announced earlier on Wednesday that is was extending screening to asymptomatic cases and the people with whom they have been in contact.\n\nThe data comes amid scrutiny of figures reported by the Chinese authorities, which previously only included those people who exhibited symptoms. The proportion of people who have contracted the virus but remain asymptomatic is currently unknown, but experts have estimated it could be as high as 30%. According to scientists, these carriers can still pass COVID-19 onto others who do become sick.\n\nWhile China's domestic outbreak has largely subsided, questions have arisen over whether the country's failure to count asymptomatic cases would lead to a resurgence of infections.\n\nChina, where the novel coronavirus was first detected in December, has recorded a total of 81,554 cases of COVID-19 and 3,312 deaths from the disease.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: China's Wuhan prepares for the uncertain end of COVID-19\n\n05:47 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the coronavirus pandemic amounted to humanity's worst crisis since World War II, with the outbreak threatening people in every country.\n\nGuterres said the disease and measures taken against it would likely bring about a recession \"that probably has no parallel in the recent past.\"\n\nThe effect of both the disease and its economic impact will contribute to \"enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict,\" the UN chief said at the launch on Tuesday of a report into the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19.\n\n\"We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the United Nations — one that is killing people, spreading human suffering, and upending people's lives,\" the report said.\n\n\"This is much more than a health crisis. It is a human crisis. The coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core.\"\n\nEarlier, Guterres announced a new trust fund that would help some countries respond to the emergency and recover from its effects at a social and economic level.\n\n05:40 German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to meet state premiers from across Germany on Wednesday to discuss the effect that anti-coronavirus measures are having.\n\nGermany introduced strict contact restrictions about 10 days ago, banning meetings between more than two people not from the same household outside of the workplace.\n\nIt is expected that the latest discussions will include a debate over an obligation to wear masks in public places. Austria announced such a measure on Monday, triggering discussions in Germany. Some municipalities in the eastern state of Thuringia have already issued decrees for masks to be mandatory in supermarkets, buses and trains.\n\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn on Tuesday said he was against making it obligatory for protective masks to be worn.\n\nWatch video 01:53 Share Are face masks effective?

This makes it the country with the fifth-highest level of infection in the world, although this has been partly attributed to the widespread testing being carried out in the country. The university data also shows a total of 775 deaths as a result of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), put the death toll in the country at 732 as of early Wednesday and the total number of infection cases at 67,366. The RKI sometimes has a slight time lag in updating its data because it collates figures submitted by regional and local authorities.\n\nThe agency's data showed infections had increased by 5,453 compared with the previous day, while the death toll had experienced a sharp rise of 149.\n\n04:29 The death toll in the US from the novel coronavirus pandemic has reached 4,076 — double the number from three days prior, the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland reported. The total number of infections has reached 189,510 nationwide, according to the same statistics. Experts have predicted that up to 240,000 individuals in the US could die as a result of the outbreak.\n\n03:51 In sharp change from his usual tone on the coronavirus pandemic, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro acknowledged the danger posed by the outbreak. \"The virus is a reality,\" he said in a televised speech on Tuesday. \"We are standing in front of one of the greatest challenges of our generation.\"\n\nPreviously, Bolsonaro dismissed the virus as a \"little flu,\" criticized lockdowns imposed by local authorities, and flaunted social distancing recommendations from his own government by meeting groups of his supporters. He also repeatedly urged Brazilians to return to work.\n\nIn the Tuesday speech, Bolsonaro once again voiced his concerns over the economy and warned that the cure against the outbreak cannot be worse than the pandemic itself.\n\n03:33 Taiwan's government will provide an economic stimulus of over $1 trillion, (€907 billion) to mitigate coronavirus fallout, said President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday.\n\nRead more: How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?\n\n03:27 German police believe anti-pandemic isolation measures are causing a rise in domestic violence.

They would be followed by prisoners with less than 60 days remaining of their term.\n\n\"We do not take these new measures lightly,\" CDCR Secretary Ralph Diaz said in a statement. \"However, in the face of a global pandemic, we must consider the risk of COVID-19 infection as a grave threat to safety, too.\"\n\n03:14 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier joined several heads of state to urge a \"new global alliance\" against the coronavirus in a letter published by the Financial Times on Wednesday.\n\n\"This pandemic will not spare any country, no matter how advanced its economy, capabilities, or technology,\" the leaders said in a letter also signed by Singapore's President Halimah Yacob, Ethiopia's Sahle-Work Zewde, Ecuador's Lenin Moreno, as well as Jordan's King Abdullah II.\n\n\"This is a global crisis,\" the letter states. \"Delay in action means death.\" Among other measures, the heads of state called for boosting research into treatments and vaccines, and \"fair and equitable\" distribution of medical equipment ant testing kits. \"A global solution is in everybody's self-interest,\" they said.\n\n03:00 Germany's Bayreuth Festival, the annual opera event honoring composer Richard Wagner, has been canceled due to the coronavirus.\n\nThe popular music festival had been set to start in late July and last until late August.

Ireland's famous March 17 parades were also previously cancelled in 2001 during an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Vatican museums With quarantine measures in place in northern Italy, soccer matches occurring without spectators, and Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte's order to close museums, theaters and cinemas, it should come as no surprise that the Vatican has closed the doors to its museums, including the Sistine Chapel (above), until probably April 3. In the Vatican itself, five people are currently in quarantine.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled South by Southwest (SXSW) This annual music, film and tech festival held in Austin, Texas, usually attracts more than 400,000 visitors.

It's the first Hollywood blockbuster to shift its release schedule in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Venice Architecture Biennale The start of the world's most prestigious architecture biennale has also been delayed.

US officials cited by the Reuters news agency said that nearly 80 people aboard the nuclear-powered warship had tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he had not read the letter in detail, but added it was not the time to evacuate the ship. \"I don't think we're at that point,\" he told CNN.\n\n00:30 US President Donald Trump hinted at expanding travel restrictions on Tuesday, saying that he was \"absolutely\" considering a ban on Brazil and several other countries.\n\nIn February and March, the US administration introduced bans on travelers from China and virtually all western European countries in a bid to curb the spread COVID-19.
