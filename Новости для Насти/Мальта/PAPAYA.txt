Stomach bloating: Four drinks proven to help beat the bloat
According to TV doctor Dr Oz: “A 2009 study showed that raw papaya contains a white, milky substance called papain and when ripe, the fruit is moderately laxative and helps in the movement of the bowels.”
He added: “Although it is not the most popular or readily available fruit, papaya may be worth considering. Try using fresh papaya slices in a breakfast smoothie.”
Furthermore, medical website LiveStrong suggests papain may to help reduce gas in people who don't produce enough of the enzymes necessary for breaking down proteins in the digestive tract.
It said: “It contains an enzyme called papain that can improve digestion by helping to break down proteins.”

Papain is a powerful digestive enzyme commonly found and extracted from the papaya fruit (Carica papaya), it is also referred to as papaya proteinase. The papaya-enzyme papain plays a key role in digestive processes involving breaking down tough protein fibers. For this reason, it has been commonly used in its native South America as a digestive support for meat eating.

The global digital assets management market size was USD 2,220.00 Million in 2018 and is expected to grow to USD 10,206.20 Million in 2025 with a CAGR 24.35%. Media consumption across the globe is increasingly happening in digital formats. The increase in the number of devices capable of supporting digital media along with increasing internet access speed has provided consumers with an option to access the media content of his choice be it information, entertainment or social activity anytime, anywhere.
A study conducted by Adobe indicated that the increase in smartphone usage is directly influencing consumer content consumption habits. In December 2018, Adobe conducted Consumer Content Survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers, who own at least one digital device and found that digital content consumption is on the rise and consumers have already established expectations and preferences. The proliferation of various content formats (i.e., video, social, memes, etc.) is behind the growth in digital content consumption. According to the Adobe Consumer Content Survey, consumers spend 8.8 hours a day, on average, engaging with digital content.
Nowadays, the rise of digital media players such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple TV, Roku, and Boxee, etc. are changing consumer’s expectations around customer’s experience. The bar is getting higher for high-quality digital content and consumers have little patience for the poor experience. With consumers now using multiple devices throughout the day, people expect the experience and level of personalization will be continuous and seamless as they move from one device to the next.

Consumers in India can finally get their hands on the OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren Edition, which has been 'crafted' in collaboration with British car maker McLaren. While the phone is slated to go on open sale on November 5, you can now grab the phone from Amazon.in as part of a special "7T minutes" sale that begins at 12 PM IST.
The OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren Limited Edition is priced at ₹58,999 ($831) in India, making it the company's most expensive smartphone yet. In comparison, the "regular" OnePlus 7T Pro is priced at ₹53,999 ($761) in the country. In terms of hardware, the only key difference between the two is that the McLaren Edition comes with 12GB of RAM instead of 8GB on the OnePlus 7T Pro.
In the design department, the limited edition variant comes with Papaya Orange accents and a wood grain-like pattern on the rear panel. The pattern is said to be styled after the composite material McLaren uses in its cars. It also comes with a customized user-interface with custom icons, animations, papaya orange lighting effects, themes, and wallpapers.

APOPKA, Fla. - Six years ago, the Farmworker Association of Florida helped develop a way to help workers put food on the table. It's through community gardens that many farmworkers are growing the same produce they pick on the fields.
"It's a little bit paradoxical, but farmworkers don't have access to fresh fruits and vegetables," said Antonio Tovar, interim coordinator of Farm Worker Association of Florida.
The organization advocates for farm workers and helps them get access to land so they can harvest their own foods.
"The salary is very low or they work on mono crops -- like, just oranges or just tomatoes -- so they need to buy other produce, and they decided to create community gardens so they can raise their own food," Tovar said.
Currently, there are four gardens located in Homestead, Pierson, Fellsmere and Apopka. There they grow dozens of herbs such as cilantro, sage, rosemary, thyme and basil.
According to the association, many farm workers can't afford supermarket prices. By having a garden, they get to harvest fruits and vegetables without chemicals and it's within their budget.
"Particularly industrial agriculture is not giving a good treatment to their workers and is also contaminating the lands where they're located, (so) it's not possible to have actual food for the people who work the land," said Paola Sarmiento, co-coordinator of the Agroecology Project.
The garden project was initially funded by the Kellog Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but they no longer receive those grants.
"Right now, we don't have any funding, so we're basically working with volunteers, with community garden members like farm workers," Sarmiento said. "We have been using the actual sustainability idea to start selling in our communities the herbs that we produce."
The gardens are also allowing them to grow their traditional foods such as plantains, papaya, yucca and hibiscus.
Several of these farm workers are of Mexican, Central American and African backgrounds -- communities with few rights, according to Tovar.
"They are not compensated for over time. Sometimes they don't have breaks to go to the bathroom or drink water and actually there are no regulations in terms of how many breaks they can take. They are the people who bring the food to our tables and I think that these people have been ignored for many, many years, so they deserve a better life and better living conditions," Tovar said.
The lands that hold the gardens are loaned to Farm Worker Association of Florida for a small rate from the cities or community centers to support them. The association set up a GoFundMe page for community members to make a donations that will go toward the sustainability and maintenance
of their gardens. The association is also on Facebook.

Cannucce di plastica: perché non si riciclano
Il problema delle cannucce di plastica è che non si possono riciclare. Sono fatte dello stesso materiale di bottiglie e stoviglie monouso, il Polipropilene, ma non sono considerate imballaggio. Quindi, a differenza delle bottiglie, non vanno nella frazione della plastica. Banno conferite come secco residuo, senza possibilità di tornare a nuova vita.
Il motivo sta nella loro forma e nella leggerezza del prodotto. Ciò le rende difficili da raccogliere sui nastri degli impianti di smaltimento e riciclo della plastica, che hanno ancora qualche problema con gli oggetti di piccole dimensioni.
Cannucce di plastica: tutte le alternative
Mentre pensiamo, meditabondi, sul disastro ambientale in cui ci siamo cacciati a forza di succhiare Spritz con le nostre cannucce di plastica nere, c’è chi studia delle alternative.
Stelo di foglia di papaya
Lo stelo di foglia di papaya rappresenta una perfetta cannuccia naturale. È perfetta per bere l’acqua di cocco o da abbinare a succhi e cocktail tropicali. Lo stelo è cavo, quindi basta staccarlo dal tronco, pulirlo sulle estremità e frazionarlo. Infatti è molto lungo e può dar vita a tante cannucce completamente biodegradabili.
Bambù
Il bambù è una pianta che cresce molto velocemente. In Asia è molto diffuso. Da questo vegetale possiamo ricavare delle cannucce perfette per succhi di frutta. L’azienda Bambaw ha commercializzato cannucce in bambù capaci di resistere ai lavaggi in lavastoviglie. Le piante da cui è stato preso il bambù sono coltivate a Bali e danno vita anche a spazzolini da denti ecologici. Una volta che questi prodotti si consumano, basta buttarli nella frazione organica. In un paio di mesi si decomporranno.
Vetro
A differenza di quelle in bambù o di metallo, il barista pignolo può vedere facilmente se queste cannucce riutilizzabili sono sporche o no. Le cannucce in vetro sono disponibili in ogni ordine di lunghezza, diametro e colore. Le migliori sono quelle in vetro borosilicato, l’equivalente del Pyrex.
Acciaio inossidabile
Le cannucce di acciaio inossidabile sono considerata le migliore alternativa alla plastica da molti bartender per cocktail di lunga durata. Per i più esigenti esistono in commercio anche quelle in titanio e argento sterling.
Carta
Le cannucce di carta sono quelle oggi più diffuse. Compostabili, biodegradabili, provenienti da fonti rinnovabili e spesso coloratissime, non si sfaldano al primo sorso. Al contrario di ciò che si può pensare, durano fino a tre ore immerse in un cocktail freddo. Si piegano, certo. Ma mentre lo fanno, assolvono alla loro funzione.
La cannuccia di grano
In origine le prime cannucce venivano realizzate dall’essiccazione dello stelo della spiga di grano. Molte aziende stanno lavorando per riportare in vita questa soluzione completamente biodegradabile. Straw By Straw è tra queste. Le sue cannucce sono coltivate biologicamente e si presentano come perfetto accompagnamento di drink retrò.
Plastica biodegradabile
Numerose startup sono al lavoro per creare la perfetta plastica biodegradabile, come EarthBi. Ma ancora oggi molti dei materiali in commercio, basati per lo più sull’acido polilattico (PLA), si degradano velocemente solo in certe condizioni. Ma non è sempre possibile avere alte temperature per decomporre un po’ di cannucce.
Inoltre, la bioplastica non può essere conferita nella normale frazione della plastica, perché rischia di rovinare il materiale tradizionale nella fase di riciclo. Questo significa che persino questa alternativa ecologica, tanto bene all’ambiente non fa. Le cannucce in bioplastica rischiano infatti di vagare per decenni nel pianeta, interferendo con l’ecosistema. Proprio come la plastica tradizionale.
Cannucce commestibili
Questa è l’alternativa più divertente perché ha spinto i mixologyst a scervellarsi sulla scoperta di un dispositivo cavo, tubolare e commestibile per il consumo dei propri drink. La startup Loliware ha lanciato su Kickstarter la propria campagna di crowdfunding, presentando due tipi di cannucce: quelle commestibili ma senza sapore, e quelle aromatizzate da abbinare ai vari drink.
Cannucce commestibili: i bucatini
Tra le cannucce commestibili si piazzano i bucatini. Sì, proprio quelli utilizzati per l’amatriciana o la carbonara. Se il condotto è troppo stretto, basta scegliere dei più comodi ziti o zitoni. È la scelta della startup Stroodles. Il vantaggio è che queste cannucce alternative non subiranno alcuna trasformazione se immerse in liquidi freddi per molto tempo.
L’alternativa definitiva: nessuna cannuccia
Non prendiamoci in giro: le cannucce sostenibili costano di più di quelle usa e getta in plastica tradizionale. Il fattore prezzo potrebbe scoraggiare qualcuno, ma c’è un’alternativa ancora più economica a quelle elencate: rinunciare alla cannuccia nel drink. Altrimenti la si può offrire a richiesta e a pagamento: scoprirete che in molti non la desiderano nemmeno.

Ricky Gervais as Tony in Netflix series 'After Life' sitting in front of a fake Aboriginal artwork. (Netflix)
The main character in the British comedian's new TV series is seen frequently with the dot-painting in his living room.
The production company behind a hit Netflix series will pay compensation for using an unauthorised reproduction of a painting by a Papunya Tula artist.
Derek Productions, the British company behind Ricky Gervais’ hit After Life series has agreed to pay a fee for the use of a work titled Tingarri Dreaming by well known Western Desert artist Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri.
The copyright protected work is part of the Castan donation held in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV).
Copyright Agency, the not-for-profit that works on behalf of visual artists to ensure appropriate licensing agreements for the use of copyright material, facilitated the agreement.
The agency has secured a retrospective licence for the use of a reproduction of the artists' original work on the first series of the Netflix hit and has licensed a high-quality, authorised copy of the original painting for the second series, due to be released in 2020.
The NGV will supply the high resolution photograph of the original work for the creation of the authorised copy.
A spokesperson for Mr Tjapaltjarri said the Papunya Tula Artists group was pleased with the outcome.
“It’s important that his work and the work of all Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists is acknowledged and respected,” said Paul Sweeny, the general manager for Papunya Tula Artists.
Ricky Gervais' fake Aboriginal art is not a prop, it's cultural theft OPINION: Bundjalung artist, Ella Noah Bancroft explains the damaging impact when fake Aboriginal art stars on the set of the latest Netflix drama 'After Life'.
The unauthorised use of a copied image of the work on the first series of the show was first identified by NITV's Danny Teece-Johnson in March.
It was also criticised in an opinion piece by Bundjalung artist Ella Noah Bancroft.
"If Ricky Gervais and his production team really wanted to have an Aboriginal Dot paintings as props, would it not seem like an ethical thing to actually purchase from a community and showcase an Aboriginal artist?" she wrote.

Avete mai pensato alla papaya verde come alleata contro i segni del tempo? Ebbene si oltre ad essere molto gustosa cura la bellezza della pelle.
Quando parliamo di papaya verde pensiamo subito ad un alimento. Non a caso nei paesi tropicali è considerato un componente importante nella dieta quotidiana. Famosi sono anche i suoi utilizzi come frutto o come ingrediente di succhi di frutta e sciroppi.
Della papaya non si butta via nulla. Si possono infatti consumare sia le foglie che i frutti. Questi ultimi, in particolare, si possono mangiare sia acerbi che maturi, cotti, crudi o essiccati. In Thailandia, inoltre, è l’ingrediente cardine di prodotti cosmetici anti age.
Come ottenere l’effetto anti age
Per ottenere una pelle dall’aspetto bello, giovane e sano possiamo usare la papaya in tanti modi. Non solo quindi a livello puramente cosmetico ma anche integrandola nell’alimentazione quotidiana. Vediamo come.
-Insalata: Si consiglia di consumarla una volta a settimana. Ciò, infatti, consente di ripulire la pelle dall’interno così come l’intestino. Se consumata prima dei pasti migliora la qualità dell’epidermide oltre a prevenire l’ossidazione del colesterolo. Basta tagliare a julienne la polpa di una fetta del frutto e privarla dei semi. La si può abbinare a qualsiasi altra verdura.
–Polvere di papaya: La papaya fermentata è consigliata quando si ha la pelle del viso particolarmente spenta. Per un mese una bustina di papaya fermentata in polvere sciolta in un bicchiere di acqua a temperatura ambiente da assumere la mattina prima di colazione. Aiuta a combattere lo stress ossidativo e promuove il ricambio cellulare.
–Enzima di papaina: Lo troviamo nella polpa della papaia verde. Se ne consiglia l’uso sotto forma di impacco due volte alla settimana. Ciò si rivela particolarmente utile per combattere il grigiore invernale della pelle. Basta sbucciare e frullare con dello yogurt naturale il frutto. Applicare la maschera alla sera sul viso evitando la zona occhi. Lasciare in posa per 15 minuti.
–Cocco: Mix di papaya verde e olio cocco per prevenire le couperose. Da applicare al mattino sul viso sul viso pulito tamponato. Massaggiare il prodotto sulla zona e lasciare agire per cinque minuti. I suoi acidi grassi a media catena proteggono la pelle dallo stress e dal clima.
Le proprietà della papaya
Le proprietà di cui gode la papaya derivano dalle sostanze di cui è composta. Scopriamo subito in quali casi si rivela un alleato numero uno.
–Proprietà antitumorali: La papaya è un frutto ricco di carotenoidi e polifenoli che gli conferiscono un potente effetto antiossidante. Quest’ultimo, in particolare, va a contrastare con successo l’insorgenza di radicali liberi.
–Sistema immunitario: L’assunzione della papaya aiuta a rinforzare il nostro sistema immunitario grazie alla presenza di vitamina C (più di 70 mg per ogni 100 grammi di polpa). A ciò si aggiungono, in forma più moderata, una buona quantità di altre vitamine. Tra queste il folato (Bg).

–Vista: La presenza del licopene, il carotenoide responsabile della colorazione rossa è ottimo per il mantenimento in buona salute della pelle e della vista. Ciò nonostante non sia considerato un nutriente essenziale.
–Diabete: La papaya viene consigliato nei paesi tropicali per tenere sotto controllo il diabete e aiutare la digestione ma anche per combattere i problemi di pelle secca e capelli deboli.
La papaya verde ma non solo si caratterizza, quindi, come un alleato non solo della nostra bellezza contro i segni del tempo ma anche del benessere a tutto tondo del nostro organismo.

One of the small things that separates baby boomers from younger generations is an irrational hatred for Halloween. “It’s American!” “It’s cultural imperialism!” “It celebrates the occult!” “It encourages small children to ask strangers for lollies!” (they may have a point on the last one). In response, I try to point out that many traditions, which were once foreign, become localised through the passage of time and small adaptations, and Australian culture is all the richer for it.
Share your worst Halloween pumpkin carvings Read more
It was in this spirit of adaptation that in recent years, I’ve begun to carve fruit rather than pumpkins. It’s also because, like most dads, I am a natural tightarse. In North America, pumpkins are cheap and plentiful in October. In Australia, farmers need to use special tricks to force them to grow outside their normal season, so they’re not cheap at all and you can’t even eat the insides (seeds don’t count). When you are forced to pay $15 for a 5kg inedible pumpkin, it’s a bad equation.
There are some squashes and pumpkins that are in season in Australia in October, like the Queensland blue, but they’re just not as good for carving as the classic giant Atlantic pumpkin. Butternut pumpkins, which are also in season right now, are almost impossible to cut open, let alone carve.
Interesting enough, the pumpkin was not even the first thing to be carved. Halloween has its origins in the Celtic traditions of Britain and Ireland, according to Carole Cusack, professor of religious studies at the University of Sydney, and until the discovery of the New World, they didn’t have pumpkins.
“They mostly carved small things, like turnips,” Cusack says. In fact, the origin story of the jack-o’-lantern is a Christian morality tale of a man called Jack who, to cut a long story short, cheats the devil numerous times but ends up doomed to walk the Earth in the afterlife with a turnip lit by a hot coal, cast out of hell by the devil.

Pumpkins only came on the scene after the Halloween tradition was brought to America. “Turnips are a lot harder to carve than pumpkins because they’re very hard and not hollow,” Cusack says.
So with the pumpkin itself an adaptation, there’s no need to stick to an impractical, American tradition. How do the alternatives fare?
Pineapple
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Scary and delicious – a carved pineapple for Halloween.
The pineapple I bought was $4 – this was at Harris Farm so check out Aldi or your local grocers for a cheaper one. You need to get the ones that still have tops (technically called a crown) for full effect. Cut off the top, use a knife to cut out the flesh and a spoon to scrape it out, then carve a face in there. Its flesh is delicious … try walking around saying that in a creepy Halloween voice.
Verdict: Scary and easy! 10/10
Rockmelon
Facebook Twitter Pinterest A rockmelon carved like a jack-o’-lantern bears more than a passing resemblance to George Costanza.
Everyone likes eating rockmelon. They’re also easy to carve and cheap at $2 each (Harris Farm) but they lack some of the pizazz of the pineapple and end up looking like George Costanza if he were a jack-o’-lantern.
Verdict: Not quite a rockstar. 6/10
Papaya
Facebook Twitter Pinterest A carved papaya glows through its skin when you place a candle inside it.
$4 for a large one. Papayas are like U2, a lot of people hate them for reasons I don’t quite understand. Even if you don’t like eating the insides, the strength of a papaya is that it’s really easy to carve out being both soft and firm. It also looks cool once lit up because the skin is semi-translucent and glows from the candlelight. You need to buy a decent-sized one to have room to fit the candle.
Verdict: Eerie and excellent. 8/10
Coconuts
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Only try this if you are comfortable with power tools.
$3 each. This carving is inspired by the Kakamora in the Disney film Moana. The film based the Kakamora on the mythical Solomon Islands creatures but took a few artistic liberties along the way, so there’s a chance these might end up in the problematic basket at some point – the film also had a mixed reception among Polynesian communities. They’re not easy to make because coconut shells are impossible to carve. Only try this if you are comfortable with power tools. If you want to take the risk, take a drill-mounted circular saw, clamp the coconut down on a workbench and drill out the eyes, perhaps a pair of nostrils. Then saw the top of the coconut off. I found a stiff box saw was best. Then grab your hot glue gun and stick on the other accoutrements like hands, legs and teeth. Power tools, children and cultural appropriation might not be the best mix, on reflection.

Verdict: Halloween cancelled. 2/10
Watermelon
I have used whole watermelons in previous years but this year I was looking at paying $25 for an 8kg one, which was the smallest I could find. In years past I have found it at Aldi for 99c a kilo. Watermelon is a childhood favourite, so it’s great if you’re hosting an after-school Halloween party. It’s easy to hollow out and carve and looks pretty good lit up at night. The only downside is that it doesn’t last well in the heat – the skin tends to melt, another problem which they don’t seem to have in most of North America at this time of year.
Verdict: big and beautiful, like a Trump wall. 7/10

Australian skincare export brand G&M Cosmetics has acquired P’URE Papaya Care skincare in a move which will help increase G&M’s footprint in both local and export retail markets.

Zvonko Jordanov, managing director and founder of G&M Cosmetics told Inside FMCG that the acquisition will complement G&M’s business and support customer calls for vegan and certified natural products.

“We looked for a business with complimentary distribution channels that could expand our current network and customer base. P’URE Papaya Care skincare range has strong distribution in Europe whereas G&M Cosmetics has a strong network within Asia,” Jordanov said.

“This partnership is going to help us both expand into different channels, locally and internationally. The P’URE Papaya skincare range contains complimentary products to our current portfolio, so this acquisition diversifies our growing product offering and will help increase our customer reach.”
The Sydney-based family beauty business has a presence in over 35,000 retail locations worldwide.
In the last decade it has seen a dramatic rise in exports especially into the Asian market. Its Australian Creams brand was voted the Most Trusted Australian Brand in China in the 2018 Australian Brands in China Index. The company’s products can be found in more than 30,000 retail outlets in China including Walmart China, Carrefour Supermarket, Vanguard Supermarket, Lotus Supermarket, Grandbuy, and Nepstar DrugStore Pharmacy.
“One of the points of difference and the key to G&M’s success in the export market has been that the focus on high grade, natural Australian ingredients such as Eucalyptus Oil, Lanolin, Emu oil, Macadamia Oil, Tea Tree Oil and Kakadu plum. Using these products at the front and centre of our packaging rather than focusing on our brand name has made a difference,” Jordanov said.

“As well as operating our own Tmall flagship online store, it is this mix of offline and online models that has been one of the key success in the China market.”
Over the last few years the company has also exported to markets in Asia like Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia and now entering Philippines and Indonesia.
“We are always looking to innovate our products and brand offering and tailor make them to suit the needs of our customers both locally and overseas,” Jordanov said.
G&M Cosmetics will manufacture P’URE Papaya Care skincare range in its own Sydney factory to maintain full control of the production process.

The inviting scent of frying onions makes its way into a quiet, sun-dappled clearing at Solitude Farm in Auroville.
A cook is rapidly tossing sliced onions and chillies in a wok. She works in a kitchen that is open on all sides. It spills into a café on the right, where an intern lines up boxes heavy with freshly harvested herbs for the community. As the cook shouts out that breakfast is ready, pouring steamy tea into a row of steel tumblers, farm workers slowly meander in for breakfast.
In the centre of it all, is Englishman-turned-Aurovillian Krishna Mckenzie, in a turban and lungi, giving his team precise, rapid-fire instructions in fluent Tamil. He spoons steaming varagu (kodo millet) into his bowl, topping it with a ladle of vegetable curry, between urging everyone to pause for breakfast. Then, he eats quickly, checking his cracked, clearly hard-working phone between spoonfuls.
There is a lot going on at Solitude these days. The café’s organic lunches are gaining popularity, as are the farm visits Krishna hosts on Saturdays. Their fruit and vegetable baskets go out three times a week to subscribers in Auroville and Puducherry. In a mission to educate people on the benefits of locally grown food, Solitude has also started hosting cooking classes, as well as workshops on permaculture.
Taking a break, Krishna stretches out under the trees with a glass of tart soursop juice. Looking around his six-acre farm, vibrant with about 140 varieties of local herbs and vegetables, he explains how Solitude, which started in 1996, thrives on ‘do-nothing farming,’ inspired by Japanese zen master and farmer Masanobu Fukuoka. (A proponent of natural farming, Masanobu is the author of the influential The One-Straw Revolution.)
Teenage beginnings
“I was 19 when I came here,” says Krishna, adding that India felt like home right from the beginning, perhaps because he studied at the J Krishnamurti School, Brockwood Park, in Hampshire, UK.
“When I first came to Auroville, in January 1993, we had no mobiles or Internet. We used to meet and plant trees,” he states, adding that his interest in farming was cemented by a chance encounter in 2003, when he was visiting Vandana Shiva’s farm in Dehradun.
“Masanobu was there, in a white beard and indigo robes... He explained how we cannot improve Nature. Instead by observing her natural processes and systems, we can achieve very high yields. His techniques were defined by his region, bioregion and topography...”
Krishna springs up and dives into the farm, ducking through water sprinklers. He scoops up a handful of rich, moist soil wriggly with earthworms. “We need to honour soil. Healthy soil results in nutritional diversity.”
Pivoting around, he says, “There is incredible variety here, and we did not even plant many of our indigenous greens. They spring up when you nurture the soil. We have Malabar spinach, amaranth and roselle, in addition to a range of keerais: kori keerai (waterleaf), agathi keerai, moringa, manathakkali, ponnanganni... We have medicinal herbs, like mudakathan (balloon vine), thoothuvalai (solanum) and guduchi (giloy)... They do not need a lot of water to grow, and thrive in this climate.”
Krishna’s mission now is to convince people to expand their culinary horizons. “Subscribers get what is in season,” he says, rifling through a basket. “This week, there is spring onion, bottle gourd, green papaya, ridge gourd...” He holds up a bunch of greens, punctuated with bright blue flowers. “This is the juice kit: soursop, tulsi, hibiscus and clitoria ternatea flower.” (Also known as the butterfly pea, the flower, in demand at trendy cafés around the globe, grows wild at Solitude.)
“When we adopt the principles of permaculture, plants start emerging everywhere. Where did this sundakkai (turkey berry) come from?” asks Krishna, pointing at a hardy plant. “I have no idea,” he shrugs. “We planted about 24 fruit trees, then added papaya, turmeric, pineapples and drumstick around them, followed by tomatoes, ladies fingers and greens. Then the ‘volunteers’ turned up: chillies, ponnanganni, nannari (sarsaparilla)... we did not plant those. They were free!”
Tradition on a plate
The produce makes its way into Solitude’s restaurant, which specialises in serving healthy, traditional thalis. “We cook local food that represents the cultural, nutritional heritage of this bioregion,” says Krishna. “Sundakkai sambar, green papaya kara kuzhambu, tapioca chips, ragi adai, mudakathan dosai and thoothuvalai rasam.”
Meals are cooked fresh, over a wood fire. Krishna pauses. “It is not easy. We are going against the flow of a tsunami. But we do not see this as just a restaurant. It is a social learning space.” He adds, “It is important we celebrate local produce. Otherwise, we will become homogeneous. I do not even have a university degree. I have nothing special about me.... If I can do it, anyone can.”
Solitude Farm is in Auroville. The café is open from Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 3 pm. Krishna runs a free tour of the farm on Saturdays at 11.30 am.

Highlights This Rajasthani vada is made using four types of dal
It is highly dense in protein content
Pair your masala chai with this crunchy and crispy snack
India is home to a variety of regional cuisines, which offer quintessential traditional delicacies of their own. One such cuisine is from the state of Rajasthan, which offers everything from laal maas and gatte ki sabzi to dal baati churma. While all of these are quite popular in the region, there is another traditional Rajasthani delight that is often savoured as a tea-time snack. We're talking about kalmi vada. The recipe of Rajasthani special kalmi vada has been shared by Ananya Banerjee, a popular YouTube chef and food vlogger, on her channel 'Chef Ananya Banerjee'.


Highly dense in protein content, this snack is made using four types of dal - chana, masoor, moong and toor. Another healthy addition is that of grated cabbage (patta gobhi), which not only enhances the health quotient of the snack but also improves the texture of it. Cabbage along with besan helps bind the vadas so that they don't end up breaking at the time of deep-frying.

Story 20
McLaren F1 boss Andreas Seidl says the Woking-based outfit has many things to take away from last Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix, starting with the fact that it still has to work to do "to become a better team".
McLaren race was a story of starting near the front where it battled the usual suspects only to slide out of contention and mishandle a pitstop, leaving the papaya squad with zero points for the first time since Spa and more questions than answers.
At least there was a clear reason for Lando Norris' botched pitstop, but both Carlos Sainz and Norris' dismal pace on the hard tyre baffled McLaren.
"A painful Sunday for us, after having several good race weekends or good Sundays, for different reasons," said Seidl.
"First of all, especially on the hard tyres, we didn’t have the pace we have seen in the last two days with the car.
"It is something we need to analyse and understand, if it was related to track temperatures being higher, or something else.
"Then obviously after having good starts with both cars, having the pitstop issue on Lando’s car destroyed his race and his race was over."
Seidl admitted to being puzzled by the contrast in performance between qualifying and race day.
"Definitely in terms of pace it was a setback," he added. "And actually it was the first time in quite some time that we have seen a different pace on Sunday compared to the other two days of the weekend so we simply need to analyse what the issue is.
"Lots of opportunities today to learn from and simply was a reminder that we still have a lot of work to do to become a better team.
"A day like this is part of the process for our team to become a better team."
Seidl admitted that McLaren was lucky to conceded only a handful of points to its main midfield rival - Renault - in the Constructors' standings, thanks to all cars from the top teams tying up the first six spots in the race's final results.
"As we always said it is not done until it is done because you just need a strange race and suddenly someone scoring big points," said the German.

Sharing is caring!
Summers are synonymous with hot blazing sun, hot and humid temperature, and excess sweating. And along with this, many people tend to suffer from heat rashes. These are also known as sweat rashes or prickly heat rashes. In medical terms, this condition is known as miliaria. People of all ages get affected by this condition.
It mostly happens to people who live in hot, humid climates. Living in such conditions leads to excessive sweating that can cause the sweat glands to become blocked.
Other causes of prickly heat are bacterial infections and underdeveloped sweat glands. Being overweight and leading a sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk for it.
Sandalwood Powder
Sandalwood has soothing properties that can effectively eliminate prickly heat symptoms. It can also help cool your body temperature, which is essential for fast recovery.
Prepare a paste by mixing together equal amounts of sandalwood powder and rose water. Apply this paste on the affected skin, and leave it on until it dries. Rinse it off with cold water. Follow this remedy twice daily for a week.
Alternatively, mix two tablespoons each of sandalwood powder and coriander powder with enough rose water to make a thick paste. Smear the paste on the affected area and let it dry on its own. Wash with cold water and pat dry your skin. Repeat twice daily for a week.
Chickpea Flour
Make a thick paste of chickpea flour using some water. Apply the paste onto the affected part and let it stand for about 15 minutes. Use cool water to wash off the paste. This home remedy will provide relief from the itching and prickling sensation.
Fuller’s Earth
Fuller’s earth or Multani mitti has long been used for treating prickly heat. Take four tablespoons of Fuller’s earth and mix a few drops of rose water to make a paste. Apply the paste on the affected areas and wash off with cold water after about three hours.
Aloe Vera
Owing to its anti-inflammatory, soothing and cooling properties, aloe vera is an excellent home remedy for prickly heat.
Extract fresh aloe vera gel from an aloe leaf.
Rub the gel over the affected skin.
Leave it on for at least 20 minutes, and then take a cold bath.
Do this at least two times a day for about a week.
Baking Soda
While bathing, soak yourself in warm water containing a little baking soda or finely ground oatmeal powder. This is a good remedy to ease the itchy prickly sensation of the heat rashes.
Oatmeal Bath
Run an oatmeal bath and soak yourself in it for 15 to 20 minutes. You also can use the oatmeal to scrub the affected areas gently. It will help to exfoliate the skin and clear the blocked sweat ducts. This home remedy for prickly heat is great for getting relief from the itching and inflammation, if any.
Cucumbers
Cucumbers have a cooling effect that soothes and helps cool the affected skin. It can also give relief from itching.
Cut a cucumber into thin slices. Soak them for a few minutes in a bowl of cold water mixed with two tablespoons of lemon juice. Place the soaked cucumber slices on the affected areas for 10 minutes. Do this three times daily for a week.
You can also rub cucumber pulp on the affected area. Leave it on for 30 minutes, and then wash it off with cool water. This will cool the area and lessen the itching. Do this several times a day for a week to promote healing.
As cucumber has high water content, also eat it daily to keep the body hydrated.
Usually heat rash disappears within a week using these natural treatments. If you do not get relief within a week or if some kind of skin infection develops, seek medical help.
Ice Cubes
Take some ice cubes and put it in water. Once the water gets chilled, use a clean, soft washcloth to dab the water on your skin. Alternatively, you can also rub ice cubes on your skin to get relief from that prickling sensation.
Papaya
The tropical fruit papaya is also one of the great home remedies for prickly heat rash. Mash a ripe papaya and apply it on your skin. Let it stay for about 20 to 25 minutes before washing it off with tap water. This will ease the burning sensation and also provide relief from the itching.
Talcum Powder
After your bath, apply non-perfumed or herbal talcum powder on your skin about three to four times a day. The powder will help keep the body, sweat and moisture free.
Additional tips to prevent prickly heat
Do not wear tight clothing that can irritate the skin.
Sleep in a cool and well ventilated area.
Avoid using creams or oil that can block the skin’s pores.
Drink plenty of water during hot weather.
When outside, try to stay in shaded areas.
Take cool baths, if possible two or three times a day.
Avoid exposure to excessive heat and humidity whenever possible.

Pineapple and papaya are often included in marinades. It’s clear that these fruits add delicious flavor and sweetness to your meat, but there’s far more going on here. These fruits hold secret powers that help make meats more scrumptious, and there’s more science in these sauces than you might expect.
There are many marinade recipes to choose from. However, some ingredients do more than just impart a delicious flavor. Pineapple and papaya contain flesh-dissolving enzymes! These specialized proteins help break down tough meat, creating a delicious and tender meal.
How Fruit Tenderizes Meat
The power of these fruits to create succulent meats comes from specialized proteins. Proteins are the molecular machines of life. They are responsible for everything from vision to digestion. One group of proteins, called enzymes, are responsible for assembling and disassembling other molecules.
Enzymes called proteases even disassemble other proteins. Papaya and pineapple contain large amounts of these enzymes. When added to meat, they break down the structural protein that makes the meat tough.
Tough meat gets its texture from the muscle and connective tissue that makes it up. These are made of long chains of amino acids (the building blocks of protein.) Proteases work by breaking these chains.
Acidic marinades containing vinegar or lemon juice work in a similar way. They unwind proteins by changing the pH. However, enzymes generally work faster than acids.
These two fruits contain different types of this enzyme with very similar effects. When the meat is marinated in either juice, it quickly becomes tender. It is important to marinate the meat for no more than 30 minutes to keep it from getting too soft.
Pineapple ( Ananas comosus )
Pineapples contain bromelain, a group of meat-eating proteins. They are concentrated in the stems of the plant but can be found throughout. Therefore, pineapple extracts are often made from the stems of the plant. These extracts can be used to tenderize meat or as a folk-medicine.
This protein is named for the plant family, Bromeliaceae. This family includes pineapples as well as Spanish moss (which is not a true moss.)
This protein is also found in the fruit. This means pineapple juice makes a great ingredient for marinades. This sweet fruit also gives marinades a delicious flavor. It can be added to a Hawaiian style meal or a classic BBQ sauce to make the meal tender and sweet.
Other Uses
The enzymes in pineapple have been used medicinally for a number of purposes. Pineapple has long been used as a folk medicine. It is sold as an anti-inflammatory as well as a digestive supplement. It has also been approved in Europe to treat severe burns.
Bromelain is also being investigated to treat a number of other medical conditions. It is important to consult a medical professional before trying to use bromelain as a medicine. Its effectiveness and safety have not been well established.
Some potential uses for bromelain include:
Chest pain due to heart disease
Bronchitis
Sinus infections
Surgical trauma
Thrombosis
Osteoarthritis
Diarrhea
Heart disease
Papaya ( Carica papaya )
Papayas contain an enzyme with similar effects to pineapple. This compound is called papain. It is mostly found in young, green papayas. Commercial meat tenderizers are usually made of papaya enzymes.
Some people are allergic to papain. It is important to consult a doctor if you have concerns, or before using it to treat a medical condition.
Closely related species like mountain papaya also contain similar enzymes.
Other Uses
Papain can also be used for a number of other purposes. It has been used in a number of industrial and food processes. These include:
Clarifying beer
Treating silk and wool for dying
Removing hair from leather
Manufacturing rubber
Papain also shows promise for a number of medical uses including:
Aiding digestion
Treating ulcers
Reducing swelling
Treating parasites
As an antibiotic
The meat dissolving enzymes of papaya and pineapple make a great marinade! It is important to remember not to marinate your meat too long. These enzymes can easily go too far, making the meat into mush. Do not marinate in these fruit for longer than 30 minutes. Keeping the marinade cold may slow its effects. Therefore, if you need extra time before cooking your meat, make sure to put it in the back of the fridge!

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning on Friday for New England residents to avoid eating papayas from Mexico.
These papayas have been linked to 62 cases of salmonella infection across eight states. 23 people have been hospitalized, but there are no deaths as of yet.
People typically get infected by Salmonella bacteria by consuming dairy and eggs, though infections can also come from consuming poultry, vegetables, and fruits.

New England residents have been warned to stop eating papayas imported from Mexico.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a food safety alert on Friday that linked 62 cases of salmonella infection across eight states to whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico and sold in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.
So far 23 people have been hospitalized, but there have not been any deaths linked to the outbreak. The first case was reported on January 14, with the most recent on June 8, 2019. Most illnesses have occurred since April 2019, the alert said.
The CDC urges consumers to "throw the papayas away, even if some of them were eaten and no one has gotten sick." Officials are also warning people not to eat fruit salads or other mixes that include papayas from Mexico, and encouraging consumers to wash and sanitize places where papayas were stored like countertops and refrigerator drawers.
According to the CDC, "this investigation is ongoing and the advice will be updated when more information is available."
But health officials are counseling Americans to be extra cautious: "If you aren't sure the papaya you bought is from Mexico, you can ask the place of purchase. When in doubt, don't eat the papaya. Throw it out."
Salmonella can come from more than just eggs
Salmonella bacteria sickens 1.2 million people in the US every year, leading to about 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths.
A person can get sick from eating food that has been contaminated by one of 2,300 types of salmonella bacteria. The two most common types found in the US, Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium, account for about half of human infections, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This latest outbreak involves a type of bacteria called Salmonella uganda.
Eggs and dairy products are one of the most common sources of the foodborne illness, but infections with salmonella — which cause an illness known as salmonellosis — also come from eating poultry, meat, fruits, vegetables, spices, and nuts, among other things.
Read More: More than 206 million eggs have been recalled because of a salmonella outbreak — here's what the illness is and how to avoid it
In April 2018, an outbreak linked to the herbal supplement kratom sickened at least 132 people in 38 states. Less than a year later, the CDC issued a warning that linked cuddling and coming into contact with pet hedgehogs to a salmonella outbreak.
Children, especially those under 5, are at the highest risk for infection, and illnesses caused by these infections are most severe for infants, older people, and anyone with a weakened immune system.
Regarding the current outbreak linked to papaya consumption, the average age of sickened people is 60, though the cases in question involve people ranging in age from 1 to 86 years. A little over 50% of the cases are female patients.
Most people who get sick from salmonella develop diarrhea, a fever, and abdominal cramps within three days and the illness can last for about four to seven days. Many recover without treatment, aside from rest and rehydration, though it can take several months for bowel movements to normalize.
In particularly severe cases, diarrhea can get bad enough that warrants hospitalization. If the infection spreads from the intestines into the bloodstream, it can be fatal without antibiotic treatment.

One of the reasons why fresh produce causes so many contamination recalls is that it often isn’t cooked—so the bacteria survives.
On August 26th, the FDA issued a letter addressed to “Papaya Growers, Harvesters, Packers, Distributors, Exporters, Importers, and Retailers.” Basically: all papaya people. It states that the FDA has seen a pattern of outbreaks from papayas over the past several years, from which hundreds have been sickened and two have died.
Since 2011, the FDA says, there have been eight significant outbreaks of Salmonella tied to papayas. The letter is, effectively, a warning shot to the papaya industry: get your stuff together, because we’ve noticed that there have been problems. The most recent outbreak occurred just a few weeks ago; the FDA tied the illnesses to a specific brand of Mexican papaya, sold by a Bronx-based wholesaler.
Interestingly, that wholesaler—Agroson’s LLC—refused to initiate a voluntary recall. Agroson’s says that, despite an instance of Salmonella in its papayas in 2017, the evidence against the company in the new outbreak is “tenuous and insufficient to establish a causal link to the outbreak.”
The FDA’s letter includes some requests to the papaya industry, largely in the form of updating the production to ensure outbreaks are minimized. Those include monitoring the water used to grow the fruit for contamination, investing in more preventive research, and creating new tools for transparency in tracing.
The FDA says that it will “use all the tools and enforcement powers we have available” to help the papaya industry stop these outbreaks, mostly involving training and education. “However,” reads the letter, “we can’t do this alone and believe that more must be done by industry as repeated outbreaks are unacceptable from a public health perspective.”
In the meantime, the FDA still urges consumers to avoid the Cavi brand of papayas—those are the ones sold by Agroson’s—because those are still on store shelves. Hopefully, the papaya industry can figure out a way to ensure their tasty fruits are safe to eat.

Story 27
“This is a 10-week gravid uterus,” Zoey Thill said, holding up a "pregnant" papaya the size of a large fist. “And this,” she added, gesturing to her own pregnant belly, “is a 38-week gravid uterus.”
Thill, a New York City-based abortion provider, was explaining the anatomy of the uterus to a group of about a dozen of us, in Verso Books’ Brooklyn office on a Monday night. The narrow part of the papaya, where the stem would be, is like the cervix, she said. The broader portion of the papaya is like the upper area of the uterus known as the fundus—and it's that part we would want to avoid puncturing with our tools when, in just a few minutes, we would practice performing an aspiration abortion on our own papayas.
But if we did by accident, that was OK, Thill said. “We’re not going to shame perforators,” she reassured.
Thill brought us to a long table across the room, where several Hawaiian papayas were lined up on surgical pads. After telling us about the tools that were laid out—plus the ones she didn’t have with her, the speculum and tenaculum—Thill demonstrated a first-trimester abortion on the papaya she’d displayed earlier. She talked to the “patient” throughout, checking in on how they were doing as she inserted a finger into the “cervix,” then pantomimed inserting the speculum; she pretended to apply the local anesthetic and then began inserting the metal tapered rods on the table one by one to dilate the opening.
When the papaya was fully “dilated,” she placed a plastic tube called a cannula inside and attached it to a manual vacuum aspirator, a plastic, syringe-like device, sucking out the inner contents of the papaya: what, for our purposes, was the pregnancy. From start to finish, the procedure had taken no more than three minutes.
Thill admired the seeds in the plastic tube. “This is a really fucking good one.”
Then it was our turn. We partnered up, holding the papayas for each other as we repeated what she had just shown us. I felt slightly nervous, even though I knew I was only practicing on a fruit, not a person. Thill held the papaya for me and after I dilated it, she reminded me how to attach the aspirator to the cannula. I clamped down the two small locks on the end of the instrument, pulled the handle toward me to create suction, and eased it gently onto the plastic tube—I wasn’t going to be the one to perforate my papaya’s fundus.
In one smooth motion, I rotated the aspirator, drawing out dozens of seeds, surprised and pleased to see that my amateur skills could produce the same result. Next to me, others were doing the same, rejoicing with every successful extraction. “Yes!” they exclaimed each time.
“It’s even more satisfying when it’s a real abortion,” Thill said.
All of us were successful at extracting the seeds from our papayas. (Courtesy of NYC for Abortion Rights)
Papaya workshops like the one Thill hosted are nothing new. They date back to 2005, when two professors from the University of California, San Francisco published a paper showing that, because of its size and composition, a papaya could serve as a “simulation model” for training in a first-trimester abortion procedure known as manual vacuum aspiration, or MVA. Reproductive Health Access Project (RHAP) used the research to design a comprehensive papaya training for medical students, nurses, and doctors to teach them to provide the procedure in a clinical setting. About five years ago, RHAP began offering the workshops to non-clinical audiences, and have hosted hundreds since.
As threats to Roe v. Wade escalate, the workshops have been getting more attention, and finding wider audiences. Earlier this month, former New Jersey abortion clinic director Jen Moore Conrow and Abortion Access Front founder Lizz Winstead demonstrated an abortion on a watermelon (at the time, there’d been a salmonella outbreak among papayas) at the annual progressive political convention Netroots, to an audience of around 100 people. Winstead said she had been to several RHAP workshops before, but this was her first in front of a group this large.
Lisa Maldonado, RHAP’s executive director, said over the last couple of years she’s noticed an upswing in the number of requests the organization has gotten to host papaya workshops. And more individual abortion providers like Thill, who learned how to provide abortions on papayas as medical students, have taken it upon themselves to develop similar workshops and trainings and open them up to the public. I’d found out about Thill’s on Facebook.
The point of papaya workshops isn’t necessarily to teach people how to perform an aspiration abortion at home. Thill said she wanted to educate people about what an abortion procedure entails—information she believes shouldn’t belong only to doctors—to help combat fear, misinformation, and stigma. “I just want to be clear that when you leave here you won’t be competent at providing abortions, so don’t go fucking crazy,” Thill said by way of disclaimer.

Later, Thill told me she hopes to eventually host an event for people providing underground abortions; she just hasn’t found such a group of people yet. (Thill is less likely to find one in New York, where abortion rights were recently enshrined in state law.) But we know they exist: A 2018 story in California Sunday Magazine described a covert network of providers performing abortions outside the medical system. And in her new book Everything Below the Waist, Jennifer Block writes about attending a secret speculum insertion and papaya workshop taught by a clandestine provider who asked not to be identified for fear of being discovered by law enforcement.
Still, most organizations and doctors who host the workshops for laypeople say their primary aim is to demystify abortion, and change the way supporters of the procedure advocate for it.
“We see it as a strategy to start a really honest conversation about what abortion is and isn’t, and destigmatize it,” Maldonado said. “The papaya workshop helps us do that in a really concrete way, usually in a small group setting where we can answer whatever questions people have.”
Thill focused some of the night’s discussion on language: Instead of calling aspiration abortion and other abortion procedures performed later in pregnancy “surgical abortion,” she advised people use the term “procedural abortion.” The word “surgical,” Thill argued, suggested incisions, and implied a patient who obtained such an abortion might have a lengthy recovery process ahead of them. “It makes it sound way more dramatic than it needs to be,” she said. “Also, I’m not a surgeon.”
Thill told me that, at one of the first events she hosted, a woman who’d had an abortion years ago said that though she didn’t regret it, she’d had some unresolved feelings about the procedure. After seeing Thill demonstrate an abortion, she said she realized those feelings stemmed from the fact that she hadn’t known what had actually happened to her body.
Thill said she hopes the workshops serve the dual purpose of empowering those who might one day have an abortion themselves, and educating advocates—as well as doctors—about how shifting our rhetoric around the procedure might strengthen arguments for people’s right to access it. She wondered if participants might capture some of the buoyant energy they felt while extracting seeds from fruits and use it to undo some of the seriousness and reverence we’ve placed around the procedure.
A woman who’d had an abortion told Thill that though she didn’t regret it, she had some unresolved feelings. After seeing Thill demonstrate an abortion, she realized it was because she didn’t know what actually happened to her body.
“The more I can minimize the way we think of this as a ‘dangerous’ procedure, the more people will have better abortion experiences,” she told me the next day.
After we’d all performed our papaya abortion, I spoke to an attendee named Nikki Blazek, an activist with the larger group that set up the workshop, NYC for Abortion Rights. She told me she’s often troubled by the way conservative rhetoric can seep into the pro-choice movement, mentioning phrases like “safe, legal, and rare,” which seem to apologize for abortion instead of advocating for it. She said when she saw how quick and simple the procedure was, it only affirmed her belief that abortion is an indisputably good thing, and that she and her fellow activists shouldn’t try to soften their language to try to appease their anti-choice opponents.
“[I] believe in an unapologetic abortion rights movement and building a grassroots strategy to fight back against bigotry and fascism,” Blazek said later. “Participating in this workshop makes me feel more confident and prepared to deal with an increasingly frightening reality as our rights continue to be chipped away.”
As the evening wound down, Thill encouraged everyone to take home a papaya. One straggler left with two or three, which she loaded into a tote with a book she’d brought along: Robin Marty’s Handbook for a Post-Roe America.
“I took a green one home with me,” Blazek said. “I'm going to use it to make a salad with some Thai peppers from my window garden.”

For Immediate Release: August 26, 2019 Statement From: Statement Author Leadership Role Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs - Food and Drug Administration Norman E. "Ned" Sharpless MD Leadership Role Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response - Food and Drug Administration Frank Yiannas
Español
Every day Americans enjoy an abundant food supply that is among the safest in the world. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration works tirelessly to ensure that foods available to consumers, whether they are produced domestically or abroad, meet the FDA’s food safety requirements and that we are using all available tools to ensure compliance.
As demand and tastes continue to drive change in the market, consumers’ desire for a variety of products available year-round have increased the number of imported foods offered for sale in the U.S. To keep up with this trend, we have doubled down on our efforts to ensure the safety of imported food. This includes issuing a new Strategy for the Safety of Imported Food and requesting new funding from Congress to support our efforts.
While we continue to focus on shifting our work upholding food safety from response to prevention, we know that there are times where we will still need to respond to problems when they arise, including outbreaks of foodborne illness. This is especially important when we see recurrent patterns of illness associated with particular commodities. For example, fresh papayas. This commodity is most often eaten raw, without cooking or processing to eliminate microbial hazards; and therefore, the way they are grown, harvested, packed, held, processed and distributed is crucial to minimizing the risk of contamination with human pathogens.
Unfortunately, since 2011, American consumers have been exposed to eight outbreaks caused by Salmonella serotypes linked to imported, fresh papaya. And, just this June we started an investigation into an outbreak of Salmonella Uganda illnesses tied to the consumption of whole, fresh papaya imported from Mexico. While the 2019 outbreak is ongoing, the first seven outbreaks accounted for almost 500 reported cases of illness, more than 100 hospitalizations, and two deaths.
This trend has to stop. The pattern of recurrent outbreaks we have observed since 2011, including the 2019 illnesses, have involved Salmonella infections traced back to, or are suspected of being associated with, papaya grown in Mexico. The recurring nature of these outbreaks is a clear indication that more must be done within all sectors of the papaya industry to protect its customers and to meet its legal obligations. This includes growers, importers and even retailers that can and must do more.
This is why today we have issued a letter calling on all sectors of the papaya industry to take actions to prevent these outbreaks in the future. We are urging growers, packers, shippers and retailers in the papaya industry to review their operations and make all necessary changes to strengthen public health safeguards.
Our letter calls on the papaya industry to assess the factors that make their crops vulnerable to contamination. If a foodborne pathogen is identified in the crop or growing environment, a root cause analysis should be performed to determine the likely source of contamination. Procedures and practices that minimize that contamination must be implemented.
We are strongly encouraging the papaya industry to examine the use and monitoring of water used to grow, spray (pesticides, fungicides), move, rinse or wax crops to identify and minimize risks from potential hazards. All sectors of the industry should adopt tools and practices needed to enhance traceability since papayas are a perishable commodity, to more rapidly facilitate the tracking of involved product to expedite its removal from commerce, prevent additional consumer exposures, and properly focus any recall actions.
And finally, they should fund and actively engage in food safety research to identify the potential sources and routes of contamination by microbial pathogens and develop data-driven and risk-based preventive controls.
In response to this most recent Salmonella Uganda outbreak, the FDA deployed an inspection team to the packing house and farm that was linked to the contaminated papayas via traceback and epidemiological evidence. The findings of those visits will be made public when their investigation is complete. We have also increased sampling and screening of papayas at the border. In addition, the FDA is actively collaborating with our counterparts in the Mexican government regarding this current outbreak through the agency’s Latin America Office to determine ways to further our collaborative prevention efforts.
The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits food producers from introducing, or delivering for introduction, into interstate commerce adulterated foods (meaning foods that are potentially harmful to consumers). Additionally, there are new requirements under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The Produce Safety Rule under FSMA sets science- and risk-based minimum standards for domestic and foreign farms for the safe growing, harvesting, packing and holding of covered produce, which includes papayas. Another FSMA rule, the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) makes importers responsible for verifying that the foods they bring into the U.S., including papayas, have been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. safety standards.
We take our responsibility to protect public health very seriously and will continue to use all of our regulatory authorities and enforcement tools available to do so. So, today we issued a warning letter to a papaya importer, Agroson’s LLC, following an FDA investigation at the facility in conjunction with the current outbreak. This investigation uncovered significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Rest assured that the FDA will continue to strengthen safeguards and prevent contaminated papayas from being imported into the U.S. Our efforts also include education, outreach, training and research activities designed to support farmers’ efforts to keep their crops safe for consumers.
Although today’s actions focus on the papaya industry, recurring outbreaks taking place with any commodity are unacceptable from a public health perspective. We know that more must be done by industry as repeated illness outbreaks are a threat to public health. In such situations, it is incumbent upon all sectors of the industry to work together to investigate the cause, review food safety procedures and practices, and take action to prevent further outbreaks.
We must take collective steps to eliminate the threat that recurring outbreaks pose to consumers and look forward to working with the papaya industry as well as all food producers to ensure that America’s food supply remains among the safest in the world.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

Eco-Friendly Paper Seed Flag by Eco Friends Group to Mark Kannada Rajotsava
Mangaluru : After promoting Clay lamps (Diya) which are an indispensable part of the festival of lights— Deepavali, and delivered them to those who booked online during the certain period of time during Diwali, Eco Friends Group in Mangaluru has come out with an eco-friendly paper seed flag to celebrate Kannada Rajyotsava, which is on 2 November. Last year the same Group had initiated several green programmes in the City, including the ‘Thota Ganappa’, a eco-friendly Ganesha idol concept during Ganesh Chaturthi festival. Nearly 500 paper seed flags will be distributed prior to Rajoystava in five schools.
Speaking to Team Mangalorean, Rajesh, the President of Eco Friends Group said, “The paper seed flag will be distributed to students in five schools in Mangaluru. About 100 such flags will be distributed in each school for Rajyotsava. Today we distributed such flags to students of Canara High School-Urwa, Govt Primary school-Urwa and Govt High School- Mallikatte/Kadri. These bio-degradable paper seed flags not only decompose in soil within a short period, but will grow into fruit-yielding trees and vegetables”.
Rajesh further said, “We wanted to reduce the waste. The paper used in the flag has two layers. One layer has the Karnataka flag for Rajyotsava and the backside of the flag has seeds of papaya and tomato pinned to it. The seeds will sprout within a week of being put in flower pots or soil. Each flag has three to four types of seeds. The children can dispose after the Rajyotsava celebrations. We also conducted many experiments. The seeds had sprouted within a few days of being placed in pots. A flag of 3 cm X 2 cm size can be pinned onto shirts or sarees,”.
“If the flag proves a hit during Rajyotsava, the Eco Friends Group intends to replicate it during Independence Day celebrations in 2020. Despite of the ban on plastic flags, many still use them and dump them on the roads after the celebrations. The dye used in the paper seed flag is not harmful to Nature. The seed flags will also be distributed free of cost at the ‘Savayava Santhe’ (organic market) held near Mannagudda in the City on Sunday after Rajyotsava. Next year we also plan to visit schools and teach students how to prepare such flags. Our main aim is to encourage gardening among school students during time of Rajoysava, thereby put an end to use of plastic flags” added Rajesh.

Every year, nearly half of the world population is at risk of catching dengue, a mosquito borne viral infection that often turns lethal, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says.
Transmitted by female mosquitoes mainly of the Aedes aegypti species and to a lesser extent the Aedes albopictus, it is widespread throughout the tropics, with rainfall, temperature and unplanned urbanisation being catalysts to its growth.
Dengue fever has no prescribed medication and thus, a lot of rest and the right diet is the only way to recover from the disease. It is extremely important to take effective care and preventive measures. If a person feels feverish and experience body pain paired with rashes, they should immediately get checked for dengue. A drop in platelet count is usually indicative of the disease.
Here are a few foods that can propel a person towards recovery by increasing platelet counts, according to a report in Pinkvilla.
Broccoli: Broccoli is a great source of Vitamin K, which helps to regenerate blood platelets and should be included in the daily diet of dengue patients.
Pomegranate: Rich in nutrients and minerals that provide the required energy, it helps patients fight exhaustion and fatigue. Being a rich source of iron, it also helps maintaining blood platelet count.
Spinach: A rich source of iron and omega-3 fatty acids, it helps improve the immune system.
Papaya leaves: Papaya leaf extract increases platelet count and is perhaps the best home remedy for dengue.
Coconut water: Consumption of coconut water is a must as it provides all the minerals and electrolytes that the body requires after it has lost them due to dehydration.
Citrus fruits: Packed with vitamins and daily nutrients, they help dengue patients in a speedy recovery. Consumption of citrus fruit juices like orange juice helps in digestion and increases urinary output of dengue patients.

‘There was this trend of eating sushi from a woman’s naked body. So when I found the perfect papaya, I knew exactly how to shoot it’
A decade ago, I was fascinated by papaya – the colour, the shape, the seeds that are almost like fish eggs. So when I found the perfect one, I knew exactly how I wanted to shoot it.
My boyfriend Moro and I were living in Brooklyn at the time. This was our first apartment in New York. There were no windows in our bedroom, but the kitchen gave on to the backyard and had good light. So that’s where I worked.
I first saw Moro on my first day in grad school, at the University of Memphis in Tennessee. He was very tanned and I couldn’t work out where he was from, or even what race he was. He’s actually from Japan, but for some reason I imagined he was an islander of some kind. He was so cool and so skinny and a music student, too (he studied jazz, double bass). I wondered what it would feel like to be his girlfriend. I imagined he didn’t talk to people much.
A year later, I saw him again and thought: “Oh! It’s the very skinny islander!” He seemed cold, and mature. I went to talk to him. When I got to know him, I realised he was actually really young – he’d only just graduated high school in Japan – and very shy.
I was pretending I was really taking my time, enjoying eating my papaya
We shot this around noon. I tend to wake up late. It’s titled Start Your Day with a Good Breakfast Together, mostly because we usually eat bread for breakfast. I don’t remember if I bought the other fruits, or if that’s just what I had to hand. I did spend a long time choosing the right colour and shape cup, and arranging all the elements.
I started with Moro’s pose, and then tried different ones for myself. At the time, there was a Japanese trend of eating sushi from a naked woman’s body. I was pretending I was really taking my time, enjoying eating my papaya. I also had in mind Nobuyoshi Araki’s famous photograph of a woman sitting on a street corner, eating from a broken watermelon on the ground beside her. I liked the relationship it drew between open fruit and eating, and sexuality.
There’s a lot of humour in this work – Moro once commented that he and I are like comedians. The project is a collaborative performance. I direct the overall composition, but the way Moro lays his body, say, is often all him. And if we’re both in the shot, he’s usually the one to actually click: I work with very long exposures, and holding the airbulb for the shutter release is hard work, so he does it.
I like giving him that control. I’ve been at exhibition openings where someone has commented that I’m the lady in the photograph, and they’ve asked Moro if he’s the photographer. Finding out that it is my work has changed how they’ve understood it.
If people in the west, particularly men, don’t like this image, they say it’s an Asian thing: an Asian couple doing their weird thing. But in labelling it that way, they’re saying it does not relate to me or my life or the world I live in.
In China, younger girls especially really get what the image is about. They grew up with the same expectations as I did of what a woman should be and do, and they can relate to the same desire to be the opposite of that.
Michael Spencer Jones's best photo: Oasis's Definitely Maybe album cover Read more
Moro and I have been collaborating – and living together – for 13 years now. Each image reflects my thinking about our relationship at that particular moment: together, they’re like a notebook, a record of our history. This photograph represents the height of my dominance in the work, when I was thinking about how much more experience I had, how much more than him I knew, how I needed to tell him what to do. A decade on, we’ve both grown up and the images we make now are more collaborative, the situation’s more balanced.
It is one of Moro’s least favourite images. He’s very supportive of my work, and he’s fine with the pose. He just doesn’t like how his hair looked that day. Over time, I’ve come to agree. It wasn’t trimmed; it’s messy, it’s separating in the front.
When I was in school, a teacher told me that I would come to treasure the photographs I took when I was young. And now I know what she meant. Looking at this now, I think: “Wow, this was our bodies, our look, our place.” It’s a precious memory.

Some of the ‘home remedies’ are interesting (Picture: Getty)
Please don’t give up birth control in favour of using fruit, vegetables and herbs.
We shouldn’t have to say it but a tweet offering a list of ‘home remedies’ to use as contraception has gone viral, with over 12,000 likes.
Most of the remedies are not effective at preventing you getting pregnant and some of them are even toxic.
Botanist James Wong tweeted: ‘As a botanist I can tell you this tweet with 1000s of shares could result in the deaths of women. It needs taking down, fast.’
One particular piece of advice that was particularly worrying was using the plant pennroyal, as if you eat or drink it in high quantities, it could make you seriously ill.
The graphic says ‘Pennroyal promotes menstrual flow and helps initiate self-abortion. Often it is prescribed with other herbs to prevent pregnancy. Boil 8 ounces of distilled or spring water.’

In reality, too much pennroyal can cause liver damage, seizures and even death.
Other recommendations include papaya, figs and ginger.
It says: ‘Papaya is an effective birth control remedy. You can eat papaya twice a day for 3-4 days after having an unsafe intercourse. It will help prevent pregnancy. Also, the seeds of papaya reduce the sperm count in males.’
For figs, it adds: ‘It is one of the best conception control methods. Eat 2-3 dried pieces of figs after having unsafe intercourse. It prevents pregnancy and treats many other irregularities in the body.’
‘Ginger promotes menstrual flow. Drink 2 cups of strong ginger tea every day to defer pregnancy.’
The list also suggests injecting neem oil, from the neem tree, into the ‘uterine horns’. We have no idea how you’re expected to do that but it’s probably not a great idea to start trying to inject anything that hasn’t been recommended by a health professional inside your own body.
Many of the others on the list can cause side effects like vomiting or irritation if you take too much.
The advice is not recommended by doctors (Picture: Home Remedy Hacks)

Bethany Fawcett, contraceptive and sexual health nurse for young people’s sexual health and wellbeing charity Brook, says: ‘Herbs and fruits should never be used as methods of contraception and some listed in this tweet can even be toxic and dangerous.
‘We encourage anyone looking for information and advice about contraception to access accurate and reliable sources provided by healthcare professionals such as brook.org.uk or the NHS website.’

Bethany added that there are many different types of contraception available and it is best to speak to your GP if you don’t like the current method you are using, rather than turning to the internet.
‘There are 15 methods of contraception available, and what works best for you will depend on your body and your preferences.
‘For those who do not want to use hormonal contraception, options include barrier methods such as condoms and internal condoms, diaphragms and caps, as well as the IUD (also known as the coil).
‘The IUD is a method of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and is one of the most effective methods available. It is also the most effective type of emergency contraception.
‘It is important to remember that condoms are the only method of contraception to protect against sexually transmitted infections as well as unwanted pregnancy.’

Story 40
File this under, “Don’t trust everything you read on the Internet.”
Twitter user and podcast host @MissBriaJanay has come under fire after tweeting an infographic of “natural” approaches to birth control. The pictures and information included in the infographic range from recommendations that either don’t work to this could literally kill you.
Included in the infographic — which has since been deleted — are various fruits and vegetables. Under papaya, the user claims eating the native Central American fruit twice a day 5-6 days after having unprotected sex will prevent a pregnancy. This is simply not true.
Papaya contains an enzyme called papain that aids in healthy digestion. It’s also high in fiber and water content, both of which work together to prevent constipation and aid in regularity. But it won’t prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or serve as contraceptive protection against pregnancy or STDs.
It just won’t. And it’s absolutely ludicrous that someone would share such blatantly false information on a platform full of gullible, impressionable young people.
But papaya is only the beginning.
The infographic — which went viral due to its lack of scientific backing and blatant spread of misinformation — also includes recommendations for eating wild yams and figs as an alternative contraceptive.
Again, not accurate.
The infographic recommends eating wild yam daily so it “starts functioning as a birth prevention remedy.” Similarly, the graphic calls figs “one of the best contraception control methods,” suggesting women eat 2-5 dried figs after having unprotected intercourse.
What. The. Fuck.
A fig will not stop semen from fertilizing an egg. A fig will not stop ovulation. Neither will a goddamn yam.
Now, eating a yam, fig, or a slice of papaya will not harm you (though if you’re using it for pregnancy, it will not work). However, some of these recommendations are extremely harmful. Some are even fatal.
Pennyroyal oil makes the list, but the graphic makes no mention of pennyroyal’s historical use as an insecticide to regulate menstruation and induce abortion. Use of this plant comes with serious health warnings and risks. According to WebMD, it is not safe for children, pregnant women, or breastfeeding women to take and it can also cause severe injuries to the nervous system, liver, and kidneys. Pennyroyal oil can also lead to kidney and liver failure, ultimately causing death.
It’s not just pennyroyal oil that’s cause for concern. Many of the plants in the infographic are categorized as abortifacients, meaning they cause miscarriages. That’s not birth control; that’s an aborted pregnancy. The two are very different.
One (birth control) is about family planning; the other is dangerous if not used correctly.
In fact, you can die from an abortion induced by an abortifacient.
So, you might be wondering: Where the fuck did all this information come from? Did some random person without any knowledge or background in the science of contraception just decide to make a pretty picture on Photoshop? What’s the deal?
Historically, these fruits, vegetables, and plants have been linked to crude versions of abortions and “birth control.” But that does not mean they are safe, natural methods.
Papayas, for example, were used in Sri Lanka to prevent and terminate pregnancies. Let’s not forget, though, that among papayas, bicycle parts and coat hangers were also common tools for “birth control” and abortion in Sri Lanka. So, do we really want to go by those standards?
And then there are the yams. When creating the very first oral contraceptive pill, Planned Parenthood says Russell Marker discovered Mexican women using wild yam called the Barbasco root or cabeza de negro for contraception. Scientists then extracted the hormone progestin from these yams and combined it with estrogen to make the first-ever pill.
But again, let’s not believe everything we read on Twitter, okay? Birth control pills might have originated from yams, but it doesn’t mean it’s safe now.
In 2019. When we have access to non-hormonal birth control options like copper IUDs and condoms. Oh, and also hormonal birth control. These things exist. There’s no need to scarf down some ancient natural alternative that won’t work, could be harmful, or even deadly. (Read: To Anyone Who Doesn’t Believe Birth Control Has Health Benefits)
We should all know by now that not everything on the internet is true. (After all, President Cheez Doodle has access to the internet. Isn’t that proof enough?)
But please, be wary. Because the issue here isn’t that this podcast host follows her own version of “natural contraceptive” methods. The issue here is that some young impressionable girl who loves the podcast will follow these “methods” because the host told her to.
And that’s exactly where we fuck up, the internet fails us, and we fail each other.

Much like the old cilantro debate, people apparently have a lot of feelings about the way papaya tastes and smells. While some love the tropical fruit and experience no issues, others claim it smells like a myriad of unpleasant things (including vomit, rotten salmon, or dirty feet.)

It looks so yummy,but for the life of me I cant get with the smell or taste of papaya. — Tyler (@ChaoticTemptres) April 14, 2019
But, why are some people able to enjoy the fruit as-is, while others can’t stand to be around the smell? Turns out, there’s a scientific reason for why papaya stinks.
Papaya is chock-full of an enzyme called papain, which according to the Enzyme Education Institute has a “pungent, somewhat offensive” smell and “unpleasant” taste. Though the colorful description doesn’t exactly make you want to run out and eat it, papain has some amazing interesting benefits, including the fact that it helps our stomachs break down tough-to-digest proteins, like meat and eggs. In many cultures, papaya is even used as a salt-free meat tenderizer.
Another reason to give the stinky fruit a chance? Papaya is really nutritious—according to Nutrition Data, one cup of the fruit has 55 calories, 14g carbs, 2.5g of fiber, and only 8.3g of natural sugar. Not to mention, it’s loaded with vitamins. It packs 31% of your daily value for vitamin A, 144% of your vitamin C, 13% of your daily folate, and 10% of your daily calcium. It even has some Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.
If you can’t stand the smell, but still want to reap the health benefits, don’t lose hope. Turns out, a squeeze of lime juice over the top of papaya can help get rid of its unpleasant stink and taste. Bonus: According to the National Cancer Institute, citrus foods may help alleviate nausea without drastically changing the taste of the fruit or wrecking your stomach.
So, there you have it. The next time you want to enjoy a Papaya Breakfast Boat, a Papaya-Noodle Bowl, or just some fresh fruit salad, squeeze a bit of lime to mask the smell and taste—and enjoy all of the wonderful health benefits this tropical fruit provides.

Many in the media are gushing over learning how to perform abortions – on fruit.
Just this year, the trend has garnered coverage by outlets including Glamour magazine, the Cut, and, most recently, Vice. On July 24, Vice published the latest piece with the headline simply stating, “I Learned How to Do an Abortion on a Papaya.”
For the report, writer Marie Solis attended an abortion workshop hosted by New York City-based abortion provider Zoey Thill – at the offices of a Brooklyn book-publishing house, Verso Books. While 38-weeks pregnant, Thill used a papaya to represent a woman at 10 weeks of pregnancy.
“The narrow part of the papaya, where the stem would be, is like the cervix,” Solis remembered Thill teaching. “The broader portion of the papaya is like the upper area of the uterus known as the fundus—and it's that part we would want to avoid puncturing with our tools when, in just a few minutes, we would practice performing an aspiration abortion.”
The workshop gave insight into a sickening high that abortion providers – and their trainees – appear to enjoy when it comes to abortion.
While demonstrating a first-trimester abortion, Thill “inserted a finger into the ‘cervix,’ then pantomimed inserting the speculum; she pretended to apply the local anesthetic and then began inserting the metal tapered rods on the table one-by-one to dilate the opening,” Solis continued.
Then, Thill “placed a plastic tube called a cannula inside and attached it to a manual vacuum aspirator, a plastic, syringe-like device, sucking out the inner contents of the papaya: what, for our purposes, was the pregnancy.”
Or, rather, the baby.
“This is a really f**king good one,” Thill exclaimed.
When it was Solis’ turn, she “felt slightly nervous.” That quickly changed when she became “surprised and pleased to see that my amateur skills could produce the same result.”
She wasn’t alone. “Next to me, others were doing the same, rejoicing with every successful extraction. 'Yes!' they exclaimed each time,” Solis remembered.
Thill concluded, “It’s even more satisfying when it’s a real abortion.”
Or is it? Imagine the uproar if media delighted in a workshop training on “how to administer the death penalty” with fruit. Even then, there’s a difference. Those facing the death penalty have been found guilty; the unborn have not.
But whether born or unborn, guilty or innocent, a human life – a unique and unrepeatable person – is inherently sacred in that, while other humans can end it, they can never resurrect it.
According to Solis, Thill had her reasons for teaching the workshop. She hoped it would be “empowering those who might one day have an abortion” as well as “educating advocates—as well as doctors—about how shifting our rhetoric around the procedure might strengthen arguments for people’s right to access it.”
She also “wondered if participants might capture some of the buoyant energy they felt while extracting seeds from fruits and use it to undo some of the seriousness and reverence we’ve placed around the procedure.”
But reverence and seriousness shroud abortion for a reason: It’s the ending of a human life. To celebrate it is to not only mock the pro-life movement but also make light of the women who regret their abortions.
Solis stressed that “workshops like the one Thill hosted are nothing new.” They’re also nothing new for the media to cover – not even for Vice.
Five years ago, Vice published a story by Amanda Sperber who watched a papaya “abortion” with Reproductive Health Access Project (RHAP) as part of a “feminist camp.” Glamour contributor Meghan Racklin also attended an RHAP training she wrote about in January.
“I insert a thin metal instrument into the top of my papaya to create an opening before inserting a small suction device called an aspirator,” Racklin wrote. “There’s a slight slurping sound as the papaya seeds are sucked into the aspirator’s main chamber. Slurp. Slurp. Slurp. And then it’s done.”
And, in July, the Cut published a book excerpt by Jennifer Block about papaya abortion with the headline, “Not Your Grandmother’s Illegal Abortion.” Block remembers shouting, “It’s working!” while performing her “abortion.”
Afterwards, her anonymous teacher tried to recruit her.
“I would feel comfortable with you doing an MVA [manual vacuum aspiration] on me,” the teacher told Block. “You could totally do this.”
But “could” and “should” are two very different things.

At that time, if your plants are outside, place a female next to a male, and nature will do the work for you. If your plants are inside, take a Q-tip and swab the pollen inside the male flower, then rub it around the female flower. In about two weeks, if the pollination was successful, a fruit will start swelling from the female flower. Depending on the conditions, a papaya will be ready to harvest within six to 10 months.

Several things have been proposed recently to unite our mighty nation. Challenging the multiparty system, putting some politicians in jail, letting others out of jail, confining some people to their homes, forcing many others to leave their homes, speaking Hindi and so on. But I have begun to feel that the one thing the country has in common is its pursuit of papaya leaves.
In a sentimental short story by the always brilliant Malayalam writer Paul Zachariah, a man finds himself at the end of his tether. He has no work, no money and nothing to eat. He takes his little son along to the railway tracks and tells him that they have to stop a train and rob the passengers. He stands at the tracks armed with a papaya wrapped in newspaper. If he manages to stop the train, he will pretend it is a bomb to scare the passengers into handing over their cash, he decides. At the tracks, he dithers, continuously telling his silent son about his pangs of guilt. When it is time to take action, the man can’t do it. The idea of scaring random people on the train appals him. He tells his son that they should go home and eat the papaya instead. Despite the many things going on in the story, I have always been embarrassingly distracted by the papaya. The idea that a Malayali man, even in the most desperate straits, is likely to have a papaya always made me laugh and cry. But now that the leaves of the papaya, those leaves shaped like cartoon snowflakes, have became hot property, my feelings have changed.
As you must have guessed, I had dengue last week. I am sure you did too. Dengue and chikungunya are as new in our lives as Instagram but all three now seem like we have had them forever. Karnataka had over 10,000 cases of dengue this year, up 138% from last year. Fourteen members of the Border Roads Organisation in Jammu and Kashmir’s Samba district alone have tested positive for dengue this month. We don’t have any information about how dengue is affecting civilians in the state. Dengue has been listed as one of the causes for reduced life expectancy for women in urban India, according to a government survey under the Sample Registration System. Joining the thousands stricken by dengue, I too had the kind of towering, crushing fever that makes you rethink your entire existence. The kind that makes your family look like strangers through your fever haze. How bad was yours?
Like you, I too had everyone recommend papaya leaf juice to me. Here is my highly scientific theory on the papaya leaf juice. It tastes gross. You really don’t want to be throwing up on top of everything else you get in dengue. Were you the good kind of patient who just swallowed the papaya leaf juice and hoped for the best? I have nursed three people with dengue using just cold compresses, paracetamol and water. Which makes me sound like the “I can make it with just one small aubergine" woman but you know what I mean. Doctors say that as long as you drink huge quantities of any palatable fluid, you are usually fine. Over the last few years, I have thought of the papaya leaf craze often. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to trace its origins like a meme? Instead, I have seen the belief in the papaya leaf grow from strength to strength and even find a revenue model in companies which have created—don’t laugh— papaya leaf capsules.
Yes, I have had the terrible body pain ever since. What about you? Yesterday, I was in the strange position of having to explain to a cab driver that I was using my hands to lift my legs out of the car not because my skirt was so tight but because my knees didn’t bend. Perhaps I should have had the papaya leaf juice? You think?
Hospitals and doctors can do little to help you when you have dengue except put you on a drip. And we can’t seem to do anything about mosquitoes. Genetically modified mosquitoes released in Brazil to bump off other mosquitoes seem to have agreed to join them instead. Scientists are arguing over the possibility that it has created a “more robust mosquito population". It’s like the ending of a Mani Ratnam movie.
Into this vacuum that nature abhors steps the papaya leaf. Or something else that can make you comfortable, the last priority of the medical system which promises to cure you but not make you feel better. As soon as she heard I had dengue, my friend Brinda, busy with her dance workshop, called. She swore that the juice of night jasmine leaves helped her recover swiftly and without pain from dengue. She was going to get out of class and call a neighbour who had the night jasmine plant to get me some leaves. I, who have spent the last three years loudly making fun of papaya leaves, found myself saying thanks weakly. Another old friend grit her teeth and went to see if the annoying woman next door had night jasmine in her garden. And while these women were on these missions, I hallucinated about bitter potions. Night jasmine was gonna save me, like a new character from the Marvel universe.
And that really is the story of the papaya leaf. It is the closest many of us get to a public health system, that is, your health becomes the property of the public. Dengue is the fever that makes family look like strangers and strangers act like loved ones. So the man delivering groceries, your reserved neighbour, the receptionist at the lab, all ask that question with great kindness and familiarity. If I had told the cab driver, I am sure he too would have asked: papaya leaf juice?

Indulged your appetite this Diwali? Here’s how to get back on trackLike many, Munazza Parande, a city-based chartered accountant, often experiences fatigue and sluggishness after major celebrations, thanks to indulging in unhealthy food and lack of sleep. Last Diwali, she tried her hand at a detox health programme and was pleasantly surprised with the results. “It started with a three-day detox plan, followed by a schedule that involved eating clean and engaged in activities like that addressed factors such as stress. I now follow the same routine after festivals and extensive travel. It makes me feel light, energised and motivated,” says 32-year-old Parande.Parande is one of nutritionist and lifestyle educator Karishma Chawla’s many clients who come to her looking for post-festive crash diet plans. But detoxis not a quick fix, she points out. “It should be done once a month focusing on the gut and liver. But it is best to get awareness of the mind, body and spirit by encompassing meditation, down time, relaxation, nutrition and supplements as well,” Chawla says.According to nutritionist Hetal Chheda, who follows Ayurvedic principles, the 'sharad ritu' (autumn) is an ideal time to remove toxins from one’s body. “Organs like the kidney and the liver do this naturally, but for it to be effective, one needs to give the digestive system a rest from time to time, so the body can use the energy to heal the gut. This can be done at least once in three months by having just juices,” she says. “One can also alternatively eat easy-to-digest foods. A detox regime should be planned well, and can range from a day to a week.” Homemaker Sunayna Joshi says Chheda’s detox regime helps her feel fresh and energetic. “For the first time during Diwali, I didn’t go for a facial because my skin had a natural glow,” she says.Also, it’s vital to know when — to or not — to undertake a detox plan. “It can be detrimental if done for too long, leading to muscle loss and compromising the immunity. Toxins are usually stored in the fat, and so, extreme detox practices can lead to too much toxin release at the same time, which may become overwhelming for the body to handle,” Chawla warns.Nutritionist Kejal Shah prescribes beginning the day with 30 ml fresh aloe vera juice with a glass of water. “This shot is loaded with vitamins, antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties. It hydrates the body, prevent indigestion and reduces inflammation. It is good for gut health and helps detoxify your body,” she says.Green smoothies are a powerhouse of energy that boost digestion and the immune system. Take a handful of spinach and kale leaves, add two sliceseach of apple, pear, peaches, pineapple, half a banana, and a few grapes. Blend these with half a cup of almond milk or yoghurt (a great probiotic), and half a cup ofuntil smooth. Garnish with sunflower seeds. “It cleanses your body, results in clear and healthy skin, aids weight loss naturally, improves hydration and secures the body from free radical damage,” explains Shah.Chawla also recommends consuming high-fibre fruits like apple, pear, orange, sweet, guava, papaya, berries, peach and plums. “These help in stabilisinglevels and are a good source of fibre,” she says. “However, limit your intake up to three a day, and have these preferably before2 pm, to ensure there is no fat gain due to fructose in the fruits.” You can also add a few drops of coconut oil to your vegetable juice and smoothies. “It’s anti-inflammatory and helps calm the system down,” says Chawla.After a series of carbohydrate-rich meals, it’s wise to stick to protein-packed meals for some time. Shah recommends eating moong soup with stir fried greens for lunch. “The high-protein, high-fibre meals make you feel full and fresh for longer. The appetite is satiated for the next two to three hours and the post-festive season cravings get killed,” says Shah. Dinner could be a one-bowl-meal of sprouts, rich in protein, fibre and minerals like potassium, folic acid, calcium and magnesium. “On some nights, you could have two scrambled egg whites. These are full of protein, low in calories and contain essential vitamins to enrich your body,” she adds.Drinking lots of water is of immense importance as it helps flush out the toxins. Shah recommends three litres a day including different variations. Chawla says, “Water can be sipped plain or infused, as coconut water, buttermilk, lime water, kefir, kombucha and herbal teas to get rid of toxins in the body.”Herbal or green tea is another easy way to cleanse your body and load it with antioxidants. “Add basil, lemon, ginger and cinnamon in your tea with a dash of honey for relief from bloating and inflammation in the stomach lining,” says Shah.Shah recommends eating kiwi with a handful pumpkin seeds or a drinking glass of coconut water for mid-morning snacks. “Kiwi is a natural source of antioxidants andand helps in detoxification. Pumpkin seeds are rich in fibre and antioxidants and ensure a healthy gut. Coconut water, along with other nutrients,is the best source for instant hydration and natural sugars,” she says. In the evenings, opt for green tea along with a handful of walnuts, which are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, protein and fibre, she adds.Chawla prefers homemade dressings for salads made with lime juice, skimmed curd, apple cider vinegar, spices and herbs. “Don’t forget to add flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and almonds for their rich omega-3 fats. Seaweed is a healthy substitute for salt and is rich in calcium. The two most effective spices that support detoxification areand turmeric,” she says. Drinks like kefir and kombucha are excellent sourcesof probiotics, while fermented foods such as sauerkraut can help the gut get healthy again.• Begin your day with a glassof lukewarm water mixed with half a lime and a pinch of cinnamon powder.• Then have carrot juice with 1 tsp cold pressed, organic coconut oil, along with one apple/pear/papaya, blended with coconut water and five walnuts.• Breakfast should be a high quality probiotic, a cup of green juice, an orange/sweet lime and a bowl of moong sprouts salad.• Mid- morning, have a fruit.• Five minutes prior to lunch, have a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in lukewarm water.• Lunch can be a bowl of salad of cucumbers, tomatoes and greens with one bowl of methi, palak or dudhi and buttermilk with jeera.

From the pages of Produce Business UK
UK-based produce specialist Wealmoor is developing a line of healthy, plant-based snacks under the Crave Simply brand, and revealed its ambition to demystify papayas in a bid to raise the market penetration of the so-called superfruit. The move forms part of Wealmoor’s intention to gain independent recognition for its brands and the high quality, responsibly-sourced produce they represent.
The grower-packer-distributor of fruits, vegetables and subtropical produce from around the world made the announcements at The London Produce Show and Conference 2019 (LPS19) last week, where the firm sponsored the event’s exclusive Media Masterclass on June 6, 2019.
Launching healthy snacks
“We’re working on an incredibly exciting new venture, using our own manufacturing sites to bring the newly-created craze for plant-based foods to the market in a different way,” revealed Wealmoor CEO, Avnish Malde, who spoke at length about the family-run company’s entrepreneurial and passionate spirit which goes right back to Wealmoor’s founder Rati Dhanani, who pioneered the year-round supply to the U.K. of various global speciality produce types.
“We’ve got the team and the product ranges,” continued Malde. “We’re looking to bring a great tasting, very clean plant-based snacking product to the market. It’s an opportunity to merge some of the plant protein work we’re doing. This is just a flavor of what we’re looking at.”
The Crave Simply line will use rescued produce to minimize waste in the supply chain. The raw, plant-based ingredients are air-dried, rather than being preserved or fried, to create a clean, unprocessed snack that retains more nutrients.
Set for expansion, currently the range includes sweet potato crisps in variety of flavors (cheese and onion, original and salt and pepper) as well as Coconut Bites.
Wealmoor’s Executive Chair Leena Malde told PBUK that the range is the creative vision of the firm’s New Product Development Chef, Enzo di Marino.
“Crave Simply is Wealmoor’s first move away from produce but it is intrinsically involved with fresh produce,” she emphasized. “It’s an opportunity to rescue produce that might have been wasted but is still good quality. You won’t find anything like this on the marketplace at the moment.”
Di Marino explained that Crave Simply is a “healthy, sustainable and nutritious brand”. “The products are air-dried, not fried, which makes the crisps much healthier than normal crisps,” he noted.
Demystifying papayas
Wealmoor also used the occasion of the LPS19 to announce its intention to raise the profile and sales of the humble papaya.
Avnish Malde, together with Paul Tilbury, Head of Fruit at Wealmoor, delivered an in-depth presentation about the papaya trade and the fruit’s virtues. Later Chef Di Marino gave a live demonstration of a papaya risotto, breaded papaya and papaya salad recipe in the LPS19 Chef Demonstration Kitchen.
“We’re really excited about papaya,” exclaimed Malde (Avnish). “It’s understated. It’s a really exciting product for the market, and although we have a long way to go, we feel passionate about bringing it to life.”
Tilbury described the papaya as the “underdog” that no-one knows too much about but with huge potential given the current climate on the U.K. consumer market.
“We estimate that the papaya has a U.K. market value of £13-14 million (m) worth of retail sales, but within that the market penetration probably is no more than about 3% (only 3% of households consume papaya at least once a year), whereas mangoes might be 24% for comparison,” he explained.
Tilbury believes U.K. market penetration could double to 6%, although he admitted there is much work to be done to “demystify this fantastic product” in order to raise its usage among consumers.
In terms of global production, Tilbury estimated that some 12m tonnes of papayas are grown per year, a figure that has risen by 4m tonnes over the last 20 years. For comparison purposes, he pointed out that global banana production falls in the region of 113m-115m tons, apples 80-85m tons and mangoes 50m tons.
“The papaya has a global reach but it’s an underdog,” he pointed out. “If you look at the U.K. market, it is still minuscule.”
When it comes to supply, Wealmoor was keen to emphasize the company’s year-round papaya availability, thanks to its close partnerships with growers around the world – links which go back to when the firm’s founder Dhanani pioneered the first papaya consignment from Brazil to the U.K. in the 1970s.
Today, Wealmoor sources two papaya varieties; Solo Golden from Brazil, and Solo Sunrise from Jamaica and West Africa (Ghana).
“It’s a very difficult crop to grow and export,” explained Tilbury. “It doesn’t need much from the soil but it needs sunlight and warmth (28-32 degrees Centigrade) and it doesn’t like lots of rain or humidity. The plant looks like a giant Brussels sprout, standing at 2.5m-3m high. You harvest probably one to two fruits per plant per week, then you select fruit for export, so you’re down to maybe one fruit per plant per week. It’s very volatile.
“We supply papaya 364 days a year, and that’s a real testament to the passion and commitment of the growers that we work with.”
Having established a supply chain over the last 40 years, Wealmoor believes the time is ripe to champion the papaya and its attributes among U.K. consumers, especially its superfood virtues and versatility of usage.
“It is a changing marketplace,” Tilbury stated. “There is more and more interest in the food that we consume, and what’s good for us. The papaya fits into a lot of those needs. We need to demystify it, and to encourage people to try it and understand its versatility.”
According to Wealmoor, the papaya is a “wonderful eating” superfruit that is full of nutrients (Vitamins A, C, E and K) and antioxidants, with many healthy benefits.
Going all the way back to the 1400s, Tilbury shared the story of Christopher Columbus who hailed the papaya as ‘the fruit of the angels’ after the indigenous people of the Americas recommended eating it to alleviate his indigestion. Tilbury added that super athletes often “bulk up” on papayas before endurance marathons.
Despite being very healthy, Di Marino noted that the papaya is relatively unknown. “Just 100g of papaya gives you 75% of [the recommended intake of] Vitamin C for the day,” he claimed. “You should really eat half a papaya every day!
More than just a breakfast ingredient, Di Marino said the papaya has a unique flavor, meaning it can be used either ripe and raw, or unripe in various cooked dishes. His suggestions included: raw papaya with a squeeze of lime, or cut in half and served with berries, oats and yogurt; and unripe papaya cooked in a curry or risotto, much like a marrow or courgette.
Di Marino revealed that papaya seeds can be used in a variety of ways too; either by drying them to grate or grind in a pepper mill, or eating them raw with a spoon. “Some nutritionists recommend a tablespoon a day,” he advised.
As part of his LPS19 recipe demonstration, Di Marino prepared a papaya mojito to showcase one application of the fruit for the drinks industry. The cocktail comprised papaya, rum, mint, lime, coconut sugar and soda water.
Promoting brands
Furthermore, during the LPS19 Media Masterclass, Wealmoor revealed its ambition to raise the profile of a number of provenance-focused brands created by the company in recent years: Chillifresh, Herbfresh, Love Me Tender and Saxon’s Asparagus.
“We want to get that independent recognition,” Malde (Leena) told PBUK, explaining that the firm supplies most of the U.K.'s retailers and the foodservice sector. “We’ve been happy working behind the scenes but now we feel we need to promote our business.”
Wealmoor has just launched the Saxon’s Asparagus brand for the firm’s own production, which spans 1,000 acres in Suffolk, Shropshire, Evesham and Warwickshire.
“This forms part of an ongoing farming investment; it’s an area we’re really excited about,” Malde (Leena) said. “So far, we have over 500 acres of new asparagus, and ongoing field trials. We’re extending the season with early to late varieties, and trialing varieties for flavor and growing conditions.”
Chillifresh marks another brand that Wealmoor is developing for its year-round own production of various chili pepper varieties in West Africa, Peru and the UK.
“People want a diversity of chilies,” noted Malde (Leena). “Everyone is traveling more, and being more adventurous with their cooking. We’ve had three years with Chillifresh but it’s only been spoken about within our company.”
Herbfresh, meanwhile, is a brand that represents Wealmoor’s own production of a range of herbs that are grown in Surrey during the U.K. summer season, and sold predominately to restaurants and the catering trade.
“Our Herbfresh business covers 1,000 acres in the Thames Valley just down the road [from London],” explained Malde (Avnish). “The provenance of this brand is an amazing story.”
At the premium end of the market, for the last five years Wealmoor has supplied restaurant-quality, responsibly-sourced fresh ingredients under its Love Me Tender brand. Based on provenance, quality, taste and trust, Love Me Tender includes perfectly-ripe mangoes and papayas, aromatic or Japanese stir-fry vegetables and purple sweet potatoes, among other products, and is marketed by U.K. retailers such as Ocado.
Established in 1973, Wealmoor describes itself as a global-local business that handles almost 150 different fresh produce items from around the world, sourcing by road, sea and air from either its own production bases or through close grower partnerships.
Above all, the firm has a reputation for its range of ethnic and exotic produce, as well as producing homegrown seasonal vegetables and herbs. At the heart of everything, Wealmoor actively strives to make a positive impact on the communities and environment wherever it operates.

After a long and stressful day, nutritionists advise that one way to relieve the hassle is by eating a plate of papaya, also known as pawpaw.
The fruit, they say, is rich in several nutrients like vitamin C, which can keep one stress-free.
Private Kamanzi, a nutritionist at Amazon Nutrition Cabinet, a clinic in Kigali that deals with diet, physical wellness and lifestyle, says consuming papaya is essential and improves one’s health.
For instance, he says, this fruit is rich in fibre, vitamin C and antioxidants; which according to him prevent cholesterol build up in one’s arteries.
He explains that when too much cholesterol is built in the body, it can lead to several complications, including heart attack and hypertension.
Losing weight is a goal for some, however, achieving it has always had challenges. Kamanzi says a good way to cut weight is by including papaya in one’s diet.
“Those looking to lose or maintain a healthy weight must include papaya in their diet as it is very low in calories. In fact, the fibre content in it leaves one feeling full and at the same time, clears the bowel movement, making one’s weight loss goals easier,” he says.
Rene Tabaro, a dietician/nutritionist at King Faisal Hospital, says consuming papayas can also help boost immunity.
He says that the immune system acts as a guard against various infections that make one sick. He adds that one papaya contains more than 200 per cent of one’s daily requirement of vitamin C, thus making it great for immunity.
Tabaro says due to today’s lifestyle, many people are developing issues of digestion due to the kind of foods they consume.
He says people have limited time and whenever they get time, they always rush to buy or eat fast food from restaurants, which is normally prepared with a lot of oil.
Kamanzi explains that eating papaya daily can help prevent digestion problems; this is because it has a digestive enzyme known as papain along with fibre, which helps improve the digestive health.
DISEASES AT BAY
Tabaro says in most cases, people who are suffering from diabetes have to watch what they eat and that’s why they are put on a specific diet by nutritionists.
For instance, he says, when they consume both sugary and starchy carbohydrates; it can raise blood sugar levels.
“Papaya is an excellent food option for diabetics as it has a low-sugar content, one shouldn’t be fooled by its sweetness.
Also, people who don’t have diabetes can eat papaya to prevent it from happening,” he says.
Still concerning diseases, Kamanzi says the fruit can decrease the risk of arthritis.
He says arthritis can be a really debilitating disease and people who have it may find their quality of life reduced significantly.
He says eating papaya is good for the bones as they have anti-inflammatory properties which help keep arthritis at bay.
Papaya can also cut the risk of certain cancers. Tabaro says papaya is a rich source of antioxidants, phytonutrients, and flavonoids that prevent the cells from undergoing free radical damage.
He says some studies have linked the consumption of papaya to a reduced risk of colon and prostate cancer.
OTHER BENEFITS
Because of the vitamin A in papaya, Tabaro says it’s a great fruit for the health of the eyes.
He explains that the vitamin A in it helps protect vision from degenerating. One can lose their ability to see due to diseases like age-related macular degeneration. However, he says by eating papaya, it will ensure that one is free from that.
The fruit also prevents signs of ageing.
And who wouldn’t want to stay younger? Tabaro says healthy habits like eating a papaya daily can prolong the process of ageing and may make one look younger than their real age.
He says this is due to vitamin C, vitamin E, and antioxidants like beta-carotene which are abundant in papaya that help prevent the skin from free radical damage, controlling wrinkles and other signs of ageing.
Women who normally experience menstrual pain should turn to papaya because papain helps to regulate and ease the flow, Tabaro says.

Open any social media platform and the chances of getting messages extolling the benefits of papaya are very high. Papaya seeds are good for health, papaya can cure dengue fever, papaya can give glowing skin and thick manes â¦ the list of benefits is pretty long. One message that is doing the rounds is that papaya is the secret behind actor Mammoottyâs youthful looks.
Beyond these tidbits, no one really knows the worth of this large oval sweet fruit that has roots in far off Mexico. But now, papaya in a new avatar is taking Kerala by storm.
The novel papaya tapping will be a boon for rubber farmers who are left in the lurch because of plummeting rubber prices. And everyone is also sceptical on whether rubber will return to its glory days. The rubber farmers can only ruminate over the good old days as price fluctuations, rubber imports and bureaucratic entangles have taken a toll on the market viability of rubber. But the cost-effective papaya tapping is a silver lining for farmers as it is lucrative for them. It is the sap of papaya, like in rubber, that is filling the coffers of the farmers.
It may sound unbelievable, but itâs true. About Rs 25,000 per month could be earned from one acre of papaya tapping. Many farmers in Kerala are toeing the line of their counterparts in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka who had hit a jackpot with papaya tapping. One such Keralite farmer who is into papaya tapping is Ayub Thottolli hailing from Wayanad. And Ayub reveals how to strike gold with papain (papaya sap).
The Mexican touch
âKeralites usually experiment with intercropping, terrace farming and floriculture, and they are interested only in farming thatâs pretty lucrative. The Kerala farmers will get into uncharted waters only if a particular type of farming was a success in some other place. Papaya farming started to make inroads into Kerala only after other states found it raking in the moolah,â says Ayub.
âEveryone will be surprised to know that lakhs of rupees could be earned from the papain tapped from papayas that are thrown away, but initially I too had doubts regarding what will the quantum of income and how farming could be done. I got very interested after realizing that the farming technique was simple,â he recollects the days when he stepped into papaya farming.
It was i-STED (Innovation-Science and Technology based Entrepreneurship Development), an agency under the Department of Science and Technology, which encouraged the farmers to tread this path. This agency was instrumental in making bamboo products and virgin coconut a success.
âI didnât have to think twice to take up papaya farming as i-STED had vouched for it,â adds Ayub.
Papaya trees should be planted where there are good sunshine and less water, and one advantage of papaya farming is that it is conducive to all weather conditions. It is better to cultivate the Philippines variety of âSintaâ papaya as it gives more papain, says Ayub. The CO3 variety can also be tried out.
âThe cultivation of papaya is easy as no special attention is needed for the trees. The fruits will be ready for tapping in six to eight months and as in rubber tapping, tapping of papaya should also be done early in the morning,â he adds.
A good option indeed
âWe harvest papain and there are government approved agencies to collect and store the tapped papain. The farmers will get their share of profit as price and other related clauses are fixed as per the agreement inked with the company that buys papain,â assures Ayub, who earns Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 per month from an acre of papaya cultivation.
Adds a new hue to papaya
Now, the humble papayas transform into something extraordinary. The papain collected from the farmers is made into papain powder. Around 40 kgs of powder are made out of one tonne of papain, and one kg of papain powder can fetch close to Rs one lakh in the global market.
âThese are the number given by the agencies. The actual price will be much more than Rs one lakh,â says Ayub. After tapping, the papayas are sold at Rs 4 per piece to various bakeries as papaya is the main ingredient of many candies.
Value-added products from papaya
Just think again if you have a notion that papaya is just a fruit. Papain powder is one of the main ingredients in the majority of beauty products in the market.
âPapaya is present in creams, powders, medicines and baby powders, and also a vital component of packed meat and gripe water. Papain powder is even included in poultry feed. Another point to be noted is that papain-based products donât have any side-effects,â Ayub adds with utmost confidence.
Ayub is getting plenty of orders after he tasted success in this venture. Moreover, young farmers are keen to meet him to learn the nuances of papaya farming and tapping. Following the footsteps of Ayub and other farmers who made it big in papaya farming, the government is introducing this type of cultivation in various districts. In the first phase, papaya farming had been put in place in Kasaragod, Malappuram, Wayanad, Thrissur, Idukki and Kollam districts. Many farmers from other districts too are expected to take up this novel way of farming. Ayub can be contacted at 9387752145.Â

Story 56
Salmonella infections caused by contaminated papayas highlight the challenges federal officials face in fighting foodborne illness, as a law from nearly a decade ago meant to modernize the food safety system is starting to show its age.
The Food and Drug Administration is trying to bring its efforts to track and prevent outbreaks in line with the technology now at its disposal. But because spending for next year is uncertain, Congress could make it difficult for the agency.
Already this year, the government shutdown delayed most food safety inspections, and during the other four months when the agency was under a continuing resolution, trying to launch new programs was much harder. This fall, the FDA may get a modest funding increase for food safety in fiscal 2020 — or face prolonged flat funding if the budget impasse isn’t resolved.
The papaya outbreak is the latest instance of the FDA issuing a blanket warning against an entire product because officials were unsure where the problem originated. A similar thing happened before Thanksgiving last year when the government warned against eating any romaine lettuce. In both cases, it took a week before consumers got more specific guidance on what brands or locations of origin to avoid.
Frank Yiannas, the head of the FDA’s food safety programs, described “the inability to track and trace foods with speed or precision” as the agency’s “Achilles’ heel.” Part of the problem is that while genomic sequencing technologies make it easier than ever to identify that disparate sicknesses are tied to one outbreak, the infrastructure that would help trace the outbreak to its original source hasn’t been fully developed.
The FDA in April announced a blueprint to modernize the food safety system by looking at ways to increase the use of digital technology in the supply chain. The agency also wants to learn how to better apply artificial intelligence to screenings of imported foods at ports and border crossings, and assess how to handle concerns about the rapidly expanding e-commerce food delivery system.
In short, the food and technology landscape looks different than when Congress wrote the Food Safety Modernization Act in 2010.
“Things have changed a lot since FSMA passed,” Yiannas told CQ Roll Call in May. He said the FDA will continue to work with Congress “so that they understand that there’s a need for continued modernization of our food safety efforts as our food system and society changes.”
Flaws in the system
When the papaya outbreak was originally announced June 28, the FDA didn’t have enough information to pinpoint a source other than Mexico. Officials told consumers and retailers to avoid any papaya imported from the country.
More details eventually came out July 5, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the brand, Cavi, and the distributor that were the likely culprits in the illnesses of 71 people across eight states. The FDA then urged consumers nationwide to avoid the brand.
Yiannas wants to update the food system so tracebacks can be done in seconds, rather than the days or weeks it currently takes. It can take so long because food producers are only required to know the immediate source of a product, and its next stop, not the whole route. Smaller producers may only keep paper records. So when it’s time to trace back a contaminated item, particularly produce or an ingredient in a processed food, it takes time to piece the steps together.
Helping producers shift to digital forms of tracking technologies, like blockchain, could help pinpoint outbreak sources more quickly and eliminate the need for blanket warnings, Yiannas said. The agency hopes lawmakers provide additional funding to back its goals.
“While in today’s systems those broad consumer advisories are absolutely the right thing to do, with better track and trace they wouldn’t have to be so broad and overly prescriptive,” Yiannas said.
Yiannas joined the FDA in November 2018 after running the food safety program for Walmart, the retail giant that is also the largest grocer in the U.S. There, Yiannas implemented digital tracking requirements for producers in the company’s supply chain to ensure that food could be traced back to its source rapidly.
He would like to help the nation’s food system gain the same capabilities, but acknowledges the challenges. The system is extremely fragmented and composed of many small companies that might have a harder time adopting digital tracking methods.
Congress may also be feeling funding fatigue after boosting food safety resources from around $700 million in 2009 to nearly $1.1 billion today. Some lawmakers have concerns about how much progress the FDA has made on FSMA implementation. While most of the new rules that the FDA was supposed to implement after the law’s passage are in place, it wasn’t until this year that the FDA and states began sending inspectors to produce-growing farms. Rules about standards for agricultural water were delayed in 2017 and won’t be in effect for the largest farms until 2022.
Fight for funding
For fiscal 2020, the House is proposing $1.1 billion for the FDA’s food programs, out of a total $5.9 billion budget. That would be around a $40 million increase for food programs compared to fiscal 2019.
Lawmakers are aware of the gaps in traceability. While extra money wasn’t specifically allocated in the report accompanying the House spending bill, appropriators directed the FDA “to work with stakeholders on a wide-scale traceability system that could help companies and government agencies more rapidly access data crucial to tracking foods.”
An increase could help the FDA pursue its goals. The agency’s fiscal 2020 budget request asked for a $52 million overall boost for foods, including $13.3 million to improve the response to outbreaks, which encompasses the traceability efforts.
But House and Senate leaders have yet to agree on topline spending levels for the next fiscal year. While the Senate hasn’t written its appropriations bills yet, it seems poised to start with lower amounts than the House.
As the FDA prods Congress to provide more money and support its goals of using modernized technology, lawmakers have sometimes been frustrated with the agency.
The FDA’s initial response to the papaya outbreak drew criticism from Democratic Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a senior member of the Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, which funds the agency.
She noted the first sign of an outbreak didn’t come from the FDA or CDC but from a fruit and vegetable industry trade publication, which published a story about the outbreak on the morning of June 28. It wasn’t until 3:30 p.m. that the CDC sent its own alert, and the FDA’s came an hour later.
“When it comes to announcing an ongoing outbreak, where consumers potentially have contaminated food in their homes, minutes matter,” DeLauro wrote in a letter to acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless.

The papaya importer named by the Food and Drug Administration as “likely linked” to the Salmonella outbreak that’s sickened more than 70 consumers says it has no role in the outbreak.
A spokesman for Agroson’s LLC, BB #:275358, Bronx, NY, whose Cavi brand papayas the FDA linked to the outbreak, says the FDA demand for a recall “is absurd.”
Scott Davidson with Davidson Law Group, the firm representing Agroson’s, said July 19 that FDA hasn’t been able to link the source of the outbreak to his client or anyone.
“Since July 1, FDA has sampled and released all inbound shipments of Cavi papayas,” he said. “Why should our client recall clean product, especially since an FDA lab found no trace of Salmonella?”
On July 19, FDA released an outbreak update saying despite being linked to the illnesses, “Agroson’s LLC refused to initiate a recall.”
Davidson said a 2017 salmonella outbreak was tied back to the farm in Mexico that Agroson imports from, and he thinks it’s an easy target in this outbreak.
FDA first announced the outbreak June 28, advising consumers to avoid eating all papayas imported from Mexico.
A few days later, Mexican officials challenged the FDA advisory, saying the traceback was inconclusive and no salmonella had been found on any papaya tests.
On July 7, FDA named Agroson’s papayas as the likely source, despite no positive product samples.
Davidson said he’s looking into his client’s options, but a lawsuit against FDA is unlikely.

TEL AVIV, Israel, July 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Papaya Global, a leading automated payroll and workforce management platform, participated in the Visa Everywhere Initiative – Women's Global Edition as the champion of the European region.
This year's competition, held in Paris this month, was open to companies founded by women. Papaya, based in Israel, was co-founded by noted HR and payroll expert Eynat Guez, who serves as the company's CEO.
Papaya won the European competition earlier this year. The final featured six regional representatives in the Fintech Challenge and six in the Social Impact Challenge. Nearly 1,300 companies from 107 countries competed for those final 12 spots. The overall winner of each challenge received a $100,000 cash prize and mentorship directly from Visa.
"We are thrilled that Visa recognized Papaya's ability to facilitate payments at a high level and wanted learn more about our payment process," said Maayan Karstaedt, Product Expert at Papaya Global, who represented the company at the competition in Paris. "The world of payments is changing quickly, and Papaya is perfectly positioned to facilitate payments of all kinds and at all levels."
In addition to pitching Visa on Papaya's services, the event included networking with other finalists and a trip to the Visa sponsored Woman's World Cup taking place in Paris.
Ms. Karstaedt said Papaya is helping solve the problem of scale encountered by many companies looking to build an international workforce.
"They can find the talent. That's never been easier, with 40% of today's workforce working remotely and distributed globally," she said. "But employing and paying them- that's the problem they are facing and we are solving - by dragging payroll – kicking and screaming – to automation and greater efficiency."
Ms. Karstaedt noted that it is already possible to see the first signs of the future of payments - workers will be able to access their earnings on a daily basis rather than have to wait for payday at the end of the month or even every two weeks. But while technology is creating new opportunities, the field of payroll overall is still lagging well behind, resisting changes that could make payroll cheaper, faster, and free of errors.
"Global workforce today is as manual and low-tech today as the transportation industry was just before the Uber revolution," she said. "We are at the cusp of a monumental change. And Papaya is already there, making payroll smarter, simpler, and more secure than ever."
About Papaya Global
Papaya Global provides enterprise with a global, cloud-based SaaS platform to automate payroll and workforce management, an EOR solution to hire workers in over 100 countries, and innovative technology to streamline the payroll process, eliminate errors, and save operating costs.

Die Studien im Detail Vergleichbarkeit fraglich In einer randomisiert-kontrollierten Studie [1] untersuchte eine österreichische Forschungsgruppe die Wirkung eines kommerziell erhältlichen Papaya-Pürees bei Verdauungsbeschwerden. Dazu teilte sie die teilnehmenden Versuchspersonen per Zufall auf zwei Gruppen auf. Eine Gruppe erhielt ein Papaya-Püree, die andere Gruppe zum Vergleich ein Placebo-Püree ohne Papaya, das gleich aussah und schmeckte. Beide Gruppen nahmen die vorportionierten Pürees täglich 40 Tage lang ein; sie wussten nicht, ob sie in der „echten“ oder in der Placebo-Gruppe waren. Welche Verdauungsbeschwerden die Teilnehmenden genau hatten, ist in der Publikation nicht erwähnt. Jeweils zu Studienbeginn und zu Studienende schätzten die Teilnehmenden für 22 unterschiedliche Symptome (wie zum Beispiel Durchfall, Verstopfung oder Bauchschmerzen) ein, ob und wie stark sie sich jeweils betroffen fühlten. Die Daten lassen darauf schließen, dass in der Studie Versuchspersonen mit sehr unterschiedlichen Beschwerden teilnahmen und daher nicht miteinander vergleichbar waren. Selbst die Anzahl der Teilnehmenden bleibt unklar. An einer Stelle schreiben die Autoren von 139 Menschen zu Studienbeginn, von denen 126 die gesamte Studie durchliefen. An anderer Stelle ist nur von 84 Personen die Rede. Fehleranfällige Analyse Die Forscher führten für jedes der 22 Symptome einen Vergleich durch. Bei einem Teil der Versuchspersonen aus der Papaya-Gruppe waren die Symptome „Verstopfung“, „schmerzhafter Stuhlgang“ und „Blähungen“ häufiger zurückgegangen als in der Placebo-Gruppe. Doch diese Ergebnisse sind aus unserer Sicht nicht geeignet, um die Wirksamkeit des Papaya-Pürees zu belegen: Die Resultate beruhen nur auf einem kleinen Teil der Teilnehmenden, während der Großteil nicht in die Analyse eingeschlossen wurde.
Sie berücksichtigen nicht, ob sich die Symptome nur geringfügig oder stark gebessert haben.
Bei 22 verschiedenen Vergleichen ist aufgrund des mehrfachen Testens eines Datensatzes die Wahrscheinlichkeit groß, dass sich bei zumindest einem davon ein rechnerischer „Unterschied“ zeigt. Dieser existiert aber in Wirklichkeit gar nicht und entsteht bei der Auswertung zufällig. Insgesamt ist die Auswertung lückenhaft und nicht nachvollziehbar. Zudem ist fraglich, ob die stark unterschiedlichen Beschwerden der Teilnehmenden überhaupt einen sinnvollen Vergleich erlauben. Papaya und Hafer gegen Gastritis Eine zweite randomisiert-kontrollierte Studie [2] untersuchte die Wirkung einer kommerziell erhältlichen Kombination aus Papaya-Püree und Hafer. In dieser Studie nahmen 60 Betroffene mit chronischer Gastritis teil. Wieder wurden die Teilnehmenden per Zufall in zwei Gruppen eingeteilt. Eine nahm 30 Tage lang das Kombinationspräparat ein, die andere ebenso lange ein Placebo-Präparat ohne Papaya und Hafer. Ob die beiden Gruppen in Hinblick auf Symptomschwere und andere Merkmale vor Studienbeginn ähnlich und somit vergleichbar waren, berichtet die Studie nicht. In der Publikation wird erwähnt, dass einige Teilnehmende Medikamente gegen zu viel Magensäure einnahmen. Ob dies in einer Gruppe häufiger oder in höherer Dosierung vorkam als in der anderen, bleibt unerwähnt. Waren die beiden Gruppen zu Beginn aufgrund von deutlichen Unterschieden nicht vergleichbar, so kann dies die Ergebnisse verzerrt haben. Fragwürdige Auswertung Für 11 verschiedene Merkmale (beispielsweise Übelkeit, Schmerzen oder Einfluss der Beschwerden auf den Alltag) verglichen die Forscher die Papaya-Hafer-Gruppe mit der Placebo-Gruppe. Personen, bei denen bestimmte Merkmale nicht aufgetreten waren, schlossen sie aus der Analyse aus. Für keines der 11 Merkmale zeigte sich nach Behandlungsende ein Unterschied zwischen beiden Gruppen. Nur durch die Zusammenfassung der beiden Symptome „Schmerzintensität“ und „Einfluss der Beschwerden auf den Alltag“ zeigte sich rechnerisch ein geringerer Wert in der Papaya-Hafer-Gruppe. Auch hier gilt jedoch: je mehr Vergleiche man rechnet, umso höher ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Zufallsfund, der im echten Leben gar keine deutlich spürbare Verbesserung für die Betroffenen bedeutet. Auch in dieser Studie fehlen wichtige Angaben und Daten, um die Ergebnisse nachvollziehen zu können. Sie ist für uns keine Basis für Rückschlüsse zur Frage, ob Papayas bzw. Substanzen daraus in Kombination mit Hafer bei chronischer Gastritis helfen können.

Food and pregnancy go together like pickles and ice cream, so it stands to reason that as you’re nearing the end of your pregnancy, you might turn to food to induce labor — especially because many moms claim that the last thing they ate before giving birth was the thing that kickstarted contractions.
“I was two days shy of my due date and my older sister, who already had three children of her own, wanted to help speed things up, so she stopped by with a small container of Chinese food — I believe it was sesame chicken and pork fried rice," says Annamaria W. from Manorville, New York. "She'd heard that it may help get things started. That night I went into labor, and the next morning, I delivered my daughter one day early!"
Jennifer Guido, from Ramsey, New Jersey, swears it was the eggplant parmesan from Lotito’s Deli & Bakery in Ramsey that got her labor going. “When I was pregnant with my son, I went into labor a few days early — the night after having it for lunch,” she explains. “When I was pregnant with my daughter, I was days late. I’m a very science-minded person, but I was feeling desperate and willing to try anything! I read online that some restaurants claim to have labor-inducing eggplant parm. Then I remembered that I had it just before labor with my first, so I got some, ate it, went into labor that night, too!" Eggplant parm isn't the only dish that restaurants claim will do the trick: California's Caioti Pizza Cafe, for example, has a "Maternity Salad" on its menu that's a local legend for moms-to-be.
But does any of this really work? Sorry, moms-to-be: Adam Huggins, M.D., associate professor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, says, “There is no empirical evidence that different foods can induce labor. However, there are lots of anecdotal stories of patients that went into labor after having a particular food or drink.”
And just like those above, we’ve heard the stories: Whether it’s a spicy meal or certain ingredients, like papaya, we can all likely name someone who swears that it helped kick-off their labor. “I think it’s only natural that women want to use something that they have some control over, whether it’s the food they eat or an herb that they take, to help give them control over this normal part of their pregnancy,” says Anna Graseck, M.D., assistant professor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.
There's no research that shows that eggplant, papaya, or spicy foods induce labor.
If you scour the message boards, and you'll find a list of foods that supposedly get things going: spicy food, papaya, dates, pineapple, eggplant, etc — But have there been any actual studies?
There’s been some research on dates, Dr. Graseck says. A small study out of Jordan found that women who ate six dates a day in the month leading up to their due date went into labor on their own more often, and were more dilated once they were admitted for delivery. In their abstract, researchers concluded, “the consumption of date fruit in the last 4 weeks before labour significantly reduced the need for induction and augmentation of labour." But before you start stockpiling dates, the researchers also admitted that more studies were needed — and that was back in 2011, so even those preliminary results might be out-of-date by now. Dr. Graseck notes that eating six dates a day isn’t exactly easy, either. “You can certainly try it, but it may not be very appealing,” she says.
When it comes to pineapple, Neetu Sodhi, D.O., M.P.H., an OB/GYN with Providence Tarzana Medical Center in Tarzana, California, says that an enzyme in the core —“known to be a good meat tenderizer” — is thought to make the cervix soften, but “that doesn’t happen.” Another choice? Papaya. “The enzyme papain in papaya is thought to release prostaglandins and oxytocin — actual compounds that induce labor — but that also doesn't happen.”
In general, she says, with many of these commonly recommended tricks, like spicy food, it’s really the stomach upset that’s at the heart of it more than any specific enzyme or compound. "Sometimes with GI upset, you’ll get activation of uterine cramping and/or contractions,” she says. "But those don’t lead to labor unless your body was already ready for labor.”
Doctors say you can really, really skip the castor oil.
With most of these foods, even if there's no science to back them up, there's no harm in giving them a shot, particularly if you’re past the 39-week mark and not high risk. "Patients in general are welcome to try them,” Dr. Huggins says, “but we can't say for sure it will be successful.”
But there's another commonly referenced ingredient that doctors say to steer clear of: castor oil. “We would not recommend castor oil,” Dr. Huggins says. “While it's safe, it has not been proven to lead to the starting of labor. More importantly, the significant cramping and diarrhea it can cause can be very uncomfortable.” The diarrhea can also cause dehydration.
Both Dr. Graseck and Dr. Sodhi also caution against using certain herbs, like blue or black cohosh, which may be unsafe. Also, it’s smart to stick to the same food safety guidelines you’ve been employing throughout your pregnancy to avoid those that might cause food-borne illness. And don’t try any labor-inducing techniques unless you’ve reached 39 weeks, if you’re having a high-risk pregnancy, or have had a past C-section, experts say.
“In general, if a woman has a specific food or drink she'd like to try, it’s always best to discuss with her provider first,” Dr. Huggins recommends. “While most of these products are perfectly safe in pregnancy, consultation with a provider is always recommended.” Your OB or midwife knows you and your pregnancy well, he says, and can offer up choices for you specifically.
But the bottom line? Take all the waiting for labor as a good parenting lesson on how we only have so much control over our children, Dr. Graseck advises. “When your body and your baby are ready, that’s when you’re going to go into labor,” she says.

Lance Peterson just likes to put a face to the voice.
“The Fresh Summit show is a way for us to see customers and help match those voices on the phone with faces,” says Lance Peterson of Pharr, Tex.-based Super Starr International. “And it’s not only seeing our customer base but it’s seeing people in the industry. You run into a lot of people at the show and we all have similar issues and sometimes it’s good to just talk about what’s happening in the industry.”
At this year’s Fresh Summit 2019, taking place in Anaheim, Ca. October 17-19, Super Starr will have on display three papaya varieties: the traditional maradol; a hybrid marketed under Super Starr papaya; and a Royal Star Variety that’s exclusive to Super Starr to distribute in the U.S. and Canada. “The hybrid particularly is starting to take off a bit because there have been some issues with maradols not holding up during the rainy season,” says Peterson. “The hybrid is an alternative rather than a complete replacement but we’re also working on finding a better maradol.”
Super Starr's Royal Star papaya variety.
Slim availability
Right now, Peterson notes that supplies of papaya are in fact tight coming into North America.
“The growers haven’t been doing very well and prices over the last couple of years have been low typically,” says Peterson, who notes supplies come from Colima, Mexico. “Producers weren’t making money. So people started cutting back on their papaya programs.”
While he estimates that supplies have been tight for about two months now, demand has also been on the slow side more recently. “Usually at this time of year, it is slow,” says Peterson. “But a couple of weeks ago, demand was very good and in the past 10 days, it dampened and has slowed down.”
He does however anticipate demand will start to pick up in the coming weeks. “Last year prices at this time were anywhere from $12-$14 and right now it’s hanging around $18,” he says.

In Europe, papaya consumption isn't yet as common as in tropical countries, but it is growing gradually.
A report from the Center for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries (CBI), gave those exporting papayas to the Old Continent a list of the qualities they should strive for in their products. They should be clean, pesticide-free, without abnormal external moisture, odorless, with a firm texture, without signs of damage by high or low temperatures and with a stem that doesn't exceed 1 centimeter in length.
It is acknowledged that papayas are difficult to handle due to the fruit's relatively short shelf life and delicacy, since the fruit is easily bruised.
Growing market
The CBI points out that after several years in which the European import of papayas remained at 30 thousand tons, the figure grew to 40 thousand tons in 2015 and 2016. Already in 2017 the volume reached 43 thousand tons worth 103 million Euro. "This shows that more and more consumers are becoming familiar with papayas. Virtually all papaya imports arriving in Europe come from developing countries," he says.
The entity explains that Germany and the Netherlands are the main importers of fresh papayas, and they are also the ones recording the highest growth levels. A good part of the German imports are made through the Netherlands (70% of the papayas that enter this country are re-exported), which explains the high figures of both countries. Portugal and Spain also import large quantities. In the former's case, it is due to its historical ties with Brazil, the largest exporter of papayas. However, the volumes are still low in the countries of Eastern Europe.
In order to try exporting papayas to the European continent, the commercial promotion institution recommends looking for varieties and technical improvements that facilitate the transport of this delicate fruit. A good example is the Original Brazilian papaya, which has a longer shelf life and greater resistance to diseases. Gaining experience in papaya ripening at destination will also help stimulate the demand for ready-to-eat presentations.
The main varieties in the European market are currently the Sunrise and Golden Solo for small sizes of up to 700 grams, and the Formosa for those that exceed one kilo. Consumers tend to prefer the smaller ones, especially in north-western Europe.
There are also opportunities in the organic papayas.

Papaya farming:
Papaya is known as a “carica”, around the world. It is native to the tropical region America mostly Mexico and Costa Rica. Papaya has a special importance due to its high nutritive and medical value.
In the hill station, Mizoram, Tripura and Manipur are the highest production area of the papaya. It is the fifth most commercially yield in India. Around the world, a total of around 6 million tonnes papaya is produced annually. India is the leader in papaya cultivation, annual output of papaya in India is around 3 million tonnes. Some other leading producers are Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, China, Thailand, Nigeria and Philippines.
What are the varieties of Papaya in Papaya farming?
Honey dew:
It is dioecious with less percentage of male plant and breeds true to the type from seed, semi tall variety, bare fruits low on the trunk heavily. Interestingly, this variety is popular all over India, and is also called as Madhu Bindu.
Sunrise solo:
It is named as ‘solo’ as one man can easily consume one fruit. This variety is from Hawaii with small sized fruits, pyriform and yellowish orange pulp. Its keeping quality is also good.
Coorg honey dew:
The variety produces no male plants. Its plants are either hermaphrodite or female. Fruits borne on female plants are almost seedless and are of excellent quality.
Washington:
These plants are vigorous, stem and leaf stalks are with purple ting, fruits medium to large, round to ovate, sweet, pulp orange color with good flavor.
State wise varieties of papaya:
Andhra Pradesh: Honey Dew, Coorg Honey Dew, Washington, Solo, Co-1, Co02, Co-3, Sunrise Solo, Taiwan.
Karnataka & Kerala: Coorg Honey Dew, Coorg Green, Pusa Delicious & Pusa Nanha.
Jharkhand: Ranchi Selection, Honey Dew, Pusa Delicious & Pusa Nanha.
West Bengal: Ranchi Selection, Honey Dew, Washington, Coorg Green.
Orissa: Pusa Delicious, Pusa Nanha, Ranchi Selection, Honey Dew, Washington, Coorg Green.
Details of Propagation in Papaya farming:
The papaya seeds must be collected from healthy ripe fruits essentially from the plants which are free from pest and diseases. This fruit is usually propagated by seeds. Also, the seeds should be rubbed with ash to remove mucilaginous coating (Aril/Sarcotesta) to facilitate better germination.
But, seeds can be stored for 45 days in an air tight container and stored at 100C. Before sowing, soaking seeds in 100ppm GA solution to enhance germination percentage.
What is the Sowing Process for Papaya farming?
Papaya Seeds can be sown in poly bags (22x15cm with 150 gauges) 6 weeks prior to transplanting. The media should be disinfected by using 2 % formalin solution, 4 seeds per polybag should be sown, if it is dioecious variety or 2 seeds, or if it is hermaphrodite variety.
Seeds are also sown in raised nursery beds. Around 350 g seeds are needed to plant one hectare area.
Germination can take place in 2-3 weeks after sowing. About 6-7 weeks old seedlings are ready for transplanting.
Climate & Soil Requirements for Papaya farming:
One must know that papaya is susceptible to frost. It is tropical in its climatic requirement.
Papaya plant requires warm humid climate and can be cultivated up to an elevation of 1000-1200 m above MSL.
It thrives well at temperature between 38-440C, and optimum range is 22-360C, with a day temperature of 350C and 250C night temperature are most suitable.
It requires fertile soil, deep clayey and calcareous and rocky soils are not suitable and grows well under well drained soil with a pH range of 6-7.
When is the Best Planting Season for papaya crop?
The best season is monsoon (June-July) for papaya planting. You can also do planting in Spring time (February-March) and Autumn (October-November). However, Monsoon is the best season for it.
Spacing between Two Papaya plants in Papaya farming:
Papaya plantation requires the pit size of 1-1.5 cubic feet digging at 1.8 x 1.8m or at 2.4 x 2.4m apart and filled with 30-40 kg FYM with 25gm aldrin 5 % dust will be added to the pits and filled with top soil.
High Density Planting:
For Papaya High Density plantation the pit size of 1-1.5 cubic feet should be dug at 1.2 x 1.2m and filled with 30-40 kg FYM with 25gm aldrin 5 % dust will be added to the pits and filled with top soil.
Flowering in Papaya Farming
In Papaya farming, flowering starts in 5-6 months after planting process. When the sex of the plant is identified, surplus male plants (plants with long 1-11/2 meters flower stalk hang out with small tubular flowers contains stamens only), may be removed keeping one male plant for every 10 female plants, as pollinizers. Remove male plants and maintain1 male plant for every 10 plants after flowering.
Inter Cropping and Inter Cultivation in Papaya Farming:
One can do inter coping in papaya farming. Firstly, grow different short duration vegetables for about six months from planting papaya plants.
Water Irrigation in Papaya farming:
You can use Ring irrigation system for papaya farming. For such a system, irrigate papaya plant in 8-10 days in winter and 6 days in summer.
Harvesting and Storing Papaya:
The average yield is 30-80 tons/ha.
Papaya comes to bearing with 10 months after planting. However, the economic life is only 3-4 years. Fruits are harvested when the fruit turn slight yellow in colour. While harvesting, fruit must not be damaged to prevent rotting. Manual harvesting is commonly practiced.
After that wash the fruits with water or fungicide and pack in boxes with cushioning materials.
After harvesting in about 5-6 days fruit ripens depending upon room temperature. Fruits cannot be stored for more than 4-5 weeks at 00C, and individual fruits are wrapped in the newspaper for ripening
Papain Extraction:
Papain is a proteolytic enzyme which is extracted from the milky latex obtained from immature papaya. Around 400 tons of papain is produced throughout the world. The USA and UK are the major consumers of papain.
Procedure: The immature fruits of 90-100 days old are used for extraction of milky latex by giving 4-6 cuts of about 2mm depth, the latex is collected from 5-6 tapping and sieved the latex and dried in sun or in vacuum shelf dryer. The quality and grade of papain is determined by color and enzyme activity (Tyrosine unit).
Post Harvesting and Storage:
Once harvesting is done, the fruits are graded on the basis of their weight, size and colour. Fruits are highly perishable in nature. Papaya can be stored for a period of 1-3 weeks at a temperature of 10-130 C and 85-90% RH.
Plant Protection and Diseases management:
Mite incidence can be occasionally noted especially during summer. Few insects such as scales, mealy bugs, aphids and thrips have been reported infesting the fruit tree. Scale insects and mealy bugs on stem and leaves are also observed.
Diseases:
Anthracnose (colletotrichumgloesporiodes)
Powdery Mildew (Oidiumcaricae)
Caller rot and wilt
Nematodes Root knot (Meloidogyne Sp)
Viral Diseases:
Mosaic
Leaf curl
Ring spot
Among these, the papaya ring spot virus is common in North India, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and it has also become a major threat to papaya production in several tracts.

A luminescent neon pink sign lights up the corner of 300 South and State Street. Standing out among its Salt Lake City neighbors, Ginger Street welcomes you with fanny packs, community tables, outdoor seating and its loud neon sign. New to downtown as of June 20, Ginger Street is serving hawker-style street food — not only is the food different to the Salt Lake area, but the restaurant itself can make you feel like you aren’t in Salt Lake anymore. In more ways than one, Ginger Street will push you out of your comfort zone.
The Ingredients
Upon walking up to the door, you can see everything happening on the inside. A large screen streams video of hawker-style cooking in Southeast Asia and the calm, ambient lighting brings an easygoing vibe. Yet, standing out among the general ambiance, are the people. After being greeted by the kind host, quick and pleasant service followed. Employee Ivy Watrous, and restaurant manager and owner Michael McHenry, ensured that every aspect of the meal, down to the paper straws on the table, were perfect. Ginger Street is run by a team of collaborators and people who genuinely want to create a friendly and communal atmosphere.
On the wall a quote reads: “Real food for the people.” Chef and business partner, Tyler Stokes worked to create what could be classified as a perfect hawker-style street food menu. Hawker-style was described by Watrous as what most of us would refer to as tapas style. Food comes as soon as it’s done. There is no waiting for the full order or the appetizer. All dishes are family style, further allowing this system to work, and yet another way McHenry can encourage community. The base flavors for the food are from Southeast Asia, where street food is sold based upon each business’ specialty. It is the job of the consumer to create their own mash-up of different dishes and styles to create their favorite and most fulfilling meal. “Everything we do we can stamp with ‘real,'” McHenry says. Ginger Street has nothing to hide about its locally-sourced food. The open kitchen hides nothing, the real flavors prove the food can be trusted.
I sat in the center of the restaurant at a table meant for fifteen. At first, I wondered why the host would sit us at such a large table. McHenry said, “People have got to learn how to sit next to others.” He shared how he had a passion to ensure people would converse. He said, “If I could have a bucket for cell phones, I would have one in the middle of the table.” This idea and culture of talking to random people you are sat next to is not common in Salt Lake City and McHenry has noticed the difference. He’s trying to get one step closer to initiate important and intentional conversation.
With the restaurant’s focus on conversation, you might think that the music would take a bit of a hit. On the contrary, Ginger Street has a live DJ Thursdays through Sundays who spins vintage vinyl. You can hop on over to experience ’90s jams, disco, house hip-hop and more. The music attracts visitors both young and old, creating a fun and easy atmosphere.
In keeping with the Hawker style, Ginger Street serves a wide mix of dishes. They have a yellow curry, steamed berkshire pork dumplings, green papaya salad, dry fried green beans and much more. I found the flavors to be a bit spicy, but still wholesome. The food will leave you feeling full, but not bloated and uncomfortable. The servers and kitchen also work to accommodate allergies and preferences of food by modifying for vegan and gluten needs.
Many of the dishes initially struck me as confusing and eccentric. But, upon eating them, the flavors just naturally flow and work in some miraculous way. Chef Stokes knows his combinations and has truly succeeded at putting them together. This doesn’t just apply to food, but the drinks as well. There are both virgin and spiked drinks available and many other options ranging from natural wines to iced Vietnamese coffee.
In addition, the menu remains surprisingly affordable. The dinner menu ranges from about $10 to $15 — reasonable for college students. There is also a lunch menu available, and McHenry put together a suggested combo of a Pabst Blue Ribbon “Extra” and their sinfully remarkable Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich for only $11. Best of all — lunch food is guaranteed in six minutes or less.
The Verdict
I had been contemplating about visiting Ginger Street since its opening, worried my daydream of what is was would be ruined. But, from the moment of entrance to the second I stepped out of the door, I could not have asked for one thing to be better. The engaging customer service kept me comfortable, calm and gave me an overwhelming feeling of being accepted and taken care of. The atmosphere supported my community of friends I brought with me and the conversation was real. All the food was absolutely delicious. The last bite of Ginger Street’s magic for me was their famous desert — The G-Bar. Unfortunately, I can’t dare to explain to you what it tastes like. As Watrous said, “You’ll know what it is when you have it.”
“We are working to have an environment which is as exciting and flavorful as the food on the table,” said McHenry. It’s safe to say they’ve reached this goal. Food lovers far and wide have my full recommendation to try Ginger Street. Not only will it push you to break away from everyday life, but it will fill you with delicious food while you’re at it.
Special Recommendations
Be sure to try the Curry Special. Its perfect mixture of apples, sweet potatoes, shrimp and white rice can not be beat. A close second would be the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. This delectable phenomenon comes on a brioche bun, topped with green papaya slaw, tomatoes, jalapeño, kewpie mayo and a spicy breaded chicken patty.

ST. JOHN — New York couple John and Sarah Joyce recently quit their jobs and followed their dream of moving to the Caribbean to open a restaurant. The Danforth, a Caribbean-inspired restaurant serving seafood and local cuisine is located on the waterfront in Coral Bay. It will have its grand opening on Friday, according to a release issued Tuesday.
Originally from Brooklyn, NY, Sarah and John Joyce left behind the stability of successful careers, the comfort of a lovingly restored fixer-upper, and the support of close-knit families to live the dream of becoming restaurateurs on the tiny island of St. John.
“Millions of people dream about quitting their job and moving to a tropical island but very few people actually do it. The last 8 months have been quite the adventure,” said owner, Sarah.
John and Sarah Joyce
The Danforth takes its name from a common type of boat anchor and the name fits perfectly with the vibe of the restaurant, which serves upscale food in a casual, family friendly setting. “We want diners to feel fully immersed in the Caribbean experience,” said owner, John. “To us that means indulging in the highest quality Caribbean food, listening to local music, and enjoying a breathtaking view. All without having to dress up for the occasion.”
“Food is a huge part of Caribbean culture and we have always felt that local cuisine was underrepresented in the St. John dining scene. Our goal at The Danforth is to create a unique culinary experience where you can indulge your senses in Caribbean flavors, sights, and sounds,” added Sarah.
In the kitchen, Executive Chef, Gil Turturici, who is known for seamlessly blending local cuisines with modern cooking techniques, has created a refined selection of dishes that highlight the best flavors of the Caribbean.
“Our menu was created by drawing inspiration from the vibrant flavors found in traditional Caribbean dishes and elevating them using the freshest local ingredients. The result is an unparalleled dining experience; it is unlike any other on St. John,” Turturici said.
The restaurant is situated on the waterfront in Coral Bay. The view from the dining room is unsurpassed; sailboats rock gently in the harbor, donkeys amble down the road, and tribes of goats chew grass at the water’s edge. It feels tranquil and undiscovered and it is the perfect spot for an unforgettable meal, according to the release.
The restaurant will be open daily for happy hour from 3pm-6pm at the large outdoor bar overlooking Coral Bay. The happy hour menu includes fun, shareable dishes like lobster tostones and fresh sushi rolls. More adventurous diners can try crispy Fungi Fries (Caribbean polenta fries) or local Saltfish Ceviche. The cocktail menu is full of island inspiration including a drink called the Peter Bay, which blends island celebrity, Kenny Chesney’s Blue Chair Rum with mango and fresh lime juice, for a bright tropical flavor.
Dinner service runs from 5pm-9pm and features creative dishes with a heavy Caribbean influence. Live Caribbean lobster, fresh mahi mahi, and grouper are brought in from the sea every day and feature prominently on the menu. Entrees like Braised Oxtail and Pepper Shrimp are complimented by local sides dishes like savory plantain mash and mofongo. While island fruits like ripe mango, papaya, and pineapple add a delicious finish to every dish.
The nightly dining experience is made complete through live performances by local musicians playing reggae, soca, and beach music.

Kottakkal: One more species has been added to the Asian papaya family from the Western Ghats. The new hairy variety of papaya has been discovered from Kotagiri forests in Tamil Nadu. The research team led by senior scientist Dr. K. M. Prabhukumar and director Dr. Indira Balachandran of the Department of Taxonomy at the Centre for Medicinal Plants Research of Arya Vaidya Sala in Kottakkal discovered the new plant.
The plant was first noticed by Dr. Prabhukumar while he was on a research about the rare plants in Nilgiri forests. Dr. Prabhukumar said that the major difference of the new papaya is the hairs on its leaves and stems. It is for the first time this papaya variety is discovered in an Asian forest.
There is no empty space inside the fruit like the ordinary papaya. When the flower is cut vertically, five layers can be seen at the bottom of it whereas only a single layer can be found in ordinary papaya flower. The flowers are light yellow in colour.
Dr. Indira Balachandran said that all the internal structure of the new papaya is different from the ordinary kind. The new plant grows up to a height of 35 feet. The fruits are smaller than ordinary papaya variety and are less than 15 cm in size. It grows at an altitude of 4900-9800 feet.
It has been confirmed that the plant is mountain papaya or highland papaya, scientifically named as Vasconcellea pubescens, which is commonly found in Ecuador. Mountain papaya is one of the major agricultural crops in the South American countries Chile, Columbia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela.
As mountain papaya is less sweet than normal papaya, it is more suitable for making jam, juice and sweet snacks than consuming directly. This papaya is also a rich source of Vitamin C and A and potassium. The enzyme papain contained in the fruit is used for making medicines.

It is said Columbus once referred to papaya as the fruit of the angels. It is an incredibly healthy tropical fruit that is loaded with antioxidants and vitamin that can reduce inflammation, fight diseases and helps you keep looking young.
Its sweet taste, vibrant color, and the wide variety of health benefits make it a popular fruit to include in your diet. Besides, it contains an enzyme called papain, which can break down the tough protein chains found in muscle meat. Because of this, people have used papaya to tenderize meat for thousands of years.
To give you an idea of its nutritional value, it may be mentioned that one small papaya of roughly 152 grams contains – Calories: 59 grams, Carbohydrates: 15 grams, Fiber: 3 grams, Protein: 1 gram, Vitamin C: 157% of the RDI, Vitamin A: 33% of the RDI, Folate (vitamin B9): 14% of the RDI, Potassium: 11% of the RDI along with traces of calcium, magnesium and vitamins B1, B3, B5, E and K.
Here are some of its top health benefits.
Improves bone health: Low intakes of vitamin K have been associated with a higher risk of bone fracture. Adequate vitamin K consumption is important for good health as it improves calcium absorption and may reduce urinary excretion of calcium, meaning there is more calcium in the body to strengthen and rebuild bones.
Prevents signs of ageing: Papaya is rich in vitamin C, vitamin E and antioxidants like beta-carotene which helps prevent your skin from free radical damage keeping wrinkles and other signs of ageing at bay. Healthy habits such as eating a papaya a day will delay ageing and will make you look younger than you really are.
Diabetes and immunity: Your immunity system acts as a guard against various diseases that can make you sick. A single papaya contains more than 200% of your daily requirement of Vitamin C, making it great for your immunity. One small papaya also provides about 3 grams of fiber, which is equivalent to just 17 grams of carbohydrates. Studies have shown that people with type 1 diabetes who consume high-fiber diets have lower blood glucose levels, and people with type 2 diabetes may have improved blood sugar, lipid, and insulin levels.
Protects against arthritis: Eating papayas are good for your bones as they have anti-inflammatory properties along with Vitamin C which prevents different forms of arthritis from attacking the body. A study published in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases showed that people who consumed foods low in Vitamin C were three times more likely to have arthritis than those who didn’t.
Helps improve digestion: Papayas contain an enzyme called papain that aids digestion; in fact, it can be used as a meat tenderizer. Papaya is also high in fiber and water content, both of which help to prevent constipation and promote regularity and a healthy digestive tract. In one study, people who took a papaya-based formula for 40 days had significant improvement in constipation and bloating. The seeds, leaves and roots have also been shown to treat ulcers in animals and humans.

NAAWAN, Misamis Oriental (MindaNews / 27 July) — As Dengue rears its ugly head and spreads in near epidemic proportion across the nation, it’s high time we take a deeper look on traditional or customary cure in the absence of big pharma drug to combat the disease.
The folklore herbal medicine against dengue, Tawatawa tea and Papaya leaves extract should not be dismissed or even belittled after all.
Tawa-tawa (Euphorbia hirta), also known as “gatas-gatas,” is a hairy herb that grows naturally in open grasslands, backyards, roadsides and pathways.
A study conducted by UST pharmacy students, published in the Journal of Tropical Medicine, showed that tawatawa contains small amount of phenolic compound sufficient to exert effect in promoting quality and quantity of platelets,” Based on the results of their experiment, the researchers concluded that administering tawa-tawa decoction to animal models help improve their healing mechanism. Tawa-tawa was able to promote cell production, and prevents platelet destruction. Likewise, the improvement in the cell bleeding time and clotting time provided evidence that the indigenous plant can preserve and promote the hemostatic function of platelets.
On the other hand, a study in Pakistan on dengue fever treatment with papaya (carica) leaves extracts was also published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.
In the study, a 45 year old feverish (40 C) truck driver bitten by an Aedes aegypti mosquito did not respond to broad spectrum of antibiotic and anti malarial drugs. Three to four patients in the hospital who showed the same symptoms already died. A team of researchers from Peshawar University that was studying at that time on the chemical properties of Carica papaya considered the victim for a papaya treatment case study.
In the treatment, plant material was washed with water, cut into pieces and grinded with blender. 25 mL of aqueous extract of C. papaya leaves was administered to patient infected with Dengue fever. The same dose was given to the patient twice daily i.e. morning and evening for five consecutive days. The patient’s platelet increased after the papaya treatment, avoided bleeding complication and survived.
The laboratory analysis of papaya leaves extract showed that it contains two important biologically active compounds namely: chymopapain and papain which are widely used for digestive disorders. It showed that papaya-derived papain, caricain, chymopapain, and glycine endopeptidase can improve acidic pH conditions and pepsin degradation. Other active compounds of C. papaya are lipase, or CPL, a hydrolase, which is tightly bonded to the water-insoluble fraction of crude papain and is thus considered as a “naturally immobilized” biocatalyst. Said compounds increase platelets and prevent platelet destruction, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
The different chemical properties of papaya also show, accordingly, promise as a strong natural candidate against viral diseases.
Indeed, despite the absence of mechanism or explanation on how they work, traditional beliefs and customs have proven their efficacy in addressing modern maladies.

A CDC food safety alert for an outbreak of Salmonella infections linked to papayas imported from Mexico has been posted at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/uganda-06-19/index.html.
Key points:
CDC, FDA, and public health and regulatory officials in several states are investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Uganda infections linked to whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico.
Do not eat, serve, or sell whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico or food that contains papaya from Mexico in these states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.
62 ill people have been reported from eight states ( Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Texas.)
23 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.
Of 33 ill people with available information, 22 reported being of Hispanic ethnicity.
The hospitalization rate in this outbreak is 66 percent among people with information available. The hospitalization rate in Salmonella outbreaks is usually around 20 percent.
Most of the sick people in this outbreak are adults over 60.
Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 14, 2019, to June 8, 2019. Most illnesses have occurred since April.
Interviews with ill people and early product distribution information indicate the likely source of this outbreak is whole, fresh papayas from Mexico that were sold in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.
This investigation is ongoing and CDC will provide more information as it comes available.
Advice to consumers, retailers, and restaurants:
If you live in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, or Rhode Island, do not eat whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico. Throw the papayas away, even if some of them were eaten and no one has gotten sick.
Do not eat fruit salads or other foods that include papayas from Mexico.
If you aren’t sure the papaya you bought is from Mexico, you can ask the place of purchase. When in doubt, don’t eat the papaya. Throw it out.
Wash and sanitize places where papayas were stored: countertops and refrigerator drawers or shelves. Follow these five steps to clean your refrigerator.
•The FDA strongly advises importers, suppliers, and distributors, as well as restaurants, retailers and other food service providers from all states to hold whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico.
About Salmonella:
Most people infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps 12-72 hours after eating contaminated food.
The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment.

Papaya Seeds Health Benefits
Highlights Papaya seeds are edible and can be eaten in a limited quantity
Papaya seeds provide various health benefits
The seeds can be consumed by grinding them
The many health benefits of papaya fruit are unequivocally known to all. This nutritious fruit, which is available throughout the year, is a source of tremendous nourishment for our overall health and wellness. Like many other fruits, papaya's skin-covered flesh encloses a number of seeds. Again, like many other fruits, the kernels are discarded to eat the juicy flesh. Have you ever wondered why do we assume that these seeds are inedible and just toss them out? Of course, they taste bitter if we accidentally bite into them, but does that mean they are not supposed to be eaten? Maybe, they are. Some experts suggest that papaya seeds can be ingested, only if taken in limits.


Dr. Anju Sood, a Bengaluru-based nutritionist points out, "Not all seeds are poisonous but some seeds are very bitter due to which, they create some kind of gastro-intestinal disturbance." According to many other nutritionists, papaya seeds are actually edible and can be eaten to avail their various health-benefiting properties.

Kosmetikerinnen empfehlen, einmal die Woche ein Peeling in die Gesichtspflege einzubauen. Doch das mag vor allem die empfindliche Haut nicht so gerne. Die mechanischen Schleifpartikel tragen zwar die abgestorbenen Hautschüppchen wie gewünscht ab, können die oberste Hautschicht aber auch sehr reizen. Für sensible Haut ist daher eine Hautpflege mit Peeling-Partikeln eher ungeeignet. Doch gänzlich auf ein Gesichtspeeling zu verzichten, wäre auch nicht der richtige Weg. Zum Glück gibt es das sanfte Enzympeeling – es eignet sich ideal für die reife Haut, für trockene Haut oder fettige Haut.

A papaya tree
BENGALURU: With dengue cases on the rise in Karnataka, social media has been flooded by claims of homegrown cures: the most popular is an extract of papaya (Carica papaya) leaves, which some people say can treat the disease in 48 hours.Doctors in the city have cautioned the public against believing in miracle fixes for dengue, but remain neutral on the efficacy of papaya leaf extract because it could alleviate dengue symptoms.A 2015 study by a team of Bengaluru doctors found partial truth in the claim that Carica papaya leaf extract (CPLE) pills, made from papaya leaf juice, reverse low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) â a condition in dengue haemorrhagic fever.The doctors carried out randomised controlled trials on 30 patients with dengue with low platelet count at two Bengaluru centres. They followed standard dengue management guidelines, with the exception of administering steroids. Half the patients, the intervention group, received CPLE tablet three times daily for five days.âThe result showed that CPLE had significant increase in the platelet count over the therapy duration in dengue fever patients, reiterating that it accelerates the increase in the platelet count compared to the controlled group,â said the study, which was published in Indian Medical Gazette in March 2015.Dr Ambanna C Gowda, who led the study, said papaya leaf extract stimulates bone marrow, causing production of more platelets. âIt stimulates platelet production well in patients with good immunity,â said Dr Gowda, who currently works with Fortis hospital.But Dr Gowda says the claim that papaya juice cures dengue in 24-48 hours is untrue. âThere are different ways to prepare the juice so itâs better taken at a hospital on advice from a doctor,â he said. âBut we have proven that CPLE increases expression of a protein coding gene and the platelet-activating factor receptor gene responsible for platelet production.âSeveral doctors report that patients ask them about the homegrown remedy. âI leave it to the patients and their families. They take it at their risk. Ditto with kiwi fruit. No confirmatory test or clinical trial has proved that papaya leaves can effectively treat dengue,â a community medicine expert said.According to Dr S Srinivas of Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), every fruit, and not just papaya, has antioxidants and helps patients get better. âThe juice of papaya leaves is not a proven remedy,â he said.

Following the potential outbreak of Salmonella associated with contaminated papayas from Mexico, demand for Guatemalan papayas has picked up.
“Demand is high and we’re meeting that demand,” says Mirna Skinner of WYCO Produce Inc. in Tampa, Fl. “Retailers and wholesalers are requesting more papaya and we’re supplying them with fruit to different locations in the continental US and Canada.” She adds that the containers are loaded with Guatemalan product on a daily basis to secure freshness.
In the spring, an import alert was issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowing U.S. ports of entry to detain Mexican papayas without physical examination following concerns of widespread Salmonella contamination. The outbreak spread to multiple states in the U.S. (This alert was withdrawn last week.)
Yet, WYCO Produce Inc., which supplies its private label Kaya Paya papaya from Guatemala, already saw an increase in demand late last year. “We’ve felt the pick up in demand since December 2018 and the rest of the year looks very promising for Kaya Paya brand and Wyco,” says Skinner, who adds that Kaya Paya is grown only in Guatemala and is a tainung variety of papaya as opposed to Mexico’s more popular variety, the maradol papaya. “We saw an increase in orders from our retailers and wholesalers in the first quarter this year. And in the past two weeks, orders from our retailers have quadrupled.”
Increased acreage
The ability to meet increased demand follows a strategic growing and marketing plan to expand Kaya Paya yields and boost its market presence in both retail and wholesale. And growing exposure can further help consumers understand the difference between the Mexican and Guatemalan product.
“The tainung variety differs from the maradol variety. Tainung is longer in shape while the maradol is rounder and smaller,” says Skinner. “The Guatemalan product is also more coral colored when you cut it open and has a green-orange coloring on the outside as it ripens. It can be eaten with high or low skin color. It also has a mellower taste that’s sweet and very flavorful.”
Skinner says the market has reacted and positively to the increase in demand. “We’re hoping that the consumers out west have this different product to try and they’ll be pleased with it,” she says.

I strongly recommend people to eat papaya regularly. It is such a succulent fruit. This alkaline fruit comes in various sizes and colours from yellow to amber to orange. Papaya is rich in minerals containing vitamin A, calcium and a high concentration of collagen healing vitamin C.
Raw or ripe, the papaya and its leaves contain curative properties. Unripe papaya contains a high concentration of the unique protease enzyme Papain enzyme similar to the stomach enzyme pepsin. That aids in the digestion of protein.
To feel clean from within I am always recommending the papaya. You are going to be shocked that I would ask you to eat the tiny black seeds which are in the centre of the fruit.
These seeds are edible. They are spicy with a pepper-like taste. This tiny seed is an effective way to detoxify the liver whose job is to filter the blood that comes from the digestive tract before it goes to the rest of the body.
This sulphur-rich peppery taste, much like wild mustard, can guard us against, and flush out, parasites and internal worms. Wait! It does not stop here. They have an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect on your digestive system. They are effective at killing E-coli, Salmonella, Staph and other dangerous bacteria.
You really must eat the raw or ripe papaya and its seeds. Try it. You will see the difference when you eat papaya daily for a few weeks. I can vouch on the way they remove bloat and flatulence and also prevent indigestion. Your digestive system will feel as if has been gently rinsed and internally and you will feel squeaky clean.
Papain, the enzyme in papaya, is renowned for its anti-cancer and skin cleansing properties. Very little of this enzyme is found in the fully ripe fruit. Papain has anti-cancer properties, as the enzymes eat the protein-laden material surrounding certain cancerous tumours especially breast cancer.
This is because the enzyme content is higher, and the sugar content of the fruit is lower (low-sugar diets are generally recommended for prevention and retardation of cancer).
Ripe papayas reduce the risk of arteriosclerosis, strokes and heart attacks. Carpaine, an alkaloid compound in papayas has anti-tumour properties and organ-healing properties. Carpaine lowers the concentration of fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream and helps to regenerate a hardened, dysfunctional liver.
The skin of the papaya enhances the skin of my clients and me and often I want you to observe that people with radiant skin and glowing eyes eat papaya regularly. To cleanse, tighten your skin and to lighten freckles you need the enzymes found in papaya to be applied on the skin.
The half-ripe papaya both eaten and applied on the skin soften and dissolve dead skin layers, while simultaneously the alkaline minerals nourish and support the creation of healthy skin. The enzymes immediately set to work tightening our skin's collagen tissue. Enzymes are capable of protecting and repairing elastic collagen fibres which both protect us against wrinkles and alleviate existing skin damage.
However, if you're pregnant or planning to conceive, raw papaya should be completely avoided.It is known that papaya is one of the healthiest fruits as it has healing properties from the flesh to the seed to the leaves.
The juice from the papaya leaves are your best home remedies for fighting dengue or malaria infections. Scientific studies have shown that they have some medicinal properties which increase platelet count and are also anti-malarial. Crush some papayas leaves, and drink 2 tablespoons of this bitter juice twice a day for best results.

In a recent post to her more than 400,000 followers on Instagram and Facebook , Landry shared a powerful message about showing up for yourself, no matter what you show up looking like.
“You don’t owe the world a two-piece bikini. You don’t owe them perky boobs and a flat stomach, either. You don’t need to apologize for your bloat that day, or explain why you’ve gained those extra 15 lbs,” Landry began. “But, it’s also OK if you do. It’s OK to wear a two piece. It’s OK to have perky boobs and a flat stomach. It’s OK to share why you’re bloated. It’s OK to talk about those 15 lbs, perhaps even normalizing a flux in weight.”
The mother-of-three also addressed the common misconception within the body positive community that all influencers or public figures remain firmly planted in a stasis of body confidence and acceptance. As one of the fastest rising faces in the movement, the mother-of-three refuses to not acknowledge the ups and downs of her ever-evolving relationship with her body.

“Just come. ⁣Just show up. ⁣However you are today,” she continued. “If you wear full jeans in the summer because you’re not ready for shorts, thanks for being here. If you rock a two piece and own your cellulite and stretch marks, thanks for being here. ⁣If you’re bloated and PMSing or holding extra weight but came anyway, thanks for being here.⁣If you’ve got perky boobs and a flat stomach, naturally or not, thanks for being here. ⁣The point is not (and never will be!)

The feeling of being a mother is beautiful, but it also brings with it a wave of happiness and stress. In fact, everyone around you would be elated and excited about the great news, but amidst these blissful preparations, it turns out to be a matter of great responsibility for the parent-to-be to take care of nutrition and health of the expecting mother as it directly impacts the developing fetus.‘What to eat’ and ‘what not to eat’ happens to be the biggest question for these nine months. However, eating healthy and nutritious for a pregnant woman is very important, but there are several foods that are not good to be consumed during this time as they can harm the fetus and one such fruit is papaya.Since ages, this fruit has got a negative reputation that it causes miscarriage and is often avoided during this time. Read on to find out whether papaya is really bad for expecting mother or is it just another myth!Eating fruits during pregnancy is suggested by almost all experts and doctors, but not all fruits are good for health. There’s a lot of confusion around papaya, when it comes to pregnancy and the simple answer is eating ripe papaya is good and unripe papaya isn’t good for pregnancy.Unripe papaya has a component called papain and latex. The presence of latex in papaya can trigger uterine contractions, which can often lead to miscarriage or early labor.What’s more, the presence of papain in unripe papaya can induce early labor and is not good for the fetus. It weakens the membranes around the fetus.It contains papain which your body may mistake for the prostaglandins sometimes used to induce labor. It may also weaken vital membranes that support the fetus. Hence, many women avoid eating unripe papaya during this time as it can lead to several complications. But in case you are too fond of ripe papaya then you must consult ypur doctor before adding it to ypur diet.

Papaya producers say that winter time is a slower period for papayas. Not only is demand reduced with the cooler weather in North America, but production also eases in the Mexican growing regions. Supplies into the US have been made tighter by rain, which has also resulted in more challenges with shipping.
"We grow papaya year round mostly in Colima, Mexico," said Edgar Millan of Caraveo Papayas. "During the months of November, December and January, it rained a lot and we experienced lower production as well as a reduced shelf life. As a result, this has meant there has been a shortage of papayas over the last two months. Prices have increased but overall movement is slower."
He said this situation is normal however, and with the weather already warming up, the expectations are for greater volumes to start coming into the United States again soon. "Production is improving now with the warmer weather and by March we will start seeing more fruit entering the market. Summer is a better time for papayas when supplies are strong and demand increases as people eat more tropical fruits."

Demand growing over the long term
While winter in general may be a quieter time for papayas, demand for the fruit has steadily increased in the US, suppliers say. They want to promote the health benefits of papayas to consumers who are seeking out healthy and nutritious snacks that are a little different from the norm. Papayas are also versatile as people tend to use them for a variety of dishes, aside from eating them fresh.
"Demand has been growing over the years as consumers find out that papayas are a very healthy fruit," Millan noted. "Papayas contain a lot of nutrients, particularly for the digestive system. Additionally, papayas have many different culinary uses. They can be eaten fresh or cooked. Papayas can also be made into a smoothies or other drinks, as well as savory dishes or sweet desserts. Each consumer has a different preference and papayas can accommodate these differences."
Improving papayas presence in the US
Millan shared that Caraveo Papayas has recently made some improvements in their supply chain with a new facility in Texas that enables them to distribute all over the United States. According to him, the level of interest in papaya will increase as more people become familiar with the fruit.
"The new facility in Texas complements our farms and packing house already located in Mexico," Millan said. "There is definitely room to grow because there is still a lot of people that are not familiar with papaya. Awareness is growing, however, and we see papayas being promoted more as well as being used in high-end restaurants. Additionally, there have been many improvements made over the years regarding food safety in Mexico. Producers are making significant investments into more quality controls, testing and training in order to raise food safety to a world class standard."

The summers are upon us and how. It seems, as if it was just yesterday that we were struggling to get out of our quilts and now we are seeing all things summery around us. From drinks to fruits and vegetables, our markets are lined with fresh seasonal produce and we cannot wait to get our hands on them. One delectable summer fruit we absolutely love is pink and orange fleshed papaya. The tropical fruit is known to be packed with several antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, which is good for eye-sight. Papaya is also a good source of vitamin C and antibacterial properties, which help keep your immunity strong. Being a good source of fibre, papaya aids smooth digestion and also helps keep bad cholesterol at bay. Papaya leaves are also useful in managing symptoms of dengue. Therefore, this summer you must make place for papaya in your diet. But try not to chug a jar of water soon after. While we understand, one is perpetually thirsty in summer, but drinking water right after papaya may lead to some tummy problems.


According to the book, 'Healing Foods' by DK Publishing House papaya can do wonders for digestion. It contains the "enzymes papain and chymonpapain. Both have been shown to aid digestion, prevent constipation, and, in combination with the fruits' natural fibre. Cleanse colon. Papain is also helpful in healing and preventing stomach ulcers." But drinking water right after papaya could have detrimental effect on your digestion.


The fibre-rich fruit is helpful in facilitating bowel movements. If you consume a lot of water right after it, your stool may over-soften. This may lead to diarrhoea. Besides, fruits like papaya, watermelon and veggies like cucumber are already so high in water, so it does not make sense to drink so much water immediately after eating the fruit. It tends to disturb the pH balance of the inner lining of your stomach.

It is believed that if you drink a lot of water post eating them, you may dilute the digestive juices. Some people with a sensitive stomach also experience uneasiness when they drink water soon after eating papaya. It is advisable to keep a window of 20-30 minutes between eating the fruit and drinking your first glass of water.

It must be noted that there not enough scientific studies to support that papaya and water are incompatible; however, in scorching heat it is believed that one must take all caution. If you have been facing some troubles with your tummy after eating any fruit, you must consult a doctor or a certified expert immediately.

Beijing Papaya Mobile Technology Co. recently rescinded its IPO application from the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s recently established science and technology innovation board.
SEE ALSO: A Brief Introduction to the Science and Technology Innovation Board
On March 29, 2019, the Shanghai Stock Exchange accepted the application for the listing of Papaya Mobile on the new science and technology innovation board, but on July 4, the company moved to withdraw it.
Upon further investigation of Papaya Mobile’s business model, it seems that the company is not so much a tech company as it is an ad agency for Facebook. In terms of intellectual property, Papaya Mobile owns 1 U.S. patent and 0 domestic patents. In addition, the company had negligible investments in research and development (R&D). This lead to questions about whether Papaya Mobile’s business operations rely on any core technologies that would deem the company worthy of a listing on the industry specific Shanghai science and tech innovation exchange.
Shanghai Stock Exchange building (Source: caproasia)
Originally, Papaya Mobile’s prospectus had positioned the company as one that relies on independent R&D technology for big data processing and analysis, mainly using global big data resources to provide overseas marketing services. After rounds of audits, it seems that Papaya Mobile recognized the inadequacies of its core technological innovations, and sought to remove its listing application.
Papaya Mobile helps Chinese firms in advertising overseas with their digital marketing. Much of this digital marketing initiative takes place in the form of purchasing Facebook ads. In fact, 91.99 percent of Papaya Mobile’s ad purchases were on Facebook. Ultimately, the company’s business model misled the Shanghai exchange, alleging heavy reliance on core technologies and R&D in areas like big data processing, but was actually more of a middle man for Facebook’s Asian advertising.

In addition to being a smoothie essential, papaya also has all components to become a mainstay in your DIY routine. The fruit is rich in papain, an exfoliating enzyme that can dissolve proteins. So when applied topically, it can aid chemical exfoliation while unclogging pores and preventing dullness or acne. The Vitamin C content in papayas helps to fight free radical damage, lightens dark marks, and supports the production of collagen and elastin. It’s even beneficial for the hair, as the enzymes can break down the dead cell build-up on the scalp to leave it healthier. Here, we give you five easy ways to use it in your weekend skin and hair routine.
1) Mash some papaya into a tightening and lifting face mask
Papaya contains high amounts of Vitamins A and C, which reduce the formation of the free radicals responsible for premature ageing. Added to that, the flavonoids in papaya boost collagen production, which makes the skin soft, firm and supple while reducing fine lines. Mix some papaya pulp with an egg white, as the latter has natural astringent properties that can help shrink enlarged pores. Apply and leave it on for 20 minutes before rinsing it off.
2) Papaya + honey: The ultimate glow-boosters
Papaya’s papain enzyme can clear dead cell build-up from the surface of the skin, which is the main culprit behind clogged pores and acne. Mix papaya with turmeric and honey to create an exfoliating but nourishing mask that renders skin radiant. Honey is an anti-inflammatory that soothes irritated skin, but it can also help make acne look less angry and red. The ingredient’s osmotic effect draws out excess fluid from a zit and heals it faster, while the healthy fats moisturise skin. The curcumin in turmeric helps to heal wounds (like a sunburnt patch of skin, a picked pimple or a scratch) by decreasing oxidation and lowering the stress response. Apply the mask for 15 minutes before washing it off to reveal a lit-from-within glow.
3) Whip up a deep conditioning hair pack for dry, frizzy strands
The ingredients for this simple mask (it just needs papayas and bananas) can be easily mistaken for breakfast, so we won’t judge if you sneak a spoonful before applying it on your hair. Papaya hydrates and nourishes hair from root to tip, which makes it a great antidote to dry or damaged hair. And the potassium and vitamin content present in bananas helps to hydrate and fortify fine hair. Once you apply the mask, wrap a warm towel around your hair after you apply the mask to boost its effects.
4) Blend together a face scrub for greasy skin
Mix the chemical exfoliating properties of papaya with the manual sloughing off oatmeal provides for a hard-working beauty-twofer. Papaya works to break the glue between dead skin cells, while the latter ingredient sweeps them off the skin surface. Mash papaya with ground oatmeal and massage in concentric circles around the face. The end result? Clear skin that looks matte and bright.
5) Mix up a purifying mask for a dandruff-prone scalp
The papain enzymes work to prevent oil build-up on the scalp, which often causes problems like dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Mix the papaya with neem and coconut oil for a one-two punch. The lauric acid in the oil has antimicrobial and anti-fungal properties, while linoleic acid boosts moisture and soothes the scalp. Neem is a powerful anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial ingredient as well. Apply the mask for 20 minutes before you head for a shower for best results.

A New York City abortion clinic has been holding workshops which aim to teach members of the public how to perform a termination.
Faithwire: ‘Arrested for Speaking the Truth’: British Street Preacher Wins Cash Payout From Police After Shock Arrest
Using a papaya fruit to mimic the uterus, abortionist Zoey Thill guided her class through a step-by-step aspiration abortion procedure.
VICE (glowingly) documented the process in horrifying detail. Though this is only being done to a papaya fruit, it still gives an insight into the absolutely brutal, cold and heartless method used to snuff out little lives on a daily basis:
“Thill brought us to a long table across the room, where several Hawaiian papayas were lined up on surgical pads. After telling us about the tools that were laid out—plus the ones she didn’t have with her, the speculum and tenaculum—Thill demonstrated a first-trimester abortion on the papaya she’d displayed earlier. She talked to the “patient” throughout, checking in on how they were doing as she inserted a finger into the “cervix,” then pantomimed inserting the speculum; she pretended to apply the local anesthetic and then began inserting the metal tapered rods on the table one by one to dilate the opening.
When the papaya was fully “dilated,” she placed a plastic tube called a cannula inside and attached it to a manual vacuum aspirator, a plastic, syringe-like device, sucking out the inner contents of the papaya: what, for our purposes, was the pregnancy. From start to finish, the procedure had taken no more than three minutes.”
Despite the sordid method being displayed, as the students finished up, the instructor went on to declare that it is “even more satisfying when it’s a real abortion.”
Fun Fact: Papayas make for a pretty....fruitful...training simulation for learning to provide first-trimester abortion care! ...We’ll see ourselves out. https://t.co/cKz0BFtJup — NARAL (@NARAL) July 25, 2019
Through the running of these hands-on workshops, Thill noted her desire to
“combat fear, misinformation, and stigma” surrounding abortion. Ironically, it is unlikely that the unfettered exterminating of young lives will gain more supporters after the true, grizzly nature of the procedure has been rightfully exposed through exercises like this one.

While Thill made it clear that this was not, necessarily, a class for people who were thinking about performing an at-home abortion, she did express her desire to host an event to help train people who are providing “underground” abortion services.
Faithwire: Australian Missionaries Hit With $2.3 Bill After Refusing to Pay Taxes Because They Are ‘Under Law of Almighty God’
The Reproductive Health Access Project (RHAP) has been offering these classes for a number of years to shatter the mystery regarding what an abortion procedure actually entails.
“We see it as a strategy to start a really honest conversation about what abortion is and isn’t, and destigmatize it,” RHAP’s Executive Director, Lisa Maldonado, told VICE. “The papaya workshop helps us do that in a really concrete way, usually in a small group setting where we can answer whatever questions people have.”
As for Thill, she hopes that the demonstrations will encourage people to ditch the term “surgical abortion” in exchange for “procedural abortion,” when it comes to describing late-term abortions. Why? Because “it makes it sound way more dramatic than it needs to be,” she said.
In reality, what could be more dramatic than the brutal murder of a human child, followed by the suctioning out of it’s mangled remains?

Johannesburg vegan restaurant Kaylee’s Eatery has figured out how to make salmon that looks, tastes, and even smells like lox using only papaya fruit.
Many chefs use carrots to create vegan lox, however, the Kaylee’s Eatery team – Kaylee Gottschalk, Dan Fredman, and chef Josh Simon – deemed the water content of the vegetable to be too high for its plant-based “Lox” bagel served with cashew cream cheese.
Instead, they looked to fruit. According to the trio, when sliced thinly, soaked in a smoky marinade, and dehydrated for several hours, papaya can convincingly mimic the taste and texture of fish.
For those who want a meatier dish, the team are also looking to create meatballs for stews and mince for lasagne using extracted pea protein.
“Plant-based eating is delicious, cruelty-free, and most of all sustainable,” Gottschalk told Eat Out magazine when asked about why she was creating the vegan versions of popular foods; the eatery also creates scrambled eggs out of tofu and serves vegan bacon.
“Whether you’re a yoga-loving sort of girl, a run in the park with your dog kind of guy. There is something here that is good for your body, mind, and for the planet,” the restaurant’s Facebook page notes. “At Kaylee’s, we try only to use the freshest and most seasonal ingredients to create our flavourful and full of good meals.”
It continues, “Yes, even our signature ‘salmon’ that you’re about to devour is plant-based, full of nutrients and cruelty-free.”
Vegan Salmon Surges in Popularity
Around the world, as consumers become increasingly aware of the negative consequences of overfishing, more and more vegan versions of popular fish dishes, such as smoked salmon, are becoming available.
In London, GreenBay – the city’s first vegan supermarket – offers Veggie Marine Salmon, made from algae. According to the business, thanks to its soft texture and fishy taste, it’s just like eating the real thing.
Gourmet plant-based seafood brand Sophie’s Kitchen also makes vegan smoked salmon, available in UK supermarket chain Sainsbury’s. And market trader F-ish, founded by Japanese-born Moko, makes jarred smoked salmon with carrots. “It allows people to experience the nostalgia and pleasure of a similar taste and texture,” she said, “but in a more sustainable way without compromising their values.”

Hyderabad: Prices of papaya hiked, suggested for its health benefits, have been rising in Hyderabad thanks to the spurt in dengue and other viral fever cases. Papaya was sold for Rs 25- 30 a kg in August last year is now selling briskly at between Rs 70-80.
One of the major symptoms of dengue is the drop in platelet count among patients. Medical experts say that the papaya leaf extract helps in increasing platelet count. Taking advantage of this, fruit traders have been taking advantage of the situation and selling it at exorbitant rates.

Papaya is one of the important fruit crops of India and all other papaya-growing countries. Owing to its high yield and profitability, it has become very popular among farmers in India. In addition, it contains enzyme papain and chymopapain, both of which are widely used in the food and drug.
Total annual world production is estimated at 13 million tonnes of fruits. India leads the world in papaya production contributing to over 43% of the global production, with an annual production of over 6 million MT.
Although the area under papaya cultivation in India increased by 63% from 45.2 thousand ha. in 1991-92 to 73.7 in 2001-02, neither the area under papaya nor production recorded significant increase over the recent years, mostly due to a number of limiting factors, of which Papaya Ring Spot Virus [PRSV] is the most important. The fact that the virus that was first reported from Hawaii in 1940s reached almost every papaya-growing area and the production fell to less than 50% by 2006 bears testimony to the destructive potential of the pathogen.
Stunted unproductive Virus affected plants and symptoms on the fruits.
The affected plants become stunted and early infection leads to absolute loss due to lack of fruit production. Fruits, often malformed, exhibit bumps and characteristic ring spots. The disease also adversely affects the taste and flavour of the fruit. The virus spreads through aphids (insect vector) in an exponential rate and a few infected plants are enough to spread an entire area. Hence, once it appears in the field it becomes a nightmare to the farmers.
Management
It is a well-known fact that there are no Viricides that kill the viruses, available anywhere in the world. Until now there is no absolute curative control measure available against this disease.
Green and yellow mosaic patterns on infected leaf. Picture right shows Severely infected leaves with shoe string appearance.
Dr. Vasanth Kumar Thimakapura, an independent Agriculture Scientist from the city, popularly known as ‘Plant Doctor’ owing to his success in developing management strategies against several ‘hard-to-control’ diseases, has developed a plant based eco-friendly formulation, which provides sustained protection against the dreaded virus throughout the crop cycle of two years.
The product (POWER PLUS) is both preventive and curative in nature that provides the only solution to the papaya growers to reap profitable harvests in spite of PRSV infection at any stage of the crop.
Virus infected papaya plantation [Before treatment]
The efficacy of the product is demonstrated beyond doubt in his experimental plot where several papaya plants with PRSV infection are maintained alongside the treated healthy plants with abundant fruiting, in a situation where a single plant is sufficient to affect the entire population.
The Virus has the potential to create disastrous epidemics. At a time when there is neither a variety of papaya that is resistant to the virus nor a viricide and a foolproof protection measure, the product has come as a boon to the farming community. Further, this product is non-toxic and can cure varieties of viruses in crops like beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, orchids, etc.
Recovery of plants from virus infection [After treatment]
The technology after five years of verification at the experimental plot and farmers’ fields is now ready for wider adoption. The results have withstood the scrutiny of several academicians and scientists from the conventional Universities, Agriculture and Horticulture Universities and National institutes, have evinced keen interest in his work and visited his demonstration plot.
Those who would like to visit the demonstration plot can visit the Bhoodevi Farm, Paduvaralli, Hunsur Road, Mysuru.

The FDA warned people to avoid Cavi brand fresh, whole papayas after distributor Agroson’s LLC refused to initiate a recall.
The agency is pursuing additional regulatory action in the investigation of a Salmonella Uganda outbreak centered in Northeast states that regulators say is likely linked to the papayas.
When Agroson’s, of Bronx, New York, refused the FDA’s request to recall the produce, the agency contacted wholesale customers of Agroson’s to ensure the fruit was no longer available for sale, has been discarded and not further processed or frozen.
“FDA is doing this to protect consumers as it pursues additional protective and regulatory action,” the agency says in its update on the outbreak. It has sickened 71 people, including 27 hospitalizations.
Earlier this month, the FDA announced that Agroson’s is the exclusive distributor of the papayas that likely made people sick, according to epidemiological and traceback information. At that time, the FDA said there had been no positive product samples.
The illnesses were in Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas. But people in all states should throw away Cavi brand whole, fresh papayas. If you can’t determine the brand of papaya, discard it, the FDA says.
Health officials had recommended that people avoid any whole, fresh papayas, but the FDA says it’s safe now to start eating them again, except for the Cavi brand.
The FDA “strongly advises” importers, suppliers, distributors, restaurants, retailers and other food service providers from all states to not sell or distribute the Cavi papayas.
The hold that the FDA issued at the end of June on all imported Mexican papayas is no longer necessary, and distributors can resume getting them to market, with the exception of the Cavi brand, FDA says.

At the outset, this farmer’s resolve to save his 6.5-acre standing papaya orchard appears nothing short of a ‘Bhagiratha Prayathnam’ (a prodigious or Herculean effort) as explained locally as he has sunk more than 10 borewells to meet irrigation needs of the crop which is expected to reach the harvesting (fruit-cutting) stage in late May.
He did not stop there when his efforts started proving to be insufficient due to fast depletion of groundwater table in the recent months and he rented two borewells of neighbouring farmers to utilise available water. The irony is that his farm at Chandrakal village of Pedda Kothapally mandal is at the highest gradient in the area and water from Jurala Right Main Canal and Kalwakurthy lift irrigation scheme reaches areas only a few kilometers away on either side.
Bolgam Srinivas, a farmer with a never-say-die attitude, planted a Taiwan variety papaya in 6.5 acres in November last and as he nurtured it carefully with drip irrigation the entire orchard is bearing tender papayas now. However, he started facing water shortage in all his borewells, which were able to pump at least some quantity of water till a couple of months back, and some of them have gone dry now due to over 36% average deficit rainfall in the district. The average groundwater table of the district has improved over the last couple of years due to filling of minor irrigation tanks with Jurala and Kalwakurthy water.
Unable to get required water from all his functional borewells he formed a farm-pond to collect water at one point and re-pump it to the drip system to ensure required pressure. “Although free 24×7 power supply has allowed me to run borewells anytime, depleting water table has become a major worry to save the orchard. I have covered the bed of my farm-pond with thick polythene sheets to prevent wastage of storage water through seepage,” he said.
The farmer has invested heavily on sinking borewells over the last few agricultural seasons and raising papaya crop. “I may have invested nothing less than ₹8 lakh on borewells so far and another ₹2 lakh on the papaya crop. I have also rented two borewells for ₹90,000 till completion of standing crop,” Mr. Srinivas explained.
If everything goes well and the farmer gets expected quantity and quality production of papaya he would be in a position to clear all his expenditure (investment) and be left with some profit. “I hope the borewells will hold required water till cutting of my papaya crop,” the farmer said optimistically.
According to horticulture officials, the average yield of papaya, if nurtured well, is about 25 to 30 tonnes an acre and the present market price is about ₹8,000 per tonne.

Contaminated Papaya Shed Light on Significant Safety Gap
A recent outbreak of illness caused by salmonella contaminated papayas are adding to the conversation had by many in the food safety industry. In the efforts made to keep consumers informed about food-related health risks, there are wide gaps that need addressing. The term ‘blanket statement’ is used to describe how many recalls are currently handled and it is not used in a warm, fuzzy way. The term is meant to describe the inability to pinpoint an outbreak to one manufacturer, producer or farmer, and the practice of then issuing a blanket warning to consumers covering all sources of a particular product suspected to be problematic.
Because we do not have good tracking of produce coming in to this country, and how it is dispersed once it arrives, we have a difficult time tracking down the origin when there is an issue. Lawmakers have passed legislation addressing food safety- in fact they have allocated millions in funding to this issue. And yet, as the way we do business, the speed at which we do business and the growth rate of business changes rapidly, we simply cannot keep up. Just as consumers need to keep up technologically, like when we upgrade our iPhones and other devices, so do regulatory agencies. Otherwise, the inefficient practices of today, as we have witnessed with this latest papaya/salmonella outbreak, will keep consumers in the dark, and at risk of illness or even death.
Last month, late June 2019, consumers were warned to not eat any papaya they had in their possession. Restaurants and markets were urged to remove this fruit from their shelves and de-contaminate any surfaces where the papaya was stored. The only information given at this time was ‘papayas from Mexico.’ As Mexico is the leading exporter of papayas, and this urgent message which only defined Mexico as the source, did nothing to help consumers identify if the produce they possessed or consumed even, was at risk, it simply blanketed all papayas, likely weakening the message in the process. Later, in early July, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was finally able to pinpoint the culprit as the brand Cavi, yes, from Mexico, but an actual, identified source.
As the CDC and Food & Drug Administration (FDA) struggled to put together the pieces, worked with producers and distributers to map the origin of the contaminated papayas, more than 70 people in 8 states became ill from salmonella contamination. If we had a better tracking system in place, streamlined the routing of imports into a shareable technology that allowed for better communication across the industry, we could more easily pinpoint products that are harmful and more quickly alert the public. Access to accurate, useful information that helps restaurants prepare food safe for consumption, stores to stock only non-contaminated foods and us, consumers, stay healthy is a blanket benefit that feels warm and fuzzy to me.

HYDERABAD: An unexpected group has stood to gain from the rise of dengue cases in the city. This group being papaya sellers as demand for the fruit is said to have shot up by 50% due to the perception that eating papayas result in an increased platelet count.On an average, the city gets a supply of 25 tonnes of papaya around this time of the year but the increased demand has resulted supply touching the 40-ton mark. Wholesale rates at the Gudimalkapur market have shot up from the usual Rs 15 to Rs 40 which has resulted in an open market rate for papayas reaching the Rs 100 mark.Doctors and nutritionists, however, claim that there is guarantee that the fruit is a cure for dengue. “There is no scientific proof that papayas help fight the disease We don’t recommend herbal cures such as aloe vera, papaya leaf and goat’s milk, ” said city-based physician Dr Chandrasekhar.

Story 105
A couple of papaya farmers were allegedly attacked by a few traders after a brief altercation over the sale of their stock at the Kothapet fruit market on Tuesday.
Farmer N. Chandraiah from Gudur village, Nagarkurnool, along with his cousin, N. Venkataiah, brought about two tonnes of papaya, listed for sale in the regular process of auction by a commission agent.
However, even before the auction was over, a few traders wanted him to sell the produce through them at a price suggested by them since his stock was of very good quality.
An altercation followed between the farmers and the traders and Chandraiah and his cousin were beaten up by the latter along with their supporters.
The two suffered injuries before police arrived to prevent further escalation. The fruit stock was later auctioned at ₹5,500 per tonne.
Minister for Agriculture S. Nirajan Reddy spoke to Director of Marketing G. Lakshmi Bai over the phone on Tuesday and asked her to lodge a complaint against the accused traders and cancel their licence.
Ms. Lakshmi Bai stated that the attackers were retail traders who sell fruits on their push-carts. The Assistant Director of Marketing was told to inquire into the incident, she stated.
Locals said that it was on account of the high demand for papaya that the farmers tried to circumvent the dealers and that led to the feud that called for police intervention.
A case under Sections 341 and 324 of the Indian Penal Code has been booked against the accused.

Objective: Thrombocytopenia in dengue fever (DF) is a well-known complication in both adults and pediatric subjects. Management of DF primarily includes symptomatic and intensive supportive care. There are studies available on the efficacy and safety of Carica papaya leaf extract (CPLE) in adult patients with DF. However, there are no published studies available on the efficacy and safety of CPLE in the pediatric age group. Hence, this study was conducted.
Methodology: A prospective, open-label, randomized controlled study was conducted in subjects aged between 1 and 12 years having thrombocytopenia associated with DF (NS-1 antigen positive) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) grades I and II. All participants were randomized into the intervention group (n =147, CPLE syrup + standard therapy) and the control group (n=147, received only standard therapy). All subjects were followed up daily for 5 days with monitoring of blood counts.
Results: A total of 285 subjects were finally evaluated for efficacy, and nine dropped out (seven in the control group and two in the intervention group). However, all 294 subjects were evaluated for safety. CPLE (Caripill) syrup increased the platelet count significantly compared to the control group (P<0.05). In the intervention group, the platelet count increased from day 3 onward: platelet count on day 3 (mean platelet count =89,739.31, P=0.030), day 4 (mean platelet count =120,788.96, P=0.019), and day 5 (mean platelet count =168,922.75 P=0.023). Two children complained of nausea in the intervention group. Overall, Caripill syrup was well tolerated.
Conclusion: CPLE syrup significantly increases the platelet count in pediatric DF patients and is well tolerated.

Story 108
Originaria dell’America Centrale, la Carica papaya appartiene alla famiglia delle Caricacee ed è comunemente conosciuta con il nome di papaya, usato per indicare sia la pianta sia il frutto. Fra gli indigeni era nota come “frutto della vitalità”, per le sue caratteristiche energizzanti e toniche; il navigatore portoghese Vasco da Gama la definiva “albero d’oro dell’eterna giovinezza”, sorpreso dalle proprietà benefiche evidenti sulla pelle delle donne che la utilizzavano. Vitamine, sali minerali e antiossidanti rendono la papaya utilissima per mantenere giovane mente e corpo, favorendo la disintossicazione di tutto l’organismo.
Papaya, una miniera di antiossidanti, vitamine e flavonoidi
La papaya è ricchissima di vitamina C, è una miniera di antiossidanti (come il selenio), flavonoidi, tocoferolo (vitamina E) e provitamina A, che l’organismo trasforma in vitamina A. I carotenoidi di cui è straricco questo frutto, insieme ad altre sostanze antiage, proteggono le cellule dai radicali liberi responsabili di rughe, macchie e altri segni di invecchiamento cutaneo.
La papaya rivitalizza con una pioggia di minerali ed enzimi
Dalla papaya si ottiene un succo ricco di papaina, un enzima capace di “digerire” le proteine alimentari, migliorando e regolarizzando i processi digestivi. La papaina ha le medesime proprietà della pepsina, enzima fondamentale per la digestione delle proteine: l'enzima della papaya alleggerisce così l’attività epatica e riduce la produzione di metaboliti di difficile digestione. Se le proteine non sono digerite correttamente, possono favorire l'insorgere artrite, stipsi, diabete, ipertensione e altre condizioni di salute correlate. L’azione benefica sul cuore è invece data dalla sua capacità di riduzione del colesterolo cattivo, grazie a fibre ed enzimi. Consumare papaya aiuta a tenere pulite le arterie e, grazie al potassio, regolarizza naturalmente la pressione arteriosa.
La papaya contrasta i segni del tempo
La vitamina E, presente nella papaya, è considerata il migliore antiage naturale. Ma è anche il licopene del frutto che agisce in tal senso: questa sostanza, che appartiene ai carotenoidi (pigmenti giallo-viola molto diffusi nei vegetali), combatte i radicali liberi e contrasta l’invecchiamento, favorendo la rigenerazione cellulare.
Depura e prolunga il senso di pienezza dopo i pasti
Spesso la fame nervosa nasce da uno stato di intossicazione latente. La papaya, fonte di antiossidanti, aiuta a ristabilire l’equilibrio acido-base facendolo virare verso l’alcalinità, grazie alla papaina. Risultato? Ci sentiamo meno gonfi e meno affamati. E poi un etto di papaya ha solo 43 calorie e un’alta percentuale di acqua. L’alto contenuto d’acqua della polpa garantisce dunque al frutto una funzione diuretica e drenante, rendendolo ideale anche nelle diete. La sua azione depurativa è fondamentale per combattere il ristagno dei liquidi in eccesso, causa dell’accumulo di tossine e scorie, e anticamera di pelle a buccia d’arancia e cellulite.
Rafforza vene e capillari
Tra le principali proprietà dei flavonoidi della papaya c’è quella di rafforzare i capillari sanguigni e mantenere la loro permeabilità. Dunque la papaya aiuta a contrastare l’insufficienza venosa e la fragilità capillare. Il suo consumo può risultare particolarmente utile anche in caso di vene varicose ed emorroidi.
Con la papaya alt a virus e batteri
L’elevata quantità di vitamina C presente nella papaya la rende un valido rimedio contro diversi disturbi d’origine virale, come l’influenza, e ne fa un efficace trattamento preventivo contro i malanni da raffreddamento. Come evidenziato da alcuni ricercatori dell’Agriculture and Agribusiness Department dell’Università di Karachi, in Pakistan, questo frutto è in grado di prevenire le disfunzioni renali e liberare l’intestino dai germi. In Nigeria per esempio è stato possibile liberare il 76,7 per cento dei bambini da vermi e batteri nocivi intestinali grazie a questo frutto.
Papaya: guida all'acquisto
Nelle zone tropicali, la papaya cresce e viene raccolta tutto l’anno, quindi non ha una vera e propria stagionalità. Ma la produzione è influenzata dall’alternanza di periodi secchi, che sviluppa frutti più dolci e zuccherini e quindi più arancioni, e di periodi piovosi, in cui i frutti sono più verdi. Come scegliere una papaya davvero buona? Se il frutto viene staccato dalla pianta ancora acerba non procede con la maturazione. Per evitare di incorrere quindi in una papaya poco matura dal gusto poco dolce, asprigno e poco piacevole al palato, con la fastidiosa sensazione che “lega i denti” come una banana ancora verde, scegli frutti dalla buccia che vira verso un bel giallo scartando quelli ancora molto verdi. Inoltre, leggi bene l’etichetta e prediligi un frutto arrivato nei nostri mercati per via aerea e non marittima (garanzia di qualità). Conservala a temperatura ambiente e non in frigorifero perché, come tutti i frutti tropicali, sopporta male il freddo.
Ecco i primi criteri da seguire

Papaya is an all-year-round fruit that is used in a wide range of dishes and drinks around the world. This is one fruit that you come to love only when you have developed a taste for it. You will not find many people confessing their love for this fruit, but the ones who love papaya cannot leave their house in the morning without eating a bowlful of it. It has a sweet taste and happens to be a treasure trove of nutrients like antioxidants, minerals and multi-vitamins. You can eat it raw or toss it in your fruit salad as it is an energy booster. We all are familiar with the health-benefiting properties of papaya like it is good for digestion and also keeps liver healthy, but did you know that eating papaya may also help you lose weight? Yes, you heard us right!
(Also Read: Calories In Papaya)
You can eat papaya raw or toss it in your fruit juice as it is an energy booster.
Papaya is a low-calorie fruit and can be included in your weight loss diet. A 100-gram serving of papaya has only 43 calories, as per the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). But that's not it. Papaya is also high in proteins, which help boost our digestion, prevent constipation and promote smooth bowel movement. According to the book, 'Healing Foods' by DK Publishing House, "Papaya contains the enzymes papain and chymonpapain (digestive enzymes), both have been shown to aid digestion, prevent constipation, and, in combination with the fruit's natural fibre, cleanse colon." A healthy gut and digestive system have also been linked with healthy weight loss.
Besides this, papaya is full of water and fibre content. Fibre keeps you full for longer and curbs untimely cravings. Moreover, fibre tends to thicken water and form a gel-like substance that sits in the gut. This substance further delays the emptying of the stomach and increases the time it takes to digest and absorb nutrients - all this results in a feeling of fullness.
So, what are you waiting for? Add papaya to your weight loss diet and lose weight naturally.

SILVER SPRING, Md., Aug. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Every day Americans enjoy an abundant food supply that is among the safest in the world. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration works tirelessly to ensure that foods available to consumers, whether they are produced domestically or abroad, meet the FDA's food safety requirements and that we are using all available tools to ensure compliance.
As demand and tastes continue to drive change in the market, consumers' desire for a variety of products available year-round have increased the number of imported foods offered for sale in the U.S. To keep up with this trend, we have doubled down on our efforts to ensure the safety of imported food. This includes issuing a new Strategy for the Safety of Imported Food and requesting new funding from Congress to support our efforts.
While we continue to focus on shifting our work upholding food safety from response to prevention, we know that there are times where we will still need to respond to problems when they arise, including outbreaks of foodborne illness. This is especially important when we see recurrent patterns of illness associated with particular commodities. For example, fresh papayas. This commodity is most often eaten raw, without cooking or processing to eliminate microbial hazards; and therefore, the way they are grown, harvested, packed, held, processed and distributed is crucial to minimizing the risk of contamination with human pathogens.
Unfortunately, since 2011, American consumers have been exposed to eight outbreaks caused by Salmonella serotypes linked to imported, fresh papaya. And, just this June we started an investigation into an outbreak of Salmonella Uganda illnesses tied to the consumption of whole, fresh papaya imported from Mexico. While the 2019 outbreak is ongoing, the first seven outbreaks accounted for almost 500 reported cases of illness, more than 100 hospitalizations, and two deaths.
This trend has to stop. The pattern of recurrent outbreaks we have observed since 2011, including the 2019 illnesses, have involved Salmonella infections traced back to, or are suspected of being associated with, papaya grown in Mexico. The recurring nature of these outbreaks is a clear indication that more must be done within all sectors of the papaya industry to protect its customers and to meet its legal obligations. This includes growers, importers and even retailers that can and must do more.
This is why today we have issued a letter calling on all sectors of the papaya industry to take actions to prevent these outbreaks in the future. We are urging growers, packers, shippers and retailers in the papaya industry to review their operations and make all necessary changes to strengthen public health safeguards.
Our letter calls on the papaya industry to assess the factors that make their crops vulnerable to contamination. If a foodborne pathogen is identified in the crop or growing environment, a root cause analysis should be performed to determine the likely source of contamination. Procedures and practices that minimize that contamination must be implemented.
We are strongly encouraging the papaya industry to examine the use and monitoring of water used to grow, spray (pesticides, fungicides), move, rinse or wax crops to identify and minimize risks from potential hazards. All sectors of the industry should adopt tools and practices needed to enhance traceability since papayas are a perishable commodity, to more rapidly facilitate the tracking of involved product to expedite its removal from commerce, prevent additional consumer exposures, and properly focus any recall actions.
And finally, they should fund and actively engage in food safety research to identify the potential sources and routes of contamination by microbial pathogens and develop data-driven and risk-based preventive controls.
In response to this most recent Salmonella Uganda outbreak, the FDA deployed an inspection team to the packing house and farm that was linked to the contaminated papayas via traceback and epidemiological evidence. The findings of those visits will be made public when their investigation is complete. We have also increased sampling and screening of papayas at the border. In addition, the FDA is actively collaborating with our counterparts in the Mexican government regarding this current outbreak through the agency's Latin America Office to determine ways to further our collaborative prevention efforts.
The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits food producers from introducing, or delivering for introduction, into interstate commerce adulterated foods (meaning foods that are potentially harmful to consumers). Additionally, there are new requirements under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The Produce Safety Rule under FSMA sets science- and risk-based minimum standards for domestic and foreign farms for the safe growing, harvesting, packing and holding of covered produce, which includes papayas. Another FSMA rule, the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) makes importers responsible for verifying that the foods they bring into the U.S., including papayas, have been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. safety standards.
We take our responsibility to protect public health very seriously and will continue to use all of our regulatory authorities and enforcement tools available to do so. So, today we issued a warning letter to a papaya importer, Agroson's LLC, following an FDA investigation at the facility in conjunction with the current outbreak. This investigation uncovered significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Rest assured that the FDA will continue to strengthen safeguards and prevent contaminated papayas from being imported into the U.S. Our efforts also include education, outreach, training and research activities designed to support farmers' efforts to keep their crops safe for consumers.
Although today's actions focus on the papaya industry, recurring outbreaks taking place with any commodity are unacceptable from a public health perspective. We know that more must be done by industry as repeated illness outbreaks are a threat to public health. In such situations, it is incumbent upon all sectors of the industry to work together to investigate the cause, review food safety procedures and practices, and take action to prevent further outbreaks.
We must take collective steps to eliminate the threat that recurring outbreaks pose to consumers and look forward to working with the papaya industry as well as all food producers to ensure that America's food supply remains among the safest in the world.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

Cavi brand of whole, fresh papayas distributed by Agrosonâs "are likely the source" of a salmonella outbreak in eight states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Phot courtesy Agroson's/Facebook
July 6 (UPI) -- A Cavi brand of whole, fresh papayas "are likely the source" of a salmonella outbreak in eight states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
On Friday, the federal agency warned people not to eat, serve or sell any Cavi brand whole, fresh papayas distributed by Agrosons, of Bronx, N.Y.
From Jan. 14 to June 16, 71 people have been sickened with salmonella infections and most have occurred since April, the CDC said Friday.
So far 27 have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported, the CDC said. The states where the oubreak have been reported are Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas.
Of 40 ill people with available information, 28 reported being of Hispanic ethnicity. In addition, most people in the outbreak are old than 60.
In June, the CDC recommended consumers avoid all papayas imported from Mexico.
But Friday, the CDC wrote that "epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicates Cavi brand whole, fresh papayas are a likely source of this outbreak."
RELATED FDA issues warning letters to companies connected to kratom
Importers, suppliers and distributors should not sell Cavi papayas distributed by AgroSons.
, The CDC urges customers to throw the papayas away, even if some of them were eaten and no one has gotten sick.
And if people are not sure whether they purchased the brand, the CDC said: "When in doubt, don't eat the papaya. Throw it out."
Agrosons didn't mention the outbreak on its website but said "papayas offer not only the luscious taste and sunlit color of the tropics, but are rich sources of antioxidant nutrients such as carotenes, vitamin C and flavonoids; the B vitamins, folate and pantothenic acid; and the minerals, potassium, copper, and magnesium; and fiber. Together, these nutrients promote the health of the cardiovascular system and also provide protection against colon cancer. In addition, papaya contains the digestive enzyme, papain, which is used like bromelain, a similar enzyme found in pineapple, to treat sports injuries, other causes of trauma, and allergies".
Salmonella poisoning symptoms include fever, diarrhea and stomach cramps but they usually appear about 12 to 72 after eating contaminated food. The illness can last between four to seven days, the CDC said.
The CDC has information about salmonella on its website.

Papaya and papaya leaf are nature’s those secret treasures which have incredible medical properties and health benefits to beat so many diseases where even medical treatment and doctor failed to cure and lost hope. Well, many are not aware of these natures' wonderful gift to a human while they spent lots of money on medical treatment. It just works like wonders in many health problems where sometimes you and even your doctor lost hope. Although it’s hard to believe but true, “nature is the treasure to cure all our problems, we just need a proper eye to find it.”
According to the book Healing Foods by DK Publishing House, papaya is “known to have antibacterial properties and promotes good digestion and almost every part of the plant can be used." While the fruit is rich in contents of vitamin E, C and beta-carotine making it loaded with antioxidant properties, the seeds are rich in fatty acids and papaya oil, have a sharp peppery flavor, and can be used in place of your spices. We will tell you the benefits of papaya leaf juice.
Let’s know about the diseases and where we need to include Papaya Leaf in our diet to beat it.
1. Treats Dengue Fever
Dengue is one of those major diseases which threats human life. Around 10,000 people in India are caught by Dengue fever every year and more than 5000 people lost their life. There are no specific antiviral medicines for dengue which make it worst. Dengue is transmitted by the bite of Aedesaegypti mosquito infected with any one of the four dengue viruses. Aedesaegepti mosquito bites during daylight hours. A person develops symptoms 3-14 days after the infective bite. Dengue fever severely brings down the blood platelet count and it will decrease day by day even if you are under the surveillance of medical treatment 24*7.
But papaya leaf works like magic in increasing blood platelet count which is the most necessary part in life-threatening diseases like Dengue. The extracts from papaya leaf are known to help increase the count.
Bangalore-based nutritionist, Dr. Sheela Krishnaswamy says, "Studies have proved that papaya leaf juice contributes significantly in the production of platelets and increase the platelet count."
2. Anti-Malarial Properties
It even works in Malaria as well. Papaya leaves have strong anti-malarial properties. A compound found in papaya leaf is acetogenin, which can help prevent dangerous disease like malaria and dengue.
3. Good for Liver
Just as papaya, papaya leaf juice also works as a potent cleansing agent for the liver, thereby healing many chronic liver diseases, jaundice, and liver cirrhosis. One glass of Papaya juice is enough to clean your liver and maintain your liver health.
4. Good for Digestion
“Papaya contains enzymes papain and chymonpapain. Both have been shown to aid digestion, prevent constipation and clean the colon. Papain is also helpful in healing and preventing stomach ulcers”, as per the book Healing Food .
Papaya leaves have protease and amylase which helps to break down proteins, carbs, and minerals aiding digestion. Its high anti-inflammatory properties also reduce the inflammation of the stomach and colon. The juice can also heal peptic ulcers by killing bacteria H.Pylori owing to its antimicrobial properties.
6.Reduces Menstrual Pain
Many of us are not aware of it and suffer the most. If you are also a victim of excruciating menstrual cramps and lower abdominal pain during your periods, then go for papaya leaf juice although it tastes horrible. Papaya leaf juice works wonders to ease the menstrual flow and reduce the pain. Drinking this juice also brings down PMS symptoms. Its potent healing properties balance hormones and regulate menstruation cycles. You can try this to treat your menstrual pain.

If it tastes sweet and delicious it can’t be healthy, right? Not so, in the case of papaya, a tropical fruit that originated in Central America and is packed full of nutrients, some of which help prevent cancer and heart disease.
“Papayas are one of the healthiest fruits around,” Dr. Ellen Kamhi, Ph.D., author of “The Natural Medicine Chest,” tells Newsmax. “They are rich in vitamin C, folate, potassium, fiber, and vitamins A, E, and K, along with antioxidant flavonoids.”
Here are some of the health benefits of papaya:

Consequences of virus infection
MYSURU: The fructification of a city-based scientist’s decade-long research is bound to enrich the fruit of many a farmer’s labour, quite literally – Vasanth Kumar Thimakapura’s plant-based eco-friendly formulation is being touted as the preventive remedy against the much-dreaded Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PRV), a bane for ryots dependent on the horticulture crop for their fortunes. Papaya is a biennial crop, and affliction by PRSV is a commonly reported problem in South Karnataka. Thimakapura averred that the formulation he has come up with is non-toxic, and can help control the spread of virus in other crops such as beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, orchids among others.President of the University of Mysore Old Students’ Association, and director of the technical wing of Green Lifescience Technologies, Thimakapura was determined to come up with a remedy for PRSV, a pestilent menace that is found across the world.For Thimakapura, the greatest reward for his work has been the results that farmers have reported after using his formulation for the past two years. “It has already been tested by farmers across India. This is besides many of the in-house trials that we have conducted,” said the scientist What sets the formulation – Thimakapura has named it ‘PowerPlus’ – apart is that it helps prevent the onslaught by the virus, and can help cure those plants blighted by it. Unaffected papaya plants in his plot growing beside those affected by PSRV, Thimakapura said, attested to the efficacy of his formulation. “The virus has the potential to trigger an epidemic. As of now, there is no variety of papaya that is resistant to the virus, nor is there a foolproof mechanism that can help protect them from its threat. So, I hope that my product will serve as a boon for farmers,” he said.Stunted growth, and lack of fruit-breaking ability are two of the most disastrous consequences of affliction by the Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PSRV) in papaya plants. Fruits borne by plants infected by the virus often exhibit clear signs of the disease: These include a discernible change in its taste, bumps and characteristic ring-shaped spots on the skin. PSRV spreads through an insect vector at an exponential rate, and all it takes for an entire plot to grow infested is a small clutch of PSRV-blighted plants. “Farmers dread it because it is impossible to contain its spread,” Vasanth Kumar Thimakapura said.

While it is no match against the horrors of everyday living, the people and places, creatures and chaos that go bump in the night—either paranormally experienced or conjured up by the human mind—can keep us awake to no end. But indulging in these paranormal constructs, and scaring ourselves silly is an age-old, somewhat inexplicable guilty pleasure. In time for the Halloween festivities this week, we've asked several people to either share personal experiences or contribute works of fiction that will help satisfy this national past time.

This was in Guadalupe, Makati in 2014, at my best friend’s old house. I stay there overnight at times, sleeping in their living room. This time, though, we slept at my friend's and his younger brother’s room in the attic. That night, it was just me and my friend. He slept on his own bed while I slept on floor. There were two light sources in the room, the smaller one near the door was open so it’s not really dark. In the middle of the night, I woke up as I felt I needed to pee. I was lying on my back that time; I usually sleep sideways or facedown. When I opened my eyes, I saw a dark figure sitting on top of me and about to choke me. I couldn’t figure out if it’s male or a female. It was faceless, just a dark figure of a human being. I was wide awake. I was so scared and I tried to scream to wake my best friend who was just a meter or two away from me. But, it didn’t sound like he could hear me.
I looked back at the entity on top of me and the load just kept getting heavier. It was choking me. With all my strength, I tried to switch sideways and closed my eyes and silently prayed. After a few minutes, I felt that it was gone. I opened my eyes again, slowly to check and it was indeed gone.
I checked my watch and it was a few minutes past 3 A.M. I didn’t bother waking up my best friend anymore. A couple of weeks passed and after having lunch in their home with their family, we came to a topic about strange experiences. I finally told them about my experience. I found out that my best friend and his brother experienced the same thing several times in their room. Their mom attested, even before they were young, their late dad always ensure to accompany them in their room specially at night. It was also the reason that they seldom sleep at night there and mostly stay at the living room or their mom’s room. That room doesn’t get sunlight in the daytime. In 2016, they renovated the house and brought the old one down. Now, they made sure that all rooms got sunlight and all other parts of the home. During the renovation, workers who stayed the night reported strange things and noises in the old house. It was a creepy experience I never want to have ever again.

It was an unforgettable night in Bantayan island. I was on a quick break from work with two others, Bryan and Kha. I remember it was just 9:45 P.M. We were really tired from the trip going there, and all the activities we did when we arrived.
Beside our room, there were three girls having a drinking session. We can hear them singing, and laughing hard. We then heard the sound of broken glass, followed by a wailing cry came from their room. It was so loud, we got worried and knocked on their door. Kha immediately called the hotel receptionist, and then Bryan and I went inside the room. We were shocked. There was blood everywhere. Apparently, one of the girls accidentally broke a beer bottle and slashed her leg.
An ambulance was on its way, but we couldn't get any immediate medical help from reception. So Kha and I went outside, to the nearby houses asking for help from those with tricycles. Nobody was awake at that time. We passed by this house and a man emerged from the shadows; he was laying from the hammock. We got freaked out, but we asked for his help anyway. He agreed. He was starting the tricycle when the ambulance came.
Bryan told us that he will accompany the three girls. I told them we will follow for assistance and got on the tricycle. This time, Kha got a bad feeling. It was weird. When we rode the tricycle she was really uncomfortable and was telling me to just not go.
I insisted though because Bryan might need help from taking care of the ladies. So off we went into the quiet night along the main road of Santa Fe. Almost everyone was asleep by now. The main highway was beautifully lit with the moon and the stars and only a few lamp posts were on. I was actually enjoying the view. I noticed a man under one of the few lamp posts beside a Papaya tree, wearing a white cap, a jean jacket worn over his white shirt, and maong pants, calling out to our tricycle making signs he wants to ride. I looked at manong driver to see if he will stop, but he did not. May he didn't see him, I thought. So yeah, we continued. But then, after driving for a few meters, our tricycle suddenly stopped. Engine and all. The driver was puzzled, and Kha by this time had her eyes closed and just saying, "sabi sayo wag na tayo pumunta e."
"I see the end of my bed suspended in the air at about 30 degrees and rising—and no one holding it up."
I was actually not worried. The driver was trying his best to start the engine, but it wouldn't turn on. Then, all of a sudden, my cellphone beeped with a text message from Bryan: "Okay na. Nasa center na kami ginagamot na." I replied, "Okay. Balik na kami ni Ate Kha."
When I informed the driver to just turn around, he turned the bike, and the engine suddenly roared to life. We started to go back to the hotel, iI was still looking outside admiring the scenery. Chills came down my spine when I saw this cemetery beside the road. Just when we passed by, the tricycle again stopped, and it felt like someone rode in the back seat. The driver was trying to start the engine again, but Kha is now crying. I was calmly tapping her shoulder and she told me, "Marvs, samahan mo ako magdasal." I did not quite understand, but I felt someone tapping my right shoulder, but I cant see anyone. That was the time I prayed with her.
When we started to pray the Our Father, the engine once again started. The driver told Kha calmly, "mam wag na kayo matakot. We started to drive again. Kha was still just praying with her eyes closed. We passed by this wooden house, now near the hotel. And then again, the tricycle engine stopped.
This time, the driver himself panicked. He shouted "Ay!" and quickly tried as fast as he could to start the engine. While he was doing this, we all felt someone got off from the tricycle back seat. Even the driver was shocked. He started to really pour all his effort to starting the tricycle. Once he did, he drove far away as fast as he could.
It was then 12:01 AM. I remember because i even joked about it . "Manong pasensya na. Nasiraan ka pa ng tricycle sa hatinggabi. Sana di masyadong seryoso," I said as we got off, and paid him.
He stopped and caught his breath. "Sir, 15 years ko na dinadrive yan. Mekaniko ako at alaga ko yan. Pero di sa akin kasi 'tong tricycle. Binigay lang to sa akin nung namatay yung tito ko. Alam nyo po ba bat ako natakot dun sa may bahay kanina? Dun nakatira yung tito ko. Kakalibing lang namin sa kanya nung isang linggo. Dun sa nadaanan nating sementeryo," he shared.
I told the driver about the main at the side of the road, "Manong kanina may pumapara na lalaki sayo. Akala ko di mo lang napansin kasi medyo faint, nakatayo sya sa may ilaw. Nangilabot ako kasi across nung sementeryo dun ko sya nakita. Sa may puno ng papaya. Naka jean jacket, white shirt, maong, and white cap."
That exact getup, the driver said, was what his uncle wore when he got run over by a multicab in the island. I wasn't able to sleep. I prayed 4 decades of the rosary the whole time.

This is not an OT story, but an early bird one. A few years ago, I worked as a copywriter in an old office in Makati, near Greenbelt 1. I usually like going to our office on the third floor early, usually 4 or 5 in the morning so I can get a lot more of my work done. It's just a short wait til others come in, anyway, and is definitely better than staying late at night.
Our office occupies the entire third floor and has a totally open design. With the exception of the elevator, CRs, and the pantry, you can see from one end of the office to the other. It was rows and rows of long desks for the different departments.
Our section is in one corner of the office and my desk has its back to everyone else. One morning I'm set up to go and it's about 4 A.M. I wasn't feeling scared at all coz I opened all the lights and had never had any scary experience before. I hear footsteps behind me. One at first, then several, followed by the sounds of computers powering up and keyboards clacking. I even hear the coffee machine whir up in the pantry. No biggie. This is something I got used to from doing this for a long time. Just people trickling in.
I even start to feel comforted by the sounds of chairs rolling about. Now, I'm introverted so I didn't look back. When I heard someone shout my name, I just shouted "Uy!" back with a half hearted wave of my hand. Again, didn't bother to look back. I was really busy checking stuff off my work list.
At around 4:30 A.M. or so, I became suddenly aware that all the noises stopped. All I was hearing were my own keyboard keys clacking.
Sure enough, when I look back, everything is quiet and empty. I would have screamed and run out, but my friend then walks in. I ask him to accompany me around the office to have a look. There was really nobody else there. No computers that were opened. No chairs out of place.
Needless to say, I always just went in on the dot after that.

Sino ang naniniwala sa pagpag? My uncle passed away in 2008. I was studying in Canada at the time and flew back as soon as I found out.
So fresh from a 14 hour flight, I went straight to my uncle's wake in Sanctuario in Forbes. I stayed for a bit and then went home because I was tired AF. I was greeted by my sister, who had the flu and was home alone. I had a quick dinner, bathed, and decided to retire for the night.
My sister and I stayed in a one-bedroom condo in Makati, but we decided to sleep in the sala. I was huddled near the window while my sister stayed on the couch. About 15 to 30 minutes in—wala pa masyadong smart phones nun so we couldn't really waste time playing candy crush till we fell asleep—I said, "Frannie, paki bukas naman yung ilaw."
She said no. I repeated my request but louder and with more ate authority.
"Paki bukas naman yung pü[email protected]& inang ilaw!"
She still declined.
I stood up and ran toward the main door to switch the lights on. I sat by the edge of the couch and told her why I was so pissed. I said that while I was trying to go to sleep, I felt someone or something was looking down at me from my side. Parang yung ginagawa ng mga tao pagtinitignan yung patay sa coffin.
My sister then said that, before I told her to turn on the lights, she saw a shadow or a dark figure standing beside me, looking down at me. She then asked if I did pagpag. I said no because I was so tired. She said I probably brought a random spirit home with me from Sanctuario kasi di rin niya kilala. Like, it wasn't my uncle, or a deceased relative.
Ever since then, ritual na talaga namin mag pagpag kahit sa 711 lang. My sister is a sensitive and probably has a partially opened third eye. We've had mumu experiences at Makati Med, too.

I was in med school and settling to sleep for the night. In the dorm room, I had just one roommate. We were both getting ready for exams, but as my test the next day was practicals, I knew I needed sleep more. She stayed awake to continue reviewing.
About an hour into sleep I had the sensation of someone lifting my bed from the foot. Not the mattress or blanket, the bed. I remember turning to my side, but still feeling sleepy. I feel the bed starting to move and I'm still halfway awake, thinking it was a dream. I was jolted awake by my roommate calling my name and screaming.
I look, and I see the end of my bed suspended in the air at about 30 degrees and rising—and no one holding it up. I scrambled off the bed and into her bed. As the bed started lifting off the floor, my roomie and I started praying the rosary. We heard a loud groan, then the bed dropped down. We never slept with the lights off for the next two years.

We had an old ancestral house in Horseshoe in Greenhills that was unusually dark and extremely foreboding. It wasn't helped by my grandmother's obsession with Catholic relics. She even had a zoomed in 8R-size photo of Mama Mary crying blood. It was the first thing that greeted you when you entered her room. Needless to say, I rarely went there.
We have several stories collectively as a family, but sharing a few that really stand out. I can't say these were what happened word for word, but it's how I best recall them.
Back when my siblings were just kids, my grandfather would usually spoil them by giving small treats like candies or snacks to eat, much to my mother's disdain. This was a time that I wasn't born yet. I never met my grandfather. It didn't happen frequently, but, of course my grandfather would sneak in every chance he would get.
One afternoon, it was after dinner when my mom had asked my siblings to get ready for bed. She had packed away and cleaned up, and found my siblings in the living room eating snacks. She was upset and started reprimanding them because they knew very well they weren't allowed. When asked where they got these, they just very calmly answered, "But mom, lolo came down to give it to us so we ate it." She went pale after that, because my grandfather had just passed away a month before.
Another incident concerned the bathroom on the landing, which I hated. It was a small space, lit only by a solitary warm light bulb and could only fit the toilet and the sink. It was claustrophobia-inducing, despite having a high ceiling. There was a small window that served as the exhaust, but it was no bigger than two by two feet. It was barely enough to let the light in, and was located above and behind the toilet. For some strange reason, I felt an uncontrollable urge to look at that window every time I would use the bathroom and would have my hair standing on end. It was extremely uncomfortable, like someone was watching you. I always rushed to do my business then got out. Some spirit questors later on had visited the house and reported their findings. It turns out, there was a little boy that they found peeking in that very bathroom window, and the boy was lost and just looking for his guardian.

I had one personal encounter. It was summer of last year, at around 3 or 4 A.M. As the fan was trying its best to cool the room, I opened the curtains and positioned my fan directly in front of my window. That way, the fan can siphon in the cool air from outside.
As I was trying to fall asleep, I stared lazily into the window hoping that sleep will visit me soon. But as I looked out I noticed something big, trudging past my window—a giant or a kapre. I thought I was just imagining it. But when the entity looked at me directly through the window, I was paralyzed and couldn’t breathe. It did nothing, but just look at me. I couldn’t move my body and was panicking as I tried to breathe. I prayed the Hail Mary and other prayers that I could think of all throughout the ordeal.
Then at one point, I managed to blink and then the vision was gone. I was able to breathe again, and move my body but I dare not move nor approach the window at that time. I must’ve fallen asleep after because it was lunch time the next day when I woke up.
When I told the experience to my family, my mom told me that when the workers were renovating the house, some of them were afraid to cut down our mango tree. When asked as to why, they told her that a bantay was in the area and they were afraid of disturbing it.
I must’ve showed itself to me at that time because the baranggay recently removed some branches of the tree because it was hitting the power line. Since then, I never approached the window in the wee hours of the morning.

We used to live in a 1980s condo in pre-development Kapitolyo. It had big windows with a beautiful city view. We were the lone tenants in the wing on that floor. The contractor who fixed my unit mentioned: "Ma'am, parati akong kinikilabutan dito, parang may nakatingin sa akin," whenever he waited in the hallway in front of my unit. I just brushed it off.
"But mom, lolo came down to give it to us so we ate it."
On our first month there, my son, who was in preschool, would peek out of the door's peephole to look at the hallway every 6 A.M., even before peeing, and every 8 P.M. before going to sleep. This was every day. So I asked him what he was looking at.
"Mom, there's a lola out there. And she's not our lola." Then he continues: "Mom, sometimes nasa stairs lang siya." And then it gets better.
"Mom, dead na raw siya."

I was an AE accompanying journalists on an offsite trip for a tech client. As part of an Amazing Race-style activity, we visited the foot of Mt. Mayon on ATVs. Our team in particular lagged on one of the challenges so nightfall came and we were still at the Mayon site. It was extremely dark and the only lights in the entire area came from our mobile phones and the headlights of the ATVs.
When we finally finished our team challenge, everyone rode their ATVs back to the entrance of the site where a van was waiting for us to take us back to our hotel. Most of our journalist-guests had their own ATVs, while I rode at the back of our tour guide’s ATV. We stayed at the back of the group to light everyone else’s path with our ATV’s headlights. Since ours was the last ATV, there was nothing behind me except pitch darkness and eerie silence.
The ride back to the parking area took around 10 minutes. A few minutes into the ride, the tour guide starts to make conversation. “Ma’am, nakakita na ba kayo ng patay?” he asks innocently. The hairs at the back of my neck stand up and I feel strange chill around me. “Hindi pa po... bakit?” I reply with a lot of dread. We’re still surrounded by darkness. My forward view is of faint lights from the other ATVs and something tells me not to even think of looking back.
The tour guide then starts to tell me that he’s seen a number of dead people in his lifetime. “Yung itsura nila nung namatay sila, minsan ganun pa din itsura nila. Hindi lang nila alam na patay na sila.” He proceeds to tell me about this dead man in his hometown whom he saw walking about after our tour guide had attended his funeral. He said not a lot of people can see what he sees. I ask him if he gets scared. He said he does, sometimes, but he just tells himself that the dead can’t harm him.
He continues to chatter on, and the whole time I’m just wishing the ride would end. I feel insanely creeped out and I can’t explain why, but I think it’s my imagination getting the best of me. The tour guide’s stories weren’t helping. Neither was the darkness and dead silence.
When we finally get to the van, I tell our tour guide, “Grabe kuya yung mga kwento mo ha. Hindi na ako makakatulog mamaya.” Our tour guide looks at me strangely and asks, “Ma’am, may mga narinig ba kayo kanina?” he says. “Pasensiya na ho sa mga kwento ko. Ang dami po kasing mga bumubulong sa inyo. Sa likod ninyo, sa tabi ninyo, sa mga puno. Ayoko po kayong matakot kaya nagkwento na lang ako nang nagkwento para mapunta sa akin yung focus ninyo.”
I was silent the whole van ride back to the hotel. I’ve never seen Mayon the same way again.

One time when I was a kid, I was sitting on the street in front of one of my friend's house. It was the afternoon and the sun was out. We were in a circle and I was facing their house. For some reason we were talking about ghosts at that time. And by this time, some of them know that I've seen my share of ghosts.
So we were talking and sharing stories. My sister was beside me because she is part of our barkada. After a while I glanced up toward the front door of my friend's house. There I saw a man standing in front of the door. He was in an all black suit with a white square on the neck—like what priests wear. He was bald. And his face was smushed. Like his forehead and his chin were pushed towards each other.
At first I didn't mind him. Maybe I was just imagining it. You know, if I look again he'll be gone. So I did. I looked at him again. At this point I knew I can see ghosts, because he was still standing there. We were staring at each other. Then he slowly smiled at me. That made me cry. I tried to keep it in because I didn't want my friends to say that I was doing it just because we were talking about ghosts. Baka sabihin nila papansin ako. But they noticed that I was crying and they kept asking why. Then my sister whispered to me "may nakikita ka no?"
We just stood up and went home and I didn't even explain it to my friends.
After some time, I remembered that my friend who owned that house shared that his parents could see a man at the back of their house who looked like a priest. I just put the two and two together and this is how I knew I see dead people.

สำหรับ PA PA YA!! (feat. F.HERO) เวอร์ชั่น official video นี้เป็นภาพการแสดงสดจากงานคอนเสิร์ตของ Babymetal ที่ Yokohama Arena ซึ่งกอล์ฟ ฟักกลิ้ง ฮีโร่ ได้ไปร่วมแสดงในงานนี้ด้วย โดยกอล์ฟได้เล่าถึงที่มาของบทเพลง จุดเริ่มต้นในการร่วมงานกันครั้งนี้ และความประทับใจ ภาคภูมิใจที่มีต่อการได้ร่วมงานกับ Babymetal เอาไว้ในเฟซบุ๊กฟักกลิ้ง ฮีโร่ ว่า
“ พี่แพน ผจก.ของผมโทรมาบอกผมในบ่ายวันหนึ่ง ว่ามีอีเมลฉบับหนึ่งส่งมาจากชาวญี่ปุ่น ผู้ส่งแนะนำตัวเองว่าเค้าชื่อ Key Kobayashi สนใจอยากนัดผมไปเจอเพื่อทำโพรเจกต์ร่วมกัน ในอีเมลระบุด้วยว่า เขาคือ Producer and Manager of Japanese Girls Band “BABYMETAL”
ไม่ต้องบอกก็รู้ว่าผมหูผึ่ง แต่ผึ่งหูได้ไม่นานก็ต้องรีบเก็บ เพราะอีกใจก็กลัวโดนมิจฉาชีพหลอกไปแทง ผมรีบให้เบลเซิร์ชชื่อ Key Kobayashi ในกูเกิ้ลดูถึงได้พบว่าเขาคือผู้ก่อตั้งวง BABYMETAL จริงๆ ภาพคุณ KEY ในกูเกิ้ลดูเป็นจิ๊กโก๋เฮฟวี่ ไว้หนวดผมยาว ท่าทางดุดัน
เราคุยกันผ่านพี่แพนได้ไม่นาน ผมก็ตกลงไปหาคุณ KEY ตามที่นัดหมาย วันนั้นนอกจากผมจะได้พบคุณ KEY ผมยังได้พบคุณ Takeshi ด้วย ทั้งสองคนเป็นผู้ใหญ่ใจดีผิดกับภาพจิ๊กโก๋เฮฟวี่ที่ผมวาดไว้
เราคุยกันผ่านล่ามที่เราทั้งสองฝ่ายต่างจ้างมา สรุปใจความคือคุณ KEY อยากให้ผมไปฟีทเจอริ่งเพลงใหม่ของ BABYMETAL ในตีมหน้าร้อน ก่อนจะหยิบ Demo มาให้ผมฟัง
เนื้อร้องทั้งเพลงนั้น สำรอกคำว่า Papaya หรือมะละกอในภาษาไทย ปนเมโลดี้ป๊อปเพราะๆที่ยังไม่มีเนื้อเพลงนาทีนั้นผมถึงได้ประจักษ์ ก่อนจะแย้มถามว่า คุณอยากทำเพลงเกี่ยวกับส้มตำใช่มั้ย ซึ่งคำตอบคือใช่ ผมบอกว่าจะแจ๋วมากถ้าเราจะเพิ่มพาร์ทดนตรีหมอลำเข้าไปในดนตรีเพลงนี้
นั่นจึงกลายเป็นบิ๊กโพรเจกต์ ไทย – ญี่ปุ่น ดินแดงอย่างแท้จริง ผมได้แนะนำให้คุณ KEY กับคุณ Takeshi รู้จักกับ Producer ไทยในตำนานอย่างแม๊ก Thitiwat Rongthong ผู้คร่ำหวอดและเอกอุด้านการเล่นดนตรีสดหลากประเภท แม๊กจึงเป็นตัวแทนโพรดิวเซอร์ไทยเรียบเรียงพิณอีสานและขลุ่ยให้อยู่ในเพลง Rock เพลงนี้ ก่อนจะลงมืออัดมันด้วยตัวเองที่ Studio28 ซึ่งวันอัดคุณ KEY และคุณ Takeshi ก็เดินทางจากญี่ปุ่นมาควบคุมด้วยตัวเอง
ตอนนั้นผมตั้งคำถามว่าทำไมวงระดับโลกอย่าง BABYMETAL ถึงเลือกที่จะทำเพลงเกี่ยวกับส้มตำแถมเลือกใช้แรปเปอร์ไทยโนเนมเข้ามาอยู่ในเพลง ในสเกลใหญ่ระดับโลก เค้าจะเลือกแรปเปอร์มีชื่อเสียงแค่ไหนก็ย่อมได้
คำตอบนั้นไม่ได้ชัดเจนจนไม่กี่วันก่อนปล่อยเพลง เกิดเหตุไม่คาดฝันคือมีการปล่อยเพลง Papaya ให้หลุดออกมาแบบผิดลิขสิทธิ์ ทั้งที่เพลงนี้มีแผนปล่อยในวันเล่นสดครั้งแรกที่ Yokohama Arena และทีมวางแผนจะเปิดตัวผมกันที่นั่น
BABYMETAL คือวงที่ไม่เคยมีแขกรับเชิญมาฟีทเจอริ่งในเพลงมาก่อน ทันทีที่แฟนเพลงเห็นชื่อผม ผู้คนต่างตั้งคำถามว่าผมคือใคร หลายเสียงเห็นว่าผมไม่คู่ควรและเริ่มมี Hate Speech ด่าผมในทวิตเตอร์มากขึ้นเรื่อยๆ นาทีนั้นผมเริ่มตระหนักว่าหรือผมไม่คู่ควรกับวงระดับโลกจริงๆ แม้แต่ในประเทศไทยเองก็มีแรปเปอร์อีกมากที่เหมาะสมกับระดับอินเตอร์มากกว่าผม ทู่ซี้กันไปก็เกรงจะเอาฝีมือตัวเองไปขายหน้าให้เค้าดูถูกแรปเปอร์ไทย
.. สามวันก่อนแสดงจริงที่ Yokohama Arena ผมมีความคิดว่าผมอยากถอนตัวจากการแสดงครั้งนี้ และอยากขอให้ทางวงตัดท่อนแรปผมทิ้งไป
ผมไลน์ไปหาแสตมป์เพื่อนรัก และเล่าความรู้สึกที่เกิดขึ้น แสตมป์บอกประโยคที่ทำให้ผมคิดได้ว่า
“เราคิดว่าคนที่สำคัญที่สุดที่นายต้องแคร์คือคนที่เลือกนาย
คือทางวงเลือกนาย ทางโพรดิวซ์เลือกนาย
Babymetal ดังที่สุดในโลกแล้ว เขาเลือกแรปเปอร์คนไหนก็ได้บนโลก เลือก Kendrick ยังได้เลย
.. แต่เขาเลือกนาย”
และนี่คือสาเหตุที่ผมกลับมายืนตระหง่านบน Yokohama Arena อีกครั้ง แสตมป์ทำให้ผมกลับมาคิดถึงอีเมลฉบับแรกที่คุณ KEY ส่งถึงผม การให้เกียรติกับผมตั้งแต่วันแรก ยอมรับไอเดียผมเรื่องเครื่องดนตรีอีสาน ยอมรับท่อนแรปภาษาไทยที่ไม่มีความเป็นสากลซักนิดให้อยู่ในผลงานชิ้นสำคัญ คนที่ผมควรจะให้ความเคารพคือคุณ KEY วงและทีมที่ให้เกียรติผม
ก่อนขึ้นแสดงวันแรก ผมตื่นกลัว คุณ KEY เดินมาตบไหล่บอกผมเป็นภาษาอังกฤษสั้นๆว่า
“You are my pride”
.. และนี่อาจเป็นคำเฉลยว่าเหตุใดถึงเป็นผม หรือส้มตำ
คำนั้นดังก้องในใจผมจนแสดงทั้งสองรอบเสร็จ หลังจบการแสดง ทวิตเตอร์ของผมก็เหมือนเนรมิตเสก Hate Speech หายไปเกือบหมด มีแต่ข้อความขอบคุณ ชื่นชม และการให้เกียรติของแฟนเพลง BABYMETAL ถูกส่งเข้ามา บ้างเป็นภาษาอังกฤษ ภาษาญี่ปุ่น ไปจนถึงภาษาอาหรับ
ทั้งหมดกล่าวถึงแรปภาษาไทย จากแรปเปอร์ตัวเล็กๆอย่างผม
พรุ่งนี้ผมจะกลับไทยแล้ว
ขอบคุณประสบการณ์ชิ้นสำคัญที่สุดครั้งหนึ่งในชีวิต
ผมจะจดจำไว้ไม่ลืม”
ได้รับรู้เรื่องราวและความในใจของกอล์ฟ ฟักกลิ้ง ฮีโร่ ซึ่งเป็นความภาคภูมิใจของศิลปินไทยที่ได้ไปอยู่ ณ จุดนั้นแล้วเราก็รู้สึก respect และภูมิใจไปกับเค้าด้วยเลยจริงๆ ซึ่งเป็นที่น่าสนใจที่ช่วงนี้ศิลปินไทยเริ่มมีสายสัมพันธ์ที่มีนัยยะสำคัญกับทางค่ายเพลงญี่ปุ่น ก่อนหน้านี้ก็มีข่าวดีที่ แสตมป์ อภิวัชร์ ได้เซ็นสัญญาเป็นศิลปินในค่าย Toy’s Factory ซึ่งก็เป็นค่ายต้นสังกัดของ Babymetal ด้วยเช่นกัน มาคราวนี้ก็แต่งเพลงเกี่ยวกับอาหารไทย แถมยังมีศิลปินไทยไปฟีเจอร์ริ่งอีกต่างหาก ทำให้เราก็อดลุ้นไม่ได้ว่าต่อไปจะมีอะไรมาเซอร์ไพรส์อีก และที่สำคัญเชื่อว่างานนี้คงทำให้แฟนๆ Babymetal ลุ้นๆกันอยู่ในใจแน่ว่า ฝันอาจจะเป็นจริงเสียที เพราะมีแนวโน้มมากขึ้นว่าวง Babymetal อาจจะมาเล่นคอนเสิร์ตในบ้านเรา ก็คงต้องรอลุ้นกันต่อไปว่าจะมีข่าวดีในอนาคตอันใกล้นี้หรือไม่

Cavi Brand Papaya Salmonella Outbreak: Cavi Papaya Direct Link to Salmonella Uganda Outbreak
After issuing a warning on all papaya imported from Mexico, due to a Salmonella Uganda contamination, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) are now confident that only one brand is to be avoided, Cavi brand papayas. These fresh, whole papayas are imported from Mexico and have only one distributor here in the states. Agroson’s LLC, of the Bronx, New York, has been in contact with health officials and are aware of the salmonella strain contamination. Although
authorities indicate that Agroson’s refuses to issue the recommended recall, news outlets and health organizations are doing their best to spread the word to consumers. Again, public health officials are confident that all other papaya brands are safe for consumption and not a part of this outbreak.
The Salmonella Uganda outbreak, which has developed over the previous six months, has impacted eight different states. The most highly impacted, i.e. having the most reported cases of illness, are New York at twenty-seven, New Jersey at eighteen and Connecticut at fourteen. In total, seventy-one individuals have reported illness as a result of Salmonella Uganda exposure with twenty-seven hospitalizations. Fortunately, no deaths have been reported. When this outbreak surfaced, as is protocol when an episode such as this occurs, the CDC quickly gathered as much information as they could in an attempt to mitigate further illness. Steps taken included interviewing ill consumers, tracing the product back to its original source and testing the suspected food source for the Salmonella Uganda bacteria. When they had enough data to comfortable declare Cavi brand papayas as the source, they worked to get the public aware and the product off of shelves.
Salmonella Uganda symptoms typically surface in 12-72 hours and last 4-7 days. Of all cases of this strain of salmonella, we typically see about a twenty percent hospitalization rate. In this outbreak, however, the hospitalization rate is closer to sixty percent. Public Health officials are asking distributors to stop distribution and to discard of the Cavi fresh, whole papayas. Restaurants and other food manufacturers are advised to stop serving this product or making items such as fruit salads or other mixes that include this brand. And consumers are warned of the same- discard of all Cavi brand papayas and disinfect all surfaces where they were stored. Salmonella infections are usually accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping. If you think you may have consumed this product already, or are concerned about contamination, you are urged to seek professional medical advice.

Selected McLaren fans gathered in Woking felt the love on Valentine's Day when the team uncovered its new MCL34 design.
The Renault-powered 2019-spec car design appeared in its traditional McLaren-papaya livery but with a creative portion of Vega Blue on its rear bodywork.
Regarding cosmetics, perhaps McLaren's most striking novelty for 2019 are the drivers' new blue and papaya race suits!
"The MCL34 is the result of an immense amount of hard work and dedication throughout our team," said McLaren CEO Zak Brown.
"We’re all committed, motivated and united in our ambition to return McLaren to competitiveness, and the MCL34 is only the start of this process.
"We have a fresh driver pairing, who together represent the new generation of Formula 1 talent, and are an integral part of the team and our collective effort to advance McLaren forward.
"The McLaren family is not only our people and our drivers, but also our superb partners and wonderful fans. We have a strong community of partners which continues to grow, and an incredible fanbase, who have all remained loyal and supportive throughout our highs and lows, and I’d like to thank them as we head into the 2019 season.
"As ever, we move fearlessly forward."
The MCL34 will make its on-track debut during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain (18-21 February & 26 February - 1 March).
McLaren stated in its release that Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris will share the driving duties across both tests, which likely dismisses any appearance of Fernando Alonso behind the wheel of the new contender. But then again, when it comes to Nando and McLaren, anything is possible...

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and state and local partners, investigated a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Uganda illnesses linked to Cavi Brand whole, fresh papayas.
According to the CDC, this outbreak appears to be over; however, the FDA’s investigational activities associated with this outbreak are ongoing.
The epidemiological and traceback information collected in the investigation confirmed that Agroson’s LLC of Bronx, New York, was the exclusive distributor of the imported papayas that made consumers from this outbreak sick.
On August 26, 2019 the FDA issued a statement calling on the papaya industry to improve practices and better protect consumers. Additionally, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to Agroson’s LLC, the distributor of Cavi brand papayas implicated in this outbreak.
The FDA asked Agroson’s LLC, the exclusive distributor of this brand, to conduct a voluntary recall of Cavi brand papayas. Agroson's LLC refused to initiate a recall. FDA contacted wholesale customers of Agroson’s LLC to ensure the fruit was no longer available for sale, had been discarded, or was not further processed or frozen. FDA did this to protect consumers as it pursued additional protective and regulatory actions.
Recommendation
Consumers and distributors no longer need to avoid or withhold Cavi brand whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico. The papayas that were linked to the illnesses in this outbreak are no longer on the market.

Saba has released a new surprise single entitled “Papaya.” The track follows his standout April album Care for Me and a string of more recent singles including last month’s upbeat, gospel-tinged “Stay Right Here” featuring fellow Chicagoan Mick Jenkins and singer Xavier Omär. The song comes amid Saba’s international tour, currently stationed in New Zealand and extending into Europe in February and March.
The track caps a breakout and bittersweet year for the Chicago rapper and producer, whose latest album, inspired by the murder of his cousin, cemented him as a premiere young talent engaged in Kendrickian lyricism that might, in an earlier era, be described as conscious. Saba brought Care for Me to NPR’s Tiny Desk in October and to this summer’s installment of his hometown Pitchfork Music Festival. He also guested on Noname’s album Room 25.

SUPERDRUG is recalling two gift sets by manufacturer Fruity as the shower gels could irritate users' skin.
The recall applies to the sets Fruity Trio Pineapple, which comes with a shower gel, body lotion and sponge, and the Fruity Tree Baubles, which comes with six types of shower gels.
1 The shower gels could irritate the skin of users, Superdrug has warned
Superdrug says it noticed the pineapple and papaya shower gel included in the Fruity Trio Pineapple set contained a higher than permitted amount of a preservative, which may cause skin irritation, during quality controls.
The same shower gel is also included in the Fruity Tree Baubles set, so the retailer is recalling all shower gels in those sets too "as a precautionary measure".
It adds that, so far, no issues have been reported from customers.
The Fruity Trio Pineapple and the Fruity Tree Baubles sets were on sale between September 2018 and January 2019 in all Superdrug stores as well as online. They cost £4 and £6, respectively.
If you've bought any of the products, don't get into a lather about it. Instead, stop using the shower gels immediately and return them to any Superdrug store for a full refund.
You can also call Superdrug's customer services on 03456 710709 or send an email to help@superdrug.com for more information.
A statement on Superdrug's website said: "The safety of customers is our top priority and we are very sorry for any inconvenience caused."
Your product recall rights PRODUCT recalls are an important means of protecting consumers from dangerous goods. As a general rule, if a recall involves a branded product, the manufacturer would usually have lead responsibility for the recall action. But it's often left up to supermarkets to notify customers when products could put them at risk. If you are concerned about the safety of a product you own, always check the manufacturer’s website to see if a safety notice has been issued. When it comes to appliances, rather than just food items, the onus is usually on you - the customer - to register the appliance with the manufacturer as if you don't there is no way of contacting you to tell you about a fault. If you become aware that an item you own has been recalled or has any safety noticed issued against it, make sure you follow the instructions given to you by the manufacturer. They should usually provide you with more information and a contact number on its safety notice. In some cases, the manufacturer might ask you to return the item for a full redund or arrange for the faulty product to be collected. You should not be charged for any recall work - such as a repair, replacement or collection of the recalled item.

Police in Rajasthan force-fed over a dozen bananas and two papayas to a thief who swallowed a gold chain to cover up his crime.
Gangashahar police station in-charge Subhash Bijarania told Hindustan Times that cops arrested two men who had snatched a gold chain from a woman shopping in Gangashahar area of Bikaner on Tuesday evening.
However, one of them identified as the snatcher on the basis of CCTV footage, swallowed the chain when police raided his hideout.
The accused identified as Rakesh “even released a taunting burp at the police,” according to the Times of India.
The cops took the accused to hospital where X-rays “showed pieces of gold chain lodged in his gut,” Bijarania said.
“Doctors advised us to put him on a course of potassium-rich food and feed him bananas and papaya instead of endoscopic surgery.”
The police then ordered more than a dozen bananas and two papayas and fed them to Rakesh.
The chain was recovered the next morning when Rakesh emptied his bowels.
Police also arrested Rakesh’s accomplice Vikram and both men are being questioned about their alleged involvement in other snatching cases.
In 2016, the Mumbai police were forced to take a similar recourse to recover a swallowed gold chain from a thief.
The 25-year-old man had been handed over to the police after being caught and thrashed by people for snatching a woman’s chain in Ghatkopar area.
Police had force-fed him four dozen bananas after an X-Ray showed the metallic object lodged inside his stomach.
He was then escorted to a bathroom and ordered to wash the chain with phenyl.
In a similar case from 2013, police in the Thane district of Maharashtra had force-fed a thief 96 bananas to recover an 11g gold chain.

Abortionist Practices on Papayas: ‘It’s Even More Satisfying When it’s a Real’ Baby Share Tweet
Papayas are a delicious tropical fruit enjoyed by millions of Americans, but for abortion doctors, they’re also a great way to teach medical students and the general public about abortion.
The use of papayas in abortion classes began around 2005, when two professors at the University of California, San Francisco, published a paper noting the similarities in size between a papaya and a uterus, Vice.com reported. Papayas, the professors argued, could benefit medical students and nurses in training.
But now abortion doctors are holding papaya workshops for the general public – not with the goal of teaching the population how to perform abortion but instead with the aim to “demystify and destigmatize” abortion, Vice said.
Vice writer Marie Solis attended such a workshop for the public in New York City. It was hosted by abortion doctor Zoey Thill.
“Thill said she wanted to educate people about what an abortion procedure entails – information she believes shouldn’t belong only to doctors – to help combat fear, misinformation, and stigma,” Solis wrote.
Different parts of the papaya represent specific parts of the uterus.
“The narrow part of the papaya, where the stem would be, is like the cervix, [Thill] said. The broader portion of the papaya is like the upper area of the uterus known as the fundus – and it's that part we would want to avoid puncturing with our tools,” Solis wrote.
“Thill demonstrated a first-trimester abortion on the papaya. … She talked to the ‘patient’ throughout, checking in on how they were doing as she inserted a finger into the ‘cervix,’ then pantomimed inserting the speculum; she pretended to apply the local anesthetic and then began inserting the metal tapered rods on the table one by one to dilate the opening.
“When the papaya was fully ‘dilated,’ she placed a plastic tube called a cannula inside and attached it to a manual vacuum aspirator, a plastic, syringe-like device, sucking out the inner contents of the papaya: what, for our purposes, was the pregnancy. From start to finish, the procedure had taken no more than three minutes,” Solis wrote.
When Thill was done, she commented, “It’s even more satisfying when it’s a real abortion.”
Thill said her ultimate goal is to “eventually host an event for people providing underground abortions.”
But not everyone is applauding papaya workshops. Marguerite Bowling, senior communications manager at the Heritage Foundation, tweeted that the mood would have been different if it had been a real-life abortion.
“Just wondering if there would be the same glee in this class if they did an actual abortion on a 10-week old unborn baby that had a beating heart, legs, head, etc.,” Bowling tweeted. “Extracting papaya seeds is far different than baby body parts.”

When it comes to fruits, papaya is an incredibly healthy option. It is a soft, fleshy fruit that can be used in a wide variety of culinary ways like in preparing puree, smoothies, salad, parathas, and halwa. The natural fiber of the fruit controls blood pressure, improves heart health, boosts immunity, prevent cancers and brings down cholesterol levels. The fruit is loaded with antioxidants that have a wide range of health benefits making it a great option to include in your diet. From salads and snacks to dessert, you do not want to miss out on these healthy papaya recipes. Have a look!

Name the popular tropical fruit of which India grows almost half the world’s supply. You might think mango or banana . While we grow, respectively, 18.8 and 29.1 per cent of global supply, they don’t come close to the 44 per cent of all papayas in the world which come from India. And which are mostly consumed here since, unlike other fruits, there’s little export demand.That’s massive for a fruit that came here relatively recently. Papayas came from Central America and by 1550 were being taken by the Spanish in the Manila galleons, ships that sailed across the Pacific to the Philippines. From there they spread very rapidly across Asia to India — seeds from here went to Naples in 1626. This rapid spread was made possible by papaya’s frantic growth rate. Along with banana, it is the rare tree fruit that produces within a year.Yet we didn’t like it much at first. An “insipid, not to say nasty, fruit,” sneers Hobson-Jobson, the compendium of Indian-English terms from 1886. Ranjit Singh and S K Saxena, in their standard book on Indian fruits, explain that “in the Punjab the fruit was considered to have a disagreeable odour and in South India it was considered to cause some women’s ailments”.But basic fruit economics won. Papaya is so ideally suited to India’s climate, and grows so fast and easily that most farms and gardens had them growing almost without realising it. In a poor and hungry country, the cheap and reliable availability of papaya was always going to be an advantage.Its blandly fruity flavour is never a show-stopper, yet has its virtues. There’s a calm friendliness to papaya, which makes it particularly good at breakfast, and for filling out fruit plates. Jane Grigson praises the attractive contrast between “yellowish-pink flesh… and the glistening grey-black seeds” while David Burton beautifully describes “its pink flesh miraculously hanging in the balance between solidity and liquescence”.Yet papaya’s blandness conceals a surprising sex life. The trees can be male, female or hermaphrodite, with both male and female parts. Both female and hermaphrodite trees produce fruit, with the former tending to be smaller, and seedless. The varieties we see in the market may be simply the produce of differently sexed trees.According to the outstanding website on fruits maintained by the University of Purdue, under extreme heat even male plants can produce “abnormally slender fruit.” Singh and Saxena note that “it has also been claimed that the sex of male plants can be changed by manuring and decapitating them,” which might be the most disturbing statement ever printed in a horticultural text.As summer’s high heat sets in we must hope that India’s often ignored papayas keep producing abundantly. Their low-key quality balances the intensity of the season, particularly when pulped and mixed with other fruit juices or with milk or dahi in a smoothie. That’s when their creamy texture, undemanding fruity sweetness and soothingly stomach filling ability give papayas a rare chance to find full fruity fandom.

Being a cannabis critic is far from a stressful gig, but we could all use a little vacation sometimes. Unfortunately, the most my budget can afford is a free trip to the park, but there are other ways to escape. While I’ve never been a huge Corona guy, the brewery’s “Find Your Beach” campaign, in which opening a Corona takes you to an imaginary tropical paradise, isn’t a total crock: Enjoying certain flavors or aromas is a great way to forget where you are and instead imagine where you want to be.
Given the plant’s head-changing qualities, a cannabis strain with sensory characteristics that remind you of a vacation can be very effective at “taking you away” from a shitty job, dumpy apartment or sweltering back yard. A recent trip to the pot shop even helped me escape a bad case of the Mondays after Papaya, an indica-leaning hybrid, presented itself.
Known for a calming tropical flavor reminiscent of papaya, mango, guava and other sweet and savory fruit, Papaya was originally bred by Nirvana Seeds, an online seed bank that specializes in Dutch and European genetics. The strain grows and looks like an indica, with short, bushy plants that produce round, resin-glazed buds, and its calming effects line up with that designation. The relaxation is more mental for the majority of the high, however, while many users report a jolt of focused energy that helps with work and creative production.

Most versions of Papaya carry Citral, Ice and Mango genetics, but I’ve heard of a Papaya bred from Jack Herer and Skunk, too. (It’s hard to imagine those tasting more like papaya than the popular version, though.) My favorite take on the strain is grown by Verde Natural Wellness; it carries savory notes of papaya and a honey-like sweetness that’s unmatched by any other one I’ve come across. I’ve also found Papaya at Life Flower Dispensary and Seed & Smith, as well as several dispensaries that carry Verde’s wholesale flower.
Find your bud.... Corona
Looks: Papaya comes packaged in large, round buds that usually resemble anything from a football to a fist. It has a bright-green color that looks almost nuclear, with creamy orange pistils and small trichomes dotting the calyxes.
Smell: Although it starts with a subtle sour scent that’s almost rancid, Papaya leaves a creamy, fruity smell lingering in your nostrils. The fruity notes are more tangy and luscious than acidic or sour, much like those of a passion fruit, mango or other tropical fruit...like papaya. Earthy, spicy notes round it out.
Flavor: That subtle sourness in Papaya’s smell is more cheesy and funky on the tastebuds, with an initial funk that slowly blends into a sweet, creamy flavor with hints of tropical fruit.
Effects: Papaya is known to create a productive spark of concentration, but that can peter out within a couple of hours — and that’s when the lull comes. I’d argue that Papaya is a hybrid, with the daytime/nighttime designation depending more on the user. The strain’s relaxing effects have been used to treat pain, stress, mental anguish, physical fatigue and nausea.
Commercial grower’s take: “It’s got some big-time Mango influences, and that’s probably what’s responsible for those intense tropical notes. I hear it’s pretty good against pests and does well in a dry climate — so I could see it being good for home grows in Colorado, if you’re okay with a nine-week flowering period. All that flavor takes time, I guess.”
Home grower’s take: “Takes too long in the grow for my liking. Unless you’re up for splitting some of that flowering space for another strain that can flower in six or seven weeks, you might go dry as you wait for Papaya’s 72-day [blooming] period. Could be good for an outdoor grow that only does one harvest per year — I hear it’s good against the elements and likes a dry climate — but who really does that?”

Let’s hope many more take a leaf out of these sellers’ books and adopt such innovative ways to reduce plastic usage.
Listen to our new podcast
January 1, 2019, marked a step in the sustainable direction for Tamil Nadu, as a state-wide plastic ban came into effect.
While this ban has certainly struck down heavily on manufacturers and dealers, there is a certain section of vendors who are turning heads with local alternatives.
It is common news that mandarai, banana and betel nut leaves and plates are gaining popularity for food packaging. But a few humble tender coconut sellers from the southern part of the state have found an innovative alternative to replace plastic straws.
Can you guess what it is?
Papaya stalk!
Yes, you read that right.
The news came to light after Thangam Pandian, a resident of Madurai, an organic farming enthusiast took to social media and shared the picture of a tender coconut seller serving fresh coconut water with a papaya stalk straw at the Maravankulam bus stop.
Speaking to The News Minute, the man shared, “He (the tender coconut seller) had collected them from his own farm, and these are available in plenty in papaya farms usually. This is the stalk that bears the fruit and the leaves. And farmers usually keep trimming the leaves, so there’s plenty of stem available. It is interesting that he has made use of them.”
Thangam adds how the stalk of the papaya that is semi sun-dried (mainly for the papaya milk) becomes quite sturdy and doesn’t bend easily. This property makes it better than conventional plastic straw, as even children can use it easily.
Apart from papaya, he explains how a few other kinds of grass can be used as alternatives to plastic.
“There are very few plants with a hollow stalk like that of papaya. If you take corn stalk, it has a spongy filling inside, which makes it unfit to be used as [a] straw. However, we do have the hardy sugarcane grass known as naanal in Tamil (botanical name: Saccharum arundinaceum), and plain old straw (vaikol in Tamil), can also be used to serve the purpose,” he says.

J Shanmuga Nathan, a resident of Tenkasi, who shared a picture of the tender coconut seller near the Essar Petrol pump between Tenkasi and Idaikal on Twitter, said, “Just right across the other side road, he found plenty of Bamboo stems which he thought he’ll make straws out of. From one bamboo, he can make about 6 to 10 such straws.”
He pointed out how using bamboo adds a unique and refreshing flavour to the tender coconut.
Let’s hope many more take a leaf out of these sellers’ books and find innovative ways to cope with the plastic ban!
If you are looking to eliminate plastic straws from your own life, here are some bamboo alternatives at The Better India Shop.

Kundapur, Oct 30: Mumbaru Dinakar Shetty from Kavarady village in the taluk goes to prove that a farmer who loves his profession can do wonders if he undertakes hard work. For people who pursue other professions, adoption of farming as a hobby can bring happiness in their lives. At a time when farmers are seen allowing their fertile land to go waste, interest taken by Dinakar Shetty and others who dream of raising crops in a small stretch of land that is not fertile and become successful at that, stand out.



Dinakar Shetty is a young agriculturist who has planted areca nut in a small area of 50 cents of hilly terrain. He planted 50 areca nut saplings, and followed systematic and organized way of farming. Within three and half years of planting, the first harvest of areca nut is ready. Shetty followed only organic method of agriculture. The first ever harvest in his plantation is ready to be harvested. He has been able to get 80 percent yield within three and half years and Shetty expects to get at least a thousand areca nuts in each tree.
Dinakar Shetty planned to raise areca nut trees in his half-acre land in . hilly area three and half years back. He levelled the land, dug four-feet deep pits, and planted different varieties of areca nut, hybrid coconut trees etc at specified gaps. He also planted hybrid coconut trees, sugarcane crop etc for impressing the rural populace of the need to maintain cleanliness and the need to maintain a system in farming. Shetty has found that maintaining the field clean reduces the chances of bacterial infection.
A visit to Shetty's farm surprises the people because of the level of cleanliness maintained there. He says that in such cases, bacterial infection chances are less. The fact that cleanliness improves performance of plants is proved by the farm of Shetty. The fact that cleanliness helps . trees to get better health is proved by his areca nut plants. The farmer will not be required to bring new soil from somewhere else for ten years as deep holes have been dug to plant trees. With the drip irrigation, he has been able to undertake additional cultivation of sugarcane,Papaya, banana, pineapple etc. Besides, water conservation is also achieved.
Shetty currently has created five small size nurseries. He plans to sell high quality areca nut breeds to the farmers. He has stock of a number of varieties of saplings and says he has not started nurseries for commercial purpose. Already thousands of saplings have been sold.
Shetty wants to expand nurseries, plant bush black pepper cultivation, providing encouragement to farmers by imparting knowledge etc towards augmenting their income.
He has many dreams for agriculture. Expansion of bush black pepper cultivation, expansion of nursery, educating farmers, encouraging farming etc are the immediate challenge she has been interested to tackle. His main aim is to confirm that farmers get good saplings.
For cultivating Sri Mangala and Inter C areca nut, before planting the saplings, minimum 2.5 feet, 2.5 feet wide and eight to nine feet deep pits have to be dug. A distance of ten feet should be maintained between pits. During their planting, 250 grams of neem oil cake, cattle shed manure and chicken manure should be provided to each of the pits. In the first year, fertilizer has to be provided three times. In the second year, leveling the space around the trees would be sufficient. If systematic method is followed and steps to conserve plants are taken, crops are ready in third year. during the year of yield, in the summer of the third year, as soon as shoots break out in the trees, lime should be painted around the trees. Otherwise, the wood might break during summer and pose dangers.
Dinakar Shetty says that the farmers mostly demand improved breeds of areca saplings. He can be contacted at 9449944344.

El análisis de la OCU otorga al rulo vegetal el distintivo de compra maestra
Uno de cada dos (49%) de los españoles ya ha probado las hamburguesas vegetales y el 57% de los que comen habitualmente comida vegana, lo hace a pesar de no ser vegano
Lidl se reafirma como el supermercado con mayor oferta de productos vegetarianos y veganos de marca propia en el mercado español
Con un precio de 8 euros el kilo, menos de la mitad que el resto de hamburguesas vegetales del mercado -el precio medio ronda los 18 euros el kilo-, el análisis reconoce el producto de Lidl, no solo por su calidad, sino por ser la hamburguesa vegetal con la mejor relación calidad-precio del mercado
Una vez más, la cadena de supermercados lidera la apuesta del sector por sumarse y alinear su oferta con las últimas tendencias en alimentación ecológica y vegana.
Datos del estudio ‘My Best Veggie: ¿conoces el mundo veggie?’1 reflejan que uno de cada dos (49%) españoles ya ha probado las hamburguesas vegetales. Este dato confirma que la alimentación vegana y vegetariana ya está más que presente en nuestra sociedad y que no solo los veganos y vegetarianos consumen este tipo de alimentos. Tanto es así, que el 57% de los españoles que comen habitualmente comida vegana, lo hace a pesar de no ser vegano. Es por ello, que Lidl desde hace tiempo ha apostado por la comida vegetariana y vegana con su marca propia My Best Veggie, pero todavía existen propiedades que los consumidores desconocen de estos productos.
Un reciente análisis realizado por la Organización de Consumidores y Usuarios (OCU) ha reconocido el rulo vegetal ecológico de tofu y algas de My Best Veggie de Lidl como ‘compra maestra’ por ser el mejor producto por su relación calidad-precio de entre las hamburguesas vegetales que hay en el mercado español actualmente. Con un precio de 5,99 euros (750 gramos) -menos de la mitad que la media del mercado de este tipo de productos: 18 euros/kilo-, Lidl reafirma así su posicionamiento como el supermercado con mayor oferta de productos vegetarianos y veganos en el mercado, con la intención de cubrir las necesidades de los consumidores a la manera Lidl, con calidad-precio inigualables. Pero además de haber sido reconocido con el distintivo de ‘compra maestra’, el rulo vegetal cuenta con dos ingredientes que aportan muchos beneficios saludables para el organismo.
La cadena de supermercados lidera así la apuesta del sector por sumarse y alinear su oferta con las últimas tendencias en alimentación ecológica y vegana y reinventa -en formato rulo- una de las tendencias de consumo más destacadas a nivel internacional: la ‘burger’ vegana.
Según Jaime Martín, CEO de la consultora Lantern y responsable del estudio ‘The Green Revolution’, "la tendencia del consumo de sustitutivos cárnicos tiene como producto estrella la hamburguesa vegetal. Gusta a vegetarianos y veganos, pero también atrae a consumidores preocupados por tener una opción saludable y sabrosa".
Curiosidades del tofu y las algas
El tofu es un alimento de origen 100% vegetal elaborado a partir de semillas de soja. La soja es la legumbre más consumida en el mundo, por encima de las lentejas, los garbanzos y las judías. Esto se debe sobre todo a que es una de las principales bases de la alimentación de los países asiáticos.
El tofu es muy utilizado en la cocina vegetariana y vegana como un sustituto de la carne, porque aporta numerosos beneficios y su ingesta es recomendable para todas las edades: niños, adultos y personas mayores. Algunos de sus beneficios son:
Alto aporte de proteínas de muy buena calidad y alta digestibilidad. De hecho, es más fácil de dirigir que las proteínas animales. Por ello, y por sus ocho aminoácidos esenciales, es una buena fuente de energía.
Más sostenible. La producción de la soja implica menos costes que la producción de carne, tanto económicos como ambientales.
Las isoflavonas (estrógenos vegetales) que contiene la soja resultan muy beneficiosas para la mujer, ya que equilibran el estado hormonal del organismo y ayudan a prevenir los síntomas de la menopausia: sofocos, calambres o cambios de humor.
Grasas saludables, como la lecitina, que ayudan a disminuir el riesgo de sufrir enfermedades cardiovasculares, controlan el colesterol, fortalecen los nervios y facilitan la absorción de las vitaminas A, E, D y K y es rica en fibra.
Rica en minerales y vitaminas. Alto porte de calcio, importante sobre todo para aquellas personas que restringen el consumo de lácteos en su dieta y bueno para la osteoporosis. También aporta hierro (previene la anemia), fósforo (ayuda al correcto funcionamiento de la memoria) y potasio (reduce la hipertensión y la retención de líquidos). Además, sus vitaminas del grupo B resultan esenciales para el sistema nervioso, sobre todo la vitamina B1.
Los fitoquímicos presentes en el tofu, así como las vitaminas y minerales, favorecen la creación de anticuerpos.
El rulo vegetal ecológico de My Best Veggie contiene además algas, que también son altamente beneficiosas por aportar minerales y vitaminas -como el calcio, magnesio, fósforo, hierro y vitamina C-, por facilitar las digestiones y producir mayor sensación de saciedad, y porque su bajo contenido en grasa favorece la salud cardiovascular. El estudio ‘My Best Veggie: ¿conoces el mundo veggie?’ destaca también que para el 67% de los veganos, flexitarianos y vegetarianos la salud es el factor clave en su cambio de alimentación.
El uso de las algas, además, se encuentra muy popularizado en la dieta vegana no solo por sus propiedades nutritivas, sino también como sustitutivo de pescados y mariscos en diversos platos y recetas, ya que aporta un característico y agradable sabor a mar.

¿Qué más debes saber sobre el rulo vegetal?
El rulo vegetal cuenta con el sello 100% vegano y sin lactosa. Se trata de un preparado vegetal cuyos ingredientes proceden de la agricultura ecológica en su totalidad. Además de contener tofu y algas wakame, otros de los ingredientes que encontramos en este producto son el gluten de trigo, copos de avena, brócoli, borraja, tomate, aceite de oliva, cebolla, salsa de soja, ajo, sal marina, orégano y pimienta blanca. Una vez más, la cadena de supermercados lidera la apuesta del sector por sumarse y alinear su oferta con las últimas tendencias en alimentación ecológica y vegana.
“Con la combinación de tofu y algas en el rulo vegetal ecológico apostamos por un producto rico en sabor y cuyos ingredientes principales aportan muchos beneficios a nuestro organismo”, afirma Arantxa Conde, responsable de Relaciones Públicas de Lidl España.
A la hora de preparar un plato con este producto, el rulo vegetal ecológico destaca por ser económico y versátil. Su formato de 750 gramos permite cortarlo con el grosor deseado para realizar una hamburguesa o bien, más fino, un filete y hacerlo vuelta y vuelta en la sartén, pudiendo guardar el resto del rulo de nuevo en la nevera o en el congelador para próximos días. ¿Un truco? Lonchear el filete antes de congelarlo y así descongelar la cantidad de filetes deseada sin tener que descongelar la totalidad del taco. Otras opciones que resultan muy prácticas para el consumidor es trocearlo, picarlo o rallarlo para acompañar platos de pasta, arroces o verduras.
Receta rica, saludable y fácil
Aunque el tofu es fácilmente combinable con otros ingredientes, te proponemos una receta muy sencilla para hacer en casa: el wrap de rulo vegetariano con salsa de papaya y curry.
Ingredientes: tomate, aguacate, cebolla, zumo de lima, cilantro, calabacín, berenjena, rulo vegetal ecológico de Lidl, untable de papaya y curry de Lidl, y tortitas de trigo.

For a month-and-a-half, variou­s Karach­i depart­ments have been busy refore­sting the previo­usly encroa­ched park
KARACHI: If tracts of land were people, then in Karachi, parks would be second-class citizens. The facilities or land earmarked for them seem to suffer a similar fate for the most part. Where parks should be treated as a valuable environmental and entertainment resource given the dearth of both in the city, all greedy land developers see is an opportunity for encroachment.
Located at a stone’s throw from Rangoonwala Hall and Bahadurabad Chowrangi, Kidney Hill Park suffered the same fate for decades. After its doors were closed to the public some 50 years ago, the land it was established upon was illegally occupied by both public and private entities.
That is until the start of this year when the Supreme Court ordered a massive anti-encroachment drive in the city. As part of efforts to clear out land occupied by encroachers, city authorities demolished illegal structures erected within Kidney Hill Park premises, which included, rather surprisingly, an entire colony for Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) staff.
UN Habitat to extend support for clean, green movement in Pakistan
With the park land now free, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation has been keen to re-establish Kidney Hill as a state-of-the-art urban forest on a par with Islamabad’s Daman-e-Koh. For the past month-and-a-half, the officers and staff of KMC, the Horticulture Department, Karachi Zoo and the city’s municipal services have been working to beautify the park.
A makeover in progress
According to officials, all unkempt trees and shrubs have been groomed, while the trails have been cleaned and flattened to make them easier to traverse. Stray dogs have also been removed from the park with the help of the Edhi Welfare Foundation, they said.
“We are currently in the first phase of the project and carrying out departmental work,” Municipal Commissioner Dr Saifur Rehman told The Express Tribune. “We are currently planting trees – we plan to plant as many as 10,000 in phase one – and clearing out the various park trails,” he said.
“KMC is growing more than 25 types of plants in the park,” said Karachi Zoo’s Senior Recreation Director Mansoor Qazi. “We have planted 7,000 so far.” He added that the plan envisions six types of forests within the park: “There will be a timber forest, a fruit forest, a creeper forest and a jungle-type environment. We will also have stretches with medicinal plants and bushes and shrubs.”
According to Qazi, most of the plants have been sourced by KMC from its nurseries. In addition to that, Indus Motors, MUFG Bank and Al-Habib Bank have donated 3,500 plants. The medicinal plants and fruit trees being grown include banana, mango, dates, lemon, sapodilla, malta, papaya, coconut, blackberry, guava, apricot, fig, banyan, tamarind, morinaga and wood-apple among others.
Thousands of tonnes of litter have also been removed from park land as part of phase one, Municipal Commissioner Rehman said. “As many as 500 trucks lifted the garbage, dumped by both residences and businesses in the vicinity, from the park. We also plan to carry out a special cleanliness drive with civil society volunteers shortly.”
He outlined that the plan is to create 12 corridors in the park. “These will be named after renowned Pakistani tourist spots, like Saiful Muluk, Karakoram, Rakaposhi and Dhoraji,” he said. While no trees would be chopped down to make way for the corridors, the authorities will trim down shrubs and bushes around them. “All this work will be completed in a month and the park will be opened to the public.”
Rehman added that four gates have been installed to restrict the movement of potential miscreants. “We have also deputed a city warden.”
According to the municipal commissioner, a consultant will be hired in phase two to create a comprehensive plan for the park. “We want an aviary and an open enclosure on the pattern of Safari Park. We also want a play area for children and an artificial lake along with a cafeteria or canteen,” he said.
Pushback from ‘influentials’
The plan to re-establish Kidney Hill Park did not stay immune to resistance from other quarters. According to KMC officials, several influential individuals tried to pressure the corporation into giving up the initiative.
“It was a difficult phase, but Municipal Commissioner Rehman not only stood up to the pressure but made it very clear that this project was being carried out in accordance with the Supreme Court orders,” said one KMC official. “Thanks to his stance, any resistance to the project has now subsided.”
Much needed oxygen
Kidney Hill’s urban forest is expected to make a significant addition to Karachi’s otherwise sparse tree population. By itself, however, it will not be enough to improve the city’s environmental conditions, according to experts.
DG Khan Safari to open in December
“KMC’s forestation efforts in Kidney Hill Park are a great step, but they should be followed up with a comprehensive plan to increase greenery in Karachi,” said Horticulture Society of Pakistan Council (HSPC) member Rafiul Haq. “Not only should the plants being grown there be looked after persistently, but a massive plantation campaign should also be carried out on other vacant lands in the city.”
According to Haq, Karachi needs at least 140 million trees to keep it from becoming an urban heat sink. “Due to numerous concrete structures, including high-rises, and road development, it has become more and more important to grow more trees. Concrete and the material used in roads releases heat for a long time, increasing temperature intensity in the city.”
Kidney Hill, then and now
The land for Kidney Hill Park was allocated by the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) in KDA Scheme 32 in 1966. Owing to its geographical outline and the many natural hills in its vicinity, it adopted the peculiar name of Kidney Hill Park, which was later changed to Ahmed Ali Kidney Hill Park after KDA Senior Director of Planning, Ahmed Ali.
However, there’s little KDA can be credited for besides allocating land and erecting a kidney-esque boundary wall around the public park, before handing it over to Karachi Municipal Corporation, which too failed to do much for the park in terms of development and maintenance and it was left for the howls of stray dogs and criminal elements to haunt for decades.

In life, everyone has to go through painful experiences: heartbreaks, goodbyes, failures. But in your quest for brighter skin, hindi na dapat magtiis sa kahit anong pain.
Stinging, red, and sore skin from harsh whitening chemicals not only causes discomfort; it may also cause permanent skin discoloration such as melasma and skin blotches.
Over-exfoliation through scrubbing and aggressive skin peels can also cause skin to darken even more or, worse, permanent scarring!
So how can you achieve brighter skin without the sting?
AVOID STAYING UNDER THE SUN FOR TOO LONG
You know by now that prolonged sun exposure is bad for you. To keep your skin fair and bright, it’s best to avoid going out under the sun when it’s at its strongest, usually between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
If you really have to go out during this time frame, make sure to apply sunscreen or lotion with high SPF content–like Silka Green Premium Whitening Lotion SPF30–and use an umbrella to shield your skin from the sun’s harmful rays.
ALWAYS USE SUNSCREEN
And we mean always—maaraw man o hindi—and reapply after every two hours.
Sunscreen can block the production of pigment and/or lift pigment out of the skin so it brightens your complexion.
DON'T FORGET TO EXFOLIATE GENTLY
Do you notice how areas where your skin gets a lot of friction—like kilikili, singit, and elbows—are usually the darkest? This is because the skin becomes darker as a protective mechanism from too much friction.
So if you use harsh scrubs or are very aggressive with your loofah your skin will likely turn red, and then darker. Avoid this by exfoliating gently, with just enough force to remove dead skin cells that give your skin a dull and dry appearance. Doing so also helps your skin to absorb nutrients so it looks better and brighter.
Use gentle products and huwag masyado manggigil sa paghilod!
USE THE RIGHT SKIN-BRIGHTENING PRODUCTS
There are a lot of products out there that give brighter skin, but choose ones without harsh chemicals and can offer results na hindi tiis-ganda at 'di ka sasaktan.
Kaya ma-achieve ang puting walang hapdi. Try Silka Green Papaya Soap. It’s a body soap that helps brighten skin faster and without the sting. It moisturizes the skin for a beautiful complexion, too.
Don't forget to apply Silka Green Premium Whitening Lotion SPF30 after!
Hindi na uso ang tiis-ganda! Get smarter about skincare and reap all the benefits of brighter skin without the pain.

Platelets are blood cells that help with clotting, and it is essential to maintain their levels. However, some people have thrombocytopenia, or a low platelet count, which means they have to find ways to increase their levels.
Eating certain foods may help increase a person's platelet count naturally.
Foods to eat to increase platelet count include:
folate-rich foods
foods rich in vitamins B-12, C, D, and K
iron-rich foods
Supplements of these nutrients are available and may help raise a person's platelet count.
Avoiding specific products, such as alcohol and the artificial sweetener aspartame, can also help to increase platelet count.
Foods to eat
Several vitamins and minerals can encourage a higher platelet count, including:
Folate-rich foods

Black-eyed peas are a folate-rich food. Black-eyed peas are a folate-rich food.
Folate is an essential B vitamin for healthy blood cells. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), adults require at least 400 micrograms (mcg) of folate daily, and pregnant women need 600 mcg.
Foods containing folate or folic acid include:
dark, leafy green vegetables, such as spinach and Brussels sprouts
beef liver
black-eyed peas
fortified breakfast cereals and dairy alternatives
rice
yeast
People should be careful not to consume excessive amounts of folic acid from supplements or fortified foods because high levels can interfere with vitamin B-12 function.
Eating lots of folate-rich foods does not cause problems.
Vitamin B-12-rich foods
Vitamin B-12 is necessary for the formation of red blood cells.
Low levels of B-12 in the body may also contribute to low platelet counts.
According to the NIH, people aged 14 and over require 2.4 mcg of vitamin B-12 daily. Pregnant and breastfeeding women require up to 2.8 mcg.
Vitamin B-12 is present in animal-based products, including:
beef and beef liver
eggs
fish, including clams, trout, salmon, and tuna
Dairy products also contain vitamin B-12, but some research suggests that cow's milk can affect the production of platelets.
Vegetarians and vegans can get vitamin B-12 from:
fortified cereals
fortified dairy alternatives, such as almond milk or soy milk
supplements
Vitamin C-rich foods
Vitamin C plays a vital role in the immune function. Vitamin C also helps the platelets work correctly and enhances the body's ability to absorb iron, which is another essential nutrient for platelets.
Many fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C, including:
broccoli
Brussels sprouts
citrus fruits, such as oranges and grapefruits
kiwifruit
red and green bell peppers
strawberries
Note that heat destroys vitamin C, so it may be best to eat vitamin C-rich foods raw when possible.
Vitamin D-rich foods
Vitamin D contributes to the proper functioning of the bones, muscles, nerves, and immune system.
According to the Platelet Disorder Support Association (PDSA), vitamin D also plays an essential role in the function of the bone marrow cells that produce platelets and other blood cells.
The body can produce vitamin D from sun exposure, but not everybody receives enough sunlight each day, especially if they live in colder climates or northern regions. Adults aged 19 to 70 require 15 mcg of vitamin D daily.
Food sources of vitamin D include:
egg yolk
fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel
fish liver oils
fortified milk and yogurt
Strict vegetarians and vegans can get vitamin D from:
fortified breakfast cereals
fortified orange juice
fortified dairy alternatives, such as soy milk and soy yogurt
supplements
UV-exposed mushrooms
Vitamin K-rich foods

Broccoli is rich in vitamin K Broccoli is rich in vitamin K
Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health.
According to an informal PDSA survey, 26.98 percent of people who took vitamin K reported an improvement in their platelet counts and bleeding symptoms.
Adequate intake of vitamin K for adults, aged 19 and over is 120 mcg for males and 90 mcg for females.
Foods rich in vitamin K include:
natto, a fermented soybean dish
leafy greens, such as collards, turnip greens, spinach, and kale
broccoli
soybeans and soybean oil
pumpkin
Iron-rich foods
Iron is essential for healthy levels of red blood cells and platelets. Research carried out on toddlers and teenagers with iron deficiency anemia suggests that iron might increase platelet count in those with this condition.
According to the NIH, males over 18 and females over 50 require 8 milligrams (mg) of iron daily, while females aged 19 to 50 need 18 mg. Women need 27 mg per day during pregnancy.
Iron-rich foods include:
oysters
beef liver
fortified breakfast cereals
white beans and kidney beans
dark chocolate
lentils
tofu
Eat vegetarian sources of iron, such as beans, lentils, and tofu, with a source of vitamin C to increase absorption rates. Avoid eating calcium-rich foods and taking calcium supplements at the same time as sources of iron.
Foods to avoid
Certain foods and drinks can reduce platelet counts including:
alcohol
aspartame, an artificial sweetener
cranberry juice
quinine, a substance in tonic water and bitter lemon
Supplements
Some research reports that certain supplements can increase platelet counts:
Supplements include:
Chlorophyll
Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in plants. Taking chlorophyll may alleviate some of the symptoms of a low platelet count, although research on its effectiveness is limited.
Algae-based supplements, such as chlorella, are rich in chlorophyll. The PDSA mentions chlorella as a potential supplement for those with low platelet count.
19 percent of people in their survey reported increased platelet counts, and 33 percent reported improvements in their bleeding symptoms after taking chlorella.
Papaya leaf extract
In research on mice, papaya leaf extract significantly increased platelet and red blood cell counts when compared to other mice. However, more research is needed, especially on human subjects.
Papaya leaf extract is available in health stores in pill form.
Melatonin
Melatonin is a hormone produced by the body that helps regulate the body's internal clock.
Some animal research reports a link between melatonin and increased platelet levels. However, more research is necessary to determine how useful it is for people with low platelet counts.
Melatonin is available in liquid, tablet, or topical form in health stores.
How to tell if your count is too low

A headache after minor injuries may be a symptom of a low platelet count. A headache after minor injuries may be a symptom of a low platelet count.
The symptoms of a low platelet count only occur when levels are particularly low. Mildly low levels often do not produce any symptoms.
When symptoms occur they include:
dark, red spots on the skin (petechiae)
headaches after minor injuries
easy bruising
spontaneous or excessive bleeding
bleeding from the mouth or nose after brushing teeth
People who experience symptoms should contact their doctor immediately. Low platelet count can cause severe complications without treatment.
Takeaway
People with a low platelet count may be able to improve their condition by eating specific foods and taking supplements. It can also be helpful to avoid alcohol, aspartame, and other foods that decrease platelet levels.
However, always seek medical advice first as diet alone may not be enough to restore normal platelet counts.

"This dish takes me right back to my childhood memories of tinned fruit in sweet syrup," says chef Sean Moran of Sean's in Bondi, Sydney. "This grown-up version gets a lot of its sweetness from honey, which is mixed through a coconut and mascarpone cream, and the only other sugar in the dish comes from a finger lime jelly – made by extracting the fruit's natural pectin. It also brings a joyful pop, a bit like the old glacé cherry on top of a sundae. Any fruit can be used in the base, provided it's fragrant and perfectly ripe."

You know the saying, "an apple a day keeps the doctor away?" Well in the case of breastfeeding mothers, it isn't just any âol apple. Or any âol fruit, in fact. Nope. All fruits are not created equal. Your needs as a breastfeeding mother are different than they used to be. And so, there are some stand out fruits to eat when you're breastfeeding.
As many new moms know, one of the most important goals during breastfeeding is maintaining an adequate milk supply. According to dietician and nutritionist, Brigitte Zeitlin, founder of BZ Nutrition, eating lean proteins, a wide array of veggies, and whole grains is imperative for breastfeeding moms and can really help keep up that milk supply. In addition to those foods, adding two servings (around two cups) of fruit per day can provide new moms and their babies with even more crucial nutrients. But as mentioned, not all fruits are created equal when it comes to breastfeeding benefits.
As a new mom, it may feel hard to find time to do anything during the day - even eat. So why not make sure you're really maximizing your meal and snack times. The great thing about eating a diet chock full of breastfeeding-geared nutrients is that both mama, and baby will get exactly what they need. So if you're looking for fruits that'll help with your flow, here are nine of the best fruits for breastfeeding moms to eat.
1. Oranges Pexels "These citrus gems are an excellent source of vitamin C which breastfeeding moms need a lot of, even more than when you were pregnant," says Zeitlin. According to Kid's Health, vitamin C plays a crucial role in growing healthy bones, teeth and muscles in all children, including newborns. Zeitlin says it can also help boost tissue growth and repair in breastfeeding moms. She also adds that new moms should aim for about 120 milligrams of vitamin C per day, which would be about two small oranges.
2. Apricots Pexels These smooth and sweet cuties pack some serious phytoestrogens, which mimic the activity of estrogen in the body. According to Zietlin, phytoestrogens help regulate milk producing hormones in the body and can increase lactation. Apricots are also full of calcium, potassium and vitamins C and A â all of which contribute to the optimal health for you and your baby.
3. Green Papaya Pixabay "Green papaya is a great source of galactogogue which helps induce lactation-enhancing milk production," Zeitlin says. She recommends adding 1/2 cup of green papaya to a smoothie with other galactogogue-rich foods like spinach and carrots. Add some unsweetened almond milk with 1/2 cup of greek yogurt and voila'. A delicious breakfast for breastfeeding mamas.
4. Blueberries Pexels The stand out benefit of blueberries is their antioxidant properties. Blueberries have the highest potency of antioxidants of any fruit, according to WebMD. Although the amount that passes through breastmilk is largely unknown, it's known that antioxidants do indeed pass through to the baby, which may help prevent disease in infancy according to a study in the Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition.
5. Strawberries Pexels Strawberries are a serious vitamin C powerhouse, and will help new moms meet their recommended 120 milligrams per day. Additionally, Zietlin says strawberries have a high water content, which helps with hydration. It's imperative breastfeeding mothers stay hydrated and healthy for themselves, and for their baby. Not getting enough water won't necessarily impact how much milk a mother makes. But ,according to Dr. Sears' website, if you're not getting enough fluids you could become fatigued.
6. Bananas Pexels Potassium is super important for pregnant women, but maintaining high levels of potassium is still crucial while breastfeeding. And actually, you need more of it as a breastfeeding mom, as it will help you maintain your fluid and electrolyte balance. According to Baby Center, the recommended amount of potassium is 5,100 milligrams. One medium banana contains about 450 milligrams of potassium, but don't think you have to turn into a monkey. The crucial mineral is found in several foods, including potatoes, which are the super-potassium packers.
7. Avocados Pixabay Many people think avocados are a vegetable. But, despite their outward appearance they're actually a fruit. Avocados pack a lot of potassium (more than the banana) at around 975 milligrams in a single avocado, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Additionally, avocados are a protein-filled fruit at four grams per serving, as shown by the USDA's nutrient database. Avocados are also a great source of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins and essential in cell growth for moms and babies.
8. Sapodilla Pixabay This is a more of an exotic fruit, but sapodillas won't disappoint when it comes to taste. Sapodilla is a higher-calorie fruit, according to USDA nutrient calculations, which is good for new moms and breastfeeding moms needing to make up the calories they are burning through breastfeeding (around 500 calories are burned per day through breastfeeding.) The fruit is also super high in fiber, which will help moms feel fuller and aid in preventing constipation.
