            "content": "Stefan eefting is, as he puts it, “a long-lasting guy” in the shipping industry. He started as an apprentice engineer in a German shipyard in 1984, and now he's a senior vice president at MAN Energy Solutions, a firm whose engines power every second vessel on the deep seas. Over the course of Eefting's career, he's watched ship engines grow from massive steel contraptions to epically huge ones: The 100,000-horsepower monsters in today's cargo ships are five or six times the size of a house. And for decades, the vast majority of them have ingested heavy fuel oil—the leftover dregs of petroleum distillation, a product so viscous it's practically a solid at room temperature. “Like chewing gum,” Eefting says. “You have to heat it to 140 or 150 degrees Celsius to even load it into the engine.”\n\nHeavy fuel oil burns thick and dirty, throwing off oxides of nitrogen and sulfur and producing more carbon emissions than almost any other fossil fuel. But it's cheaper than anything else on the market. When fuel is your industry's greatest cost—and when your industry guzzles 300 million metric tons of it a year—heavy oil is practically the only choice on the menu.\n\nSee more from The Climate Issue | April 2020. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nThat calculation changed, however, on January 1, when a new international regulation mandating low-sulfur fuel kicked in. Ship owners must now either install devices to scrub sulfur out of their heavy fuel oil exhaust or buy cleaner, more expensive fuel—at $600 or $700 a ton, compared to $400 a ton for heavy fuel oil. And that rule is just a foretaste of a massive transformation that is bearing down on Eefting's industry.\n\nSince the 1990s, ship owners have come under intense pressure to pollute the planet less. Container ships are indispensable to trade, and there's no greener mode of transport to move a freshly riveted pair of jeans from China to the US. But the world's 90,000 or so cargo ships contribute between 2 percent and 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions—more than the share contributed by Canada or Germany.\n\nWhile the sulfur cap is hitting shippers now, the far more daunting and impressive target is 30 years away. By 2050, the United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stipulated, the shipping industry's total emissions must be at least half of what they were in 2008. That goal is even more ambitious than it might sound. Trade will continue to grow even as 2050 approaches, says Johannah Christensen, the managing director of the nonprofit Global Maritime Forum. There will be many more ships at sea, making many more journeys, than there were in 2008. “What that translates to is actually an 85 percent reduction in emissions intensity per ship.”\n\nMeeting the deadline will require the industry to spend as much as $1.4 trillion on new fuel research and production, rejigged supply chains, and a revamped fleet—and no one even knows which solutions will work. The ambition, Christensen says, is “like a moon shot.”\n\nIn some ways, it's easier to decarbonize shipping than, say, automobiles or cement. The number of cargo ships in the world is small enough for them to be individually tracked, and they live so much of their lives in public—being inspected in one international port or another—that they can't slyly break rules the way a cement plant in a corrupt country might. Further, the ships are already regulated by a central authority: the IMO. The nature of this industry—in which ship owners routinely register their vessels under the flags of small countries with lax regulations—also means that the IMO is the rare forum where island nations threatened by rising seas hold significant sway. “Depending on the day you look at it, the Marshall Islands is the second- or third-largest flag register in the world,” says Bryan Comer, a senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation. “And they were instrumental in making the moral argument for reducing emissions at the IMO. If they'd had their way, in fact, they'd have wanted a 100 percent cut, and much before 2050.”\n\nThe WIRED Guide to Climate Change The world is getting warmer, the weather is getting worse. Here's everything you need to know about what humans can do to stop wrecking the planet.\n\nEven so, it's an unusual challenge for an industry to adopt an emissions target while having no clear notion of the technologies that will get it there. Borrowing ideas from other sectors isn't practical. Batteries are out. A container ship crossing the Atlantic would need so many batteries that it would have no room left for containers. Nuclear power, too, is dead in the water—“for political reasons,” says Simon Bennett, the deputy secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping. “The idea of foreign ships coming into your port with a nuclear reactor on board—that just won't be acceptable.”\n\nThe solution most immediately at hand, liquefied natural gas, emits less carbon dioxide than fuel oil, and ship engines can be retrofitted fairly easily to burn it. But carbon emissions from liquefied natural gas are only about 30 percent less than from heavy fuel oil. What's more, the primary component of liquefied natural gas, methane, is highly prone to “slip,” or leak. Atmospheric methane traps 86 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. At best, says Eefting, liquid natural gas is only a temporary answer—an intermediate station on a zero-carbon pathway.\n\nThe fuels with more long-term promise are ammonia and hydrogen, which, when burned, release no carbon emissions at all. MAN plans to deliver its first ammonia engine in 2024. But there's still plenty to be figured out: To be truly green, these fuels will themselves have to be manufactured with no carbon footprint—something the IMO can't regulate. Ammonia production is one of the most carbon-intensive processes in industrial chemistry and is the subject of its own slogging race for sustainable modifications. Meanwhile, ships and ports will have to devise new ways of handling and storing ammonia, given how toxic it is to humans. “Plus, you have to remember,” Eefting says, “ammonia stinks very much.” Hydrogen, for its part, is highly flammable and would require huge, special tanks. “Its molecules are so small that they can leak out of virtually anything,” Eefting adds. “And you need to compress it or cool it to minus-253 degrees Celsius to have a decent energy density.”"

However, when cutouts are made the container can loose it strength so reinforcements usually need to be made. Since it is just a metal box you need to insulate it. This is done with an interior wall with insulation behind it.\n\n\n\nI like this design by Pin-Up Houses.

The service works with a wide range of Scaleway instances and lets you create large clusters that scale depending on demand.\n\nKubernetes is an open-source platform to manage containers and the server infrastructure behind those containers. Building an application using containers lets you divide your application into multiple applications and services that you can deploy and upgrade individually without interacting with the main operating system of the server.\n\nAnd thanks to Kubernetes, you can spin up more nodes (more servers) and containers to scale your infrastructure. This way, you always have enough resources to handle peaks. It also can scale down your cluster to save money.\n\nScaleway’s managed Kubernetes service is free of charge, which means you only have to pay for nodes that you use. Scaleway scales your cluster, checks that your nodes are working as expected every 15 minutes and gives you a web dashboard to monitor your cluster.\n\nThe company also says that there’s some redundancy for the control plane so that it remains available if your control plane fails (99.95% SLA). It supports 500 nodes at a time.\n\nKapsule supports Scaleway’s cloud instances, GPU-based instances, block storage and load balancers. The company also provides a container registry to store your container images. You could imagine building a cluster that looks like this:\n\nKapsule respects the Cloud Native Computing Foundation standards, which means that you can migrate existing CNCF clusters to Scaleway, or you could build a multi-cloud infrastructure.\n\nA managed Kubernetes service could help Scaleway attract more enterprise and large-scale clients. It could be particularly useful for clients looking for another cloud hosting provider to add some redundancy."

            "content": "r-bloggers | STATWORX, and kindly contributed to Want to share your content on R-bloggers? [This article was first published on, and kindly contributed to R-bloggers ]. (You can report issue about the content on this page here Want to share your content on R-bloggers? click here if you have a blog, or here if you don't.\n\nRecently, some colleagues and I attended the 2-day COVID-19 hackathon #wirvsvirus, organized by the German government. Thereby, we’ve developed a great application for simulating COVID-19 curves based on estimations of governmental measure effectiveness (FlatCurver). As there are many COVID-related dashboards and visualizations out there, I thought that gathering the underlying data from a single point of truth would be a minor issue. However, I soon realized that there are plenty of different data sources, mostly relying on the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 case data. At first, I thought that’s great, but at a second glance, I revised my initial thought. The JHU datasets have some quirky issues to it that makes it a bit cumbersome to prepare and analyze it:\n\nweird column names including special characters\n\ncountries and states „in the mix“\n\nwide format, quite unhandy for data analysis\n\nimport problems due to line break issues\n\netc.\n\nFor all of you, who have been or are working with COVID-19 time series data and want to step up your data-pipeline game, let me tell you: we have an API for that! The API uses official data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and delivers a clear and concise data structure for further processing, analysis, etc.\n\nOverview of our COVID-19 API\n\nOur brand new COVID-19-API brings you the latest case number time series right into your application or analysis, regardless of your development environment. For example, you can easily import the data into Python using the requests package:\n\nimport requests import json import pandas as pd # POST to API payload = {'country': 'Germany'} # or {'code': 'DE'} URL = 'https://api.statworx.com/covid' response = requests.post(url=URL, data=json.dumps(payload)) # Convert to data frame df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(json.loads(response.text))\n\nOr if you’re an R aficionado, use httr and jsonlite to grab the lastest data and turn it into a cool plot.\n\nlibrary(httr) library(dplyr) library(jsonlite) library(ggplot2) # Post to API payload % mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% filter(cases_cum > 100) %>% filter(code %in% c(\"US\", \"DE\", \"IT\", \"FR\", \"ES\")) %>% group_by(code) %>% mutate(time = 1:n()) %>% ggplot(., aes(x = time, y = cases_cum, color = code)) + xlab(\"Days since 100 cases\") + ylab(\"Cumulative cases\") + geom_line() + theme_minimal()\n\nDeveloping the API using Flask\n\nDeveloping a simple web app using Python is straightforward using Flask. Flask is a web framework for Python. It allows you to create websites, web applications, etc. right from Python. Flask is widely used to develop web services and APIs. A simple Flask app looks something like this.\n\nfrom flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def handle_request(): \"\"\" This code gets executed \"\"\" return 'Your first Flask app!'\n\nIn the example above, app.route decorator defines at which URL our function should be triggered. You can specify multiple decorators to trigger different functions for each URL. You might want to check out our code in the Github repository to see how we build the API using Flask.\n\nDeployment using Google Cloud Run\n\nDeveloping the API using Flask is straightforward. However, building the infrastructure and auxiliary services around it can be challenging, depending on your specific needs. A couple of things you have to consider when deploying an API:\n\nAuthentification\n\nSecurity\n\nScalability\n\nLatency\n\nLogging\n\nConnectivity\n\nWe’ve decided to use Google Cloud Run, a container-based serverless computing framework on Google Cloud. Basically, GCR is a fully managed Kubernetes service, that allows you to deploy scalable web services or other serverless functions based on your container. This is how our Dockerfile looks like.\n\n# Use the official image as a parent image FROM python:3.7 # Copy the file from your host to your current location COPY ./main.py /app/main.py COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt # Set the working directory WORKDIR /app # Run the command inside your image filesystem RUN pip install -r requirements.txt # Inform Docker that the container is listening on the specified port at runtime. EXPOSE 80 # Run the specified command within the container. CMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\n\nYou can develop your container locally and then push it in to the container registry of your GCP project. To do so, you have to tag your local image using docker tag according to the following scheme: [HOSTNAME]/[PROJECT-ID]/[IMAGE] . The hostname is one of the following: gcr.io , us.gcr.io , eu.gcr.io , asia.gcr.io . Afterward, you can push using gcloud push , followed by your image tag. From there, you can easily connect the container to the Google Cloud Run service:\n\nWhen deploying the service, you can define parameters for scaling, etc. However, this is not in scope for this post. Furthermore, GCR allows custom domain mapping to functions. That’s why we have the neat API endpoint https://api.statworx.com/covid .\n\nConclusion\n\nBuilding and deploying a web service is easier than ever. We hope that you find our new API useful for your projects and analyses regarding COVID-19. If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to contact us or to open an issue on Github.

Upon a search, authorities said they found an open container of alcohol in Jones’ car and a firearm. He was arrested after a sobriety test was conducted.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jones agreed to plead guilty to DWI, avoiding jail time, if he follows the terms of the agreement, according to ESPN. Along with a $500 fine, Jones will serve 96 straight hours in a house arrest–like program along with 48 hours of community service and complete a 90-day outpatient treatment program.\n\nJones was also charged with possession of an open container, failure to provide proof of insurance and negligent use of a firearm. All of the charges have since been dropped, ESPN reported.\n\n“His attorney and Mr. Jones have been made aware that if he fails to do this, the state will seek to impose the balance of any jail time without regard for any exceptional circumstances,” a spokesperson for the Bernalillo County District Attorney’s office said, according to the outlet.\n\nRELATED: Second Suspect Arrested on Kidnapping Charges in Case of UFC Fighter’s Missing Stepdaughter\n\nOpening up about the arrest, Jones said that he is “truly disappointed” in himself.\n\n“While we all work to understand and cope with stress and uncertainties surrounding the current state of our world,” he told PEOPLE in a statement, “I want to express how truly disappointed I am that I have become the source of a negative headline again, especially during these trying times.”\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE’s free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories\n\n“I am disappointed for letting down the people I care about the most, my family, friends and my fans,” he continued. “… I accept full responsibility for my actions and I know that I have some personal work to do to which involves the unhealthy relationship I have with alcohol.”\n\nJones said moving forward, he “will not allow this personal setback to hinder my work within the community when we need it most.”\n\n“I truly appreciate the support I have received from the community of Albuquerque and all my fans around the world,” he said. “I very much look forward to putting this behind me.
