            "content": "A previous version of this report incorrectly attributed to Google a new approach to climate-change policy that the company had not undertaken. A third party, posing as Google, made the announcement.\n\nMarketWatch and other technology and investing sites misreported earlier Wednesday that Google parent Alphabet would cut ties with lobbyists and think tanks that deny accelerating man-made climate change.\n\nThe search giant GOOGL, -0.48% GOOG, -0.59% also reportedly had announced plans to cut ties with fossil-fuel sources. Except it did not make that announcement.\n\nThe posting was a prank put out by the New York City arm of a climate protest group, which has called out Google’s practices before.\n\nNews sites generally believed that, amid the coronavirus pandemic, April Fools Day parody releases, for which media outlets are on alert at this time of year, would be rare or nonexistent this year given the rising U.S. death toll. At the same time, attention remains fixed on technology firms and their sustainability efforts after Microsoft MSFT, -0.72% and others have announced zero- or net-positive carbon emissions and other initiatives.\n\nAnd:Microsoft aims to be ‘carbon negative’ by 2030\n\nStill, MarketWatch should have given more scrutiny than usual to any release of this nature, no matter its apparent seriousness. Such coverage is not fair to readers who are trying to discern the science-based facts on both coronavirus and the long-run effects of climate change. We can all be more responsible.\n\nRead:Amazon has ‘ambitious but achievable’ plan to hit Paris climate goals 10 years early and go carbon neutral by 2040\n\nLate last year, more than 1,000 Google workers signed a public letter calling on their employer to commit to an aggressive “company-wide climate plan” that includes canceling contracts with the fossil fuel industry and halting its donations to climate-change deniers, including those in Wednesday’s protest release. That letter had urged neutral emissions by 2030.\n\nGoogle does also use some renewable energy, announcing in 2018 that it purchases more renewable energy than it consumes as a company.\n\nRead:Trump to meet with CEOs of oil companies over helping the industry"

            "content": "The Asian continent spans a vast geographical area. The novel coronavirus emerged in the eastern part – Wuhan, China – and quickly spread to other countries within a couple of months after first reported cases in December. In Asia’s western reaches lie the Maldives, long the posterchild of the international climate change establishment which claims, among other things, that the low-lying tourist islands will be submerged as sea-levels rapidly rise with global warming.\n\nAsian governments now face stark trade-offs, as the needs of an immediate, potentially catastrophic health crisis (and its devastating economic fallout) compete with the policy requirements of what the climate industrial complex deems as an equally threatening existential threat of “climate crisis”. As Asian policymakers grapple with immediate measures to handle the epidemic with unprecedented lockdowns of entire cities, provinces or even nationwide, they are no doubt keenly observing how their counterparts in the US and Europe are meeting this common challenge. Few if any of the developments in the West will inspire confidence.\n\nThe US Congress passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package which was signed by President Trump last Friday. But this was only after a week of partisan delay caused by the Democrats’ insistence on provisions that had little to do with handling the pandemic. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi failed in her bid to incorporate climate change provisions in the stimulus bill. In an expansive wish list, the bill included new tax credits for solar and wind energy and emissions standards for airlines by 2025 as part of the party’s Green New Deal ambitions.\n\nTo be fair, Ms Pelosi is not alone in the cynical attempt to “never let a good crisis go to waste”. Across the pond, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen doubled down on the EU’s climate commitment with a €1 trillion Green Deal. She presented the European Climate Law on March 4th, when the Wuhan virus was fast metastasizing into a global pandemic. The law, which would legally bind EU members to net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, was presented by Ms. von Leyen while flanked by none other than teenage Green icon Greta Thunberg. In an odd twist of logic, Frans Timmermans, leading the Commission’s work on the European Green Deal, said that the focus on the coronavirus pandemic “showed the need for climate laws”. In the revolutionary language of the EC’s Green Deal, all policy matters including coronavirus-related public health and economic stimulus legislation would have to be in line with net zero emissions by mid-century.\n\nInternational bureaucrats have echoed these calls for stiffening the resolve to pursue climate legislation in the face of the mounting Covid-19 crisis. Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency and a prominent climate policy advocate, advised world leaders and heads of financial institutions to exploit the “historic opportunity” presented by the pandemic and “use the current situation to step up our ambition to tackle climate change.” Christiana Figueres, former head of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and architect of the Paris Agreement, tweeted “Well put @IEABirol…We have a massive crisis = opportunity on our hands. We cannot afford to waste it. Recovery must be green.”\n\nNot surprisingly, these incessant calls for governments to finance ever-greater ambitions in emission reductions while the coronavirus pandemic imposes immediate hardships on afflicted countries have led to strong objections. One EU diplomat put it baldly: \"We simply don't have the money to do everything.\" Another said that \"Maybe it will be less on Green Deal but more on trying to restart the economies…We cannot just continue with the plans and programmes we had so far. They were developed for a world without coronavirus.\"\n\nPoland’s government, never a fan of the EU’s Green ambitions, stated that the country — heavily dependent on coal-fired power generation — would not be able to achieve the EU’s climate change goals because of the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on its economy. Holland, a richer European economy at the forefront of the EU’s climate ambitions, cited the toll of the virus pandemic in announcing that no new measures will be taken to reduce emissions. Bavaria’s Chief Minister called on the federal government to provide relief from the deepening pandemic crisis by suspending carbon taxes and renewable energy subsidies which have made electricity rates in Germany among the world’s highest.\n\nFor policymakers around the world, the Covid-19 pandemic has provided a reality check, a painful reminder of what a real existential crisis looks and feels like. Inevitably, the global focus on the Covid-19 pandemic has come at the expense of attention paid to hypothetical model-based notions of a future “climate emergency”. Perhaps the most consequential price to be paid on the trade-off between the two policy objectives will be in Asia, the world’s most populous continent.\n\nJapan, the world’s third largest economy and one of its richest, is the first major signatory of the Paris Agreement to submit updated plans on cutting emissions in preparation for the now-postponed November 2020 Glasgow meeting. It was widely criticised by climate campaigners for failing to intensify emission targets as called for by the ‘spirit’ of the Paris Agreement. Many an Asian policymaker will see Japan’s refusal to submit tighter emissions reduction targets in view of the Covid-19 pandemic as pragmatic and necessary.\n\nChina, the world’s second largest economy and its biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, plans a fiscal stimulus worth hundreds of billions of dollars to restore economic growth. Given the country’s economic structure as the ‘workshop of the world’, this implies the resuscitation of carbon-intensive activity, ranging from coal to oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, plastics, and refineries — and reviving jobs for the multitudes who work in automobiles, aviation, shipping, utilities, construction, agriculture, manufacturing and utilities. Hence it is no surprise that China plans to postpone automobile emission standards and “save the industry” post-Covid-19.\n\nIn the emerging countries of Asia, among the impoverished masses without access to reliable and affordable electricity systems needed to power modern medical care, the lethality of the Covid-19 pandemic can only be imagined at this stage. Vast swaths of Asia lack clean water, sanitation systems, and refrigeration for vaccines, let alone respirators and personal protective equipment for front line medical workers. These cannot be provided at scale by solar or windmill farms. The strictures against fossil fuels, as part of the liturgy of climate change belief, are egregious to the extreme when the real and immediate challenge of coping with Covid-19 faces each and every Asian today.\n\n\n\n"

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nPolicymakers in the world’s biggest auto market may also delay the implementation of a new emission particle restriction by six months to help the car industry, which has suffered a 79% drop in sales in February and expects a fall of around 10% in the first half of this year.\n\nThe United States had already planned to relax vehicle emissions rules. President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday completed a rollback of vehicle emissions standards adopted under predecessor Barack Obama. This will require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - much weaker than the 5% increases under the previous regime.\n\n“Policymakers acknowledged that automakers are strained to promote electric models when overall demand is slowing. They want the auto industry to recover steadily this year,” one of the four people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAuthorities are still reviewing the details of the plan, which has yet to be finalised, sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The review is being discussed with officials at industry and environment ministries as well as automakers and industry bodies.\n\nThe policy shift comes as Xin Guobin, vice industry minister, said on Monday that China would “make adjustments on new energy vehicles and related policies to further promote the coordinated and healthy development of the automotive industry.”\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nChina requires automakers doing business in the country to follow strict rules covering the production of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) as part of a quota system.\n\nChina hopes NEVs, such as battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell cars, will account for around a quarter of all cars sold in the country in 2025, up sharply from 5% in 2019.\n\nAs a result carmakers, including Tesla (TSLA.O), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), General Motors (GM.N), Toyota (7203.T) and Geely [GEELY.UL], have increased EV production. But the system has also been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve gasoline cars’ efficiency.\n\nThe change in policy is largely aimed at helping automakers focus on selling more profitable gasoline cars to improve their cash flow. But a small group of companies — mostly Chinese automakers such as BYD (002594.SZ) — are already making money from electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe temporary easing of NEV quotas is likely to allow companies to delay new model launches, which have more costly technology than conventional vehicles, and also discourage them from aggressive marketing.\n\nChina’s vice industry minister Xin said the auto industry still faced great difficulties and challenges.\n\n“Even though production has resumed to a relatively high level, it is possible that some enterprises would cut production in the subsequent period due to insufficient market demand and increased inventories,” he said.\n\nTo spur demand, China said late on Tuesday that it will extend subsidies for NEV purchases and extend their purchase tax exemption for two years."

Last month China sales and production were badly impacted and as China now recovers, global sales and production are now being impacted. This has meant that the German manufacturers have moved towards the top of the sales leader board and the Chinese have fallen, at least for now.\n\nThe other big news was both the UK and China extending subsidies for EVs.\n\nGlobal electric car sales as of end February 2020\n\nGlobal electric car sales finished February 2020 with 116,000 for the month, up 16% in February 2019, with a market share of 1.6% for February 2020, and 1.8% YTD.\n\nOf note 64% of all global electric car sales in February 2020 were 100% battery electric vehicles [BEVs], the balance being hybrids.\n\nChina's electric car sales were 15,000 in February 2020, down 65% in February 2019 due to the coronavirus lockdown. Conventional car sales were down 82%. Electric car market share in China for February actually rose to 6.6%, and 3.7% YTD.\n\nSubsidies in China were reduced by 20% in 2017 and were reduced again on June 25, 2019. On March 31, 2020 China extended the subsidies for 2 years. China's Zero Emission Vehicle credit system (NEV credit scheme) in 2020 required 12 points of credits from new energy vehicles [NEVs]. It is currently under consideration to be increased (14 in 2021, 16 in 2022 and 18 in 2023). A December 2019 report from Reuters stated: \"China wants new energy vehicle sales in 2025 to be 25% of all car sales.\"\n\nEurope's electric car sales were 69,000 in February 2020, 111% higher than in February 2019. Europe's electric car market share was 6.5% in February, and 6.5% YTD. Norway still leads the world with an incredible 68% market share in February 2020.\n\nUS electric car sales were not reported by EV Sales in February 2020 as it appears many ICE brands don't want to publish their EV sales numbers.\n\nNote: The above sales include light commercial vehicles.\n\nNote: An acknowledgement to Jose Pontes of EV Sales and EV Volumes for his excellent work compiling all the electric car sales quoted above and below.\n\nGlobal electric car sales by manufacturer for February 2020\n\nSource: EV-Sales Blogspot\n\nEV sales forecast to really take off from 2022 as affordability kicks in\n\nThe chart below aligns with my research that electric car sales will really take-off after 2022, when my model forecasts electric and ICE car price parity.\n\nSource\n\nBloomberg's forecast for annual electric vehicle sales is 10m by 2025, 28m by 2030, and 56m by 2040.

According to the latest media reports, based on unofficial sources, the Chinese government is currently considering an extension of the subsidies. The original plan was to gradually phase out the incentives by the end of 2020, but taking into consideration the outcome and then the coronavirus, China probably will not only abandon the plans to lower EV subsidies but extend the 25,000 yuan incentive for BEVs with NEDC range of 400 km (250 miles).\n\nOn March 2, Investing News reported:\n\nRobert Friedland: Copper is the EV story, demand to rise 900 percent. The dreams of EV makers are not going to become a reality without copper, nickel, lithium and cobalt among other metals, according to Friedland. According to Friedland, by 2030 the Earth’s population will reach 8.5 billion, with at least 5 billion people living in urban areas. As the population grows, the need for quality clean air will increase. Friedland mentioned that nine out of 10 people in the world are breathing polluted air, with some studies showing that it is killing more people than smoking, wars and AIDs combined. The founder of Ivanhoe mentioned how major miners are divesting coal assets or looking for ways to reduce emissions, while carmakers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (OTC Pink:VLKAF,FWB:VOW) continue to make announcements about upcoming electric car models, which are expected to number 230 by 2021.\n\nOn March 11, Argus Media reported:\n\nThe UK government has unveiled an extension of its grant scheme for plug-in vehicles in its budget announcement today. The grant of up to 35pc of the vehicle's value — but with a cap at £3,500 ($4,500) — will be extended until the 2022-23 financial year, overhauling previous plans to abolish it. The grant is available to buyers of any vehicle which emits less than 50g/km of CO2 and can travel at least 112km without any emissions at all. All battery electric vehicles and most plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are eligible. The grant also applies to motorcycles, mopeds and electric taxis. The budget also included an exemption for zero-emission cars from vehicle excise duty, which charges additional taxes on higher-value cars. And UK chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £500mn investment over five years to support the rollout of a fast-charging network for electric vehicles (EVs), on top of a £1bn investment announced in September 2019 to scale-up EV production in the UK.\n\nOn March 17, Bloomberg reported:\n\nAn economic crash will slow down the electric vehicle revolution... But not for long. The coronavirus pandemic presents risks but won’t change the longer term trajectory... Sales in Europe still are expected to increase 50% from last year and China sales could be flat or drop if the recovery from the virus drags on.\n\nNote: The chart below shows the magic USD100/kWh being in 2023.

            "content": "The global coronavirus pandemic has put our economy in free-fall.\n\nEven through Donald Trump's reckless economic policies, like his pointless trade war with China or his deficit-busting tax cuts for his billionaire donors, the economy has somehow managed to keep chugging along — until now.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAll of the stock market gains from Trump's time in office have been wiped out, and over the course of just over one week in March the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its five largest drops in history.\n\nWorse than a plummeting stock market, businesses and major industries have been forced to shutter their windows to help combat the rapid spread of the virus, putting hundreds of thousands of workers' paychecks at risk.\n\nA recession is inevitable at this point. Here are 3 things we can do to prepare.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nNumber one: We need to reform unemployment insurance so it reflects the needs of today's economy.\n\nWhen it was first created in 1935, unemployment insurance was designed to help full-time workers weather downturns until they got their old jobs back. But there are fewer full-time jobs in today's economy, and fewer people who are laid off get their old jobs back again.\n\nAs a result, only 27% of unemployed workers receive benefits today, compared to 49% of workers in the 1950s. We need to expand unemployment coverage so that everyone is protected.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nNumber two: We need to strengthen Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, also known as public assistance.\n\nSince its creation in 1996, the number of families receiving cash assistance has declined dramatically – and not because they're doing well. Between 2006 and 2018, just 13% of families were lifted out of poverty, while the number of families receiving public assistance fell by 39%.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAlready weak, the program didn't hold up well during the Great Recession. Funding doesn't automatically expand during economic downturns – meaning the more families are in need, the less money there is to help them. The program also has strict work requirements, which can't be fulfilled in a deep recession. Worse yet, many individuals in need have already exhausted their five years of lifetime eligibility for assistance.\n\nWe need to reform the public assistance program so that more families in need are eligible. It should be easier to waive the strict work eligibility requirements during the economic downturn, and the lifetime five-year limit should be suspended.\n\nNumber three: We need to protect the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nUnlike public assistance, SNAP responded well during the Great Recession. Its requirements are designed to expand during economic downturns or recessions.\n\nWaiving work requirements during the Great Recession made thousands of people in need eligible for the program who otherwise wouldn't have been. Between December 2007 and December 2009, the number of SNAP participants rose by 45%. The program helped keep an estimated 3.8 million families out of poverty in 2009.\n\nBut that might not be an option this time around, as SNAP has come under attack from the Trump administration, which is trying to enact a draconian rule change that would kick an estimated 700,000 of our most vulnerable citizens off of the program. Luckily, a judge blocked the rule from going into effect, but the administration is still fighting to enforce it — even in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to make sure SNAP's flexibility and ability to respond to economic downturns is protected before the next recession hits.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nStronger safety nets are not only good for individuals and families in need. They will also prevent the looming recession from becoming an even deeper and longer economic crisis."

President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday completed a rollback of vehicle emissions standards adopted under predecessor Barack Obama. This will require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - much weaker than the 5% increases under the previous regime.\n\n\"Policymakers acknowledged that automakers are strained to promote electric models when overall demand is slowing. They want the auto industry to recover steadily this year,\" one of the four people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAuthorities are still reviewing the details of the plan, which has yet to be finalised, sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The review is being discussed with officials at industry and environment ministries as well as automakers and industry bodies.\n\nThe policy shift comes as Xin Guobin, vice industry minister, said on Monday that China would \"make adjustments on new energy vehicles and related policies to further promote the coordinated and healthy development of the automotive industry.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nChina requires automakers doing business in the country to follow strict rules covering the production of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) as part of a quota system.\n\nChina hopes NEVs, such as battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell cars, will account for around a quarter of all cars sold in the country in 2025, up sharply from 5% in 2019.\n\nAs a result carmakers, including Tesla, Volkswagen, General Motors, Toyota and Geely, have increased EV production. But the system has also been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve gasoline cars' efficiency.\n\nThe change in policy is largely aimed at helping automakers focus on selling more profitable gasoline cars to improve their cash flow. But a small group of companies -- mostly Chinese automakers such as BYD -- are already making money from electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe temporary easing of NEV quotas is likely to allow companies to delay new model launches, which have more costly technology than conventional vehicles, and also discourage them from aggressive marketing.\n\nChina's vice industry minister Xin said the auto industry still faced great difficulties and challenges.\n\n\"Even though production has resumed to a relatively high level, it is possible that some enterprises would cut production in the subsequent period due to insufficient market demand and increased inventories,\" he said.\n\nTo spur demand, China said late on Tuesday that it will extend subsidies for NEV purchases and extend their purchase tax exemption for two years.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jane Merriman)"
