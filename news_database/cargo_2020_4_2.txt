            "content": "Stefan eefting is, as he puts it, “a long-lasting guy” in the shipping industry. He started as an apprentice engineer in a German shipyard in 1984, and now he's a senior vice president at MAN Energy Solutions, a firm whose engines power every second vessel on the deep seas. Over the course of Eefting's career, he's watched ship engines grow from massive steel contraptions to epically huge ones: The 100,000-horsepower monsters in today's cargo ships are five or six times the size of a house. And for decades, the vast majority of them have ingested heavy fuel oil—the leftover dregs of petroleum distillation, a product so viscous it's practically a solid at room temperature. “Like chewing gum,” Eefting says. “You have to heat it to 140 or 150 degrees Celsius to even load it into the engine.”\n\nHeavy fuel oil burns thick and dirty, throwing off oxides of nitrogen and sulfur and producing more carbon emissions than almost any other fossil fuel. But it's cheaper than anything else on the market. When fuel is your industry's greatest cost—and when your industry guzzles 300 million metric tons of it a year—heavy oil is practically the only choice on the menu.\n\nSee more from The Climate Issue | April 2020. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nThat calculation changed, however, on January 1, when a new international regulation mandating low-sulfur fuel kicked in. Ship owners must now either install devices to scrub sulfur out of their heavy fuel oil exhaust or buy cleaner, more expensive fuel—at $600 or $700 a ton, compared to $400 a ton for heavy fuel oil. And that rule is just a foretaste of a massive transformation that is bearing down on Eefting's industry.\n\nSince the 1990s, ship owners have come under intense pressure to pollute the planet less. Container ships are indispensable to trade, and there's no greener mode of transport to move a freshly riveted pair of jeans from China to the US. But the world's 90,000 or so cargo ships contribute between 2 percent and 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions—more than the share contributed by Canada or Germany.\n\nWhile the sulfur cap is hitting shippers now, the far more daunting and impressive target is 30 years away. By 2050, the United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stipulated, the shipping industry's total emissions must be at least half of what they were in 2008. That goal is even more ambitious than it might sound. Trade will continue to grow even as 2050 approaches, says Johannah Christensen, the managing director of the nonprofit Global Maritime Forum. There will be many more ships at sea, making many more journeys, than there were in 2008. “What that translates to is actually an 85 percent reduction in emissions intensity per ship.”\n\nMeeting the deadline will require the industry to spend as much as $1.4 trillion on new fuel research and production, rejigged supply chains, and a revamped fleet—and no one even knows which solutions will work. The ambition, Christensen says, is “like a moon shot.”\n\nIn some ways, it's easier to decarbonize shipping than, say, automobiles or cement. The number of cargo ships in the world is small enough for them to be individually tracked, and they live so much of their lives in public—being inspected in one international port or another—that they can't slyly break rules the way a cement plant in a corrupt country might. Further, the ships are already regulated by a central authority: the IMO. The nature of this industry—in which ship owners routinely register their vessels under the flags of small countries with lax regulations—also means that the IMO is the rare forum where island nations threatened by rising seas hold significant sway. “Depending on the day you look at it, the Marshall Islands is the second- or third-largest flag register in the world,” says Bryan Comer, a senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation. “And they were instrumental in making the moral argument for reducing emissions at the IMO. If they'd had their way, in fact, they'd have wanted a 100 percent cut, and much before 2050.”\n\nThe WIRED Guide to Climate Change The world is getting warmer, the weather is getting worse. Here's everything you need to know about what humans can do to stop wrecking the planet.\n\nEven so, it's an unusual challenge for an industry to adopt an emissions target while having no clear notion of the technologies that will get it there. Borrowing ideas from other sectors isn't practical. Batteries are out. A container ship crossing the Atlantic would need so many batteries that it would have no room left for containers. Nuclear power, too, is dead in the water—“for political reasons,” says Simon Bennett, the deputy secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping. “The idea of foreign ships coming into your port with a nuclear reactor on board—that just won't be acceptable.”\n\nThe solution most immediately at hand, liquefied natural gas, emits less carbon dioxide than fuel oil, and ship engines can be retrofitted fairly easily to burn it. But carbon emissions from liquefied natural gas are only about 30 percent less than from heavy fuel oil. What's more, the primary component of liquefied natural gas, methane, is highly prone to “slip,” or leak. Atmospheric methane traps 86 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. At best, says Eefting, liquid natural gas is only a temporary answer—an intermediate station on a zero-carbon pathway.\n\nThe fuels with more long-term promise are ammonia and hydrogen, which, when burned, release no carbon emissions at all. MAN plans to deliver its first ammonia engine in 2024. But there's still plenty to be figured out: To be truly green, these fuels will themselves have to be manufactured with no carbon footprint—something the IMO can't regulate. Ammonia production is one of the most carbon-intensive processes in industrial chemistry and is the subject of its own slogging race for sustainable modifications. Meanwhile, ships and ports will have to devise new ways of handling and storing ammonia, given how toxic it is to humans. “Plus, you have to remember,” Eefting says, “ammonia stinks very much.” Hydrogen, for its part, is highly flammable and would require huge, special tanks. “Its molecules are so small that they can leak out of virtually anything,” Eefting adds. “And you need to compress it or cool it to minus-253 degrees Celsius to have a decent energy density.”"

            "content": "Another word for “Cargo,” a truly unique blend of Hindu mythology and mid-concept science fiction about a futuristic new process by which the recently deceased are beamed onto a spaceship far away in order to have their memories wiped and their souls cleansed for reincarnation, might be “baggage” — as in, dead people show up with their hands and pockets full of whatever preoccupied them on Earth, and it’s the crew’s job to calm them down and ease them through the transition.\n\n“Cargo” takes place aboard a nifty retro-styled space ship — with its rudimentary computer terminals and mid-20th-century corded phone receivers — called the Pushpak 634A, whose lone crew member is a demon named Prahastha (Vikrant Massey). Demons, according to writer-director Arati Kadav’s playfully revisionist premise, once sneaked around at night stealing humans’ souls, but now, thanks to a treaty between their kind and Homo sapiens, they catalog and process these transitional spirits from the outer reaches of space.\n\nEarly on, Kadav shows Prahastha floating around like Sandra Bullock in “Gravity,” as he fixes one of the solar panels on the exterior of her CG ship. It’s not clear why the character needs to trouble himself with such things, but it’s a nice bit of visual detail in a movie that manages to stretch its modest budget to rather extraordinary lengths. The film “Cargo” will most likely remind you of is Duncan Jones’ “Moon.” Kadav has clearly seen it, although there’s an entire subgenre of design-forward, “It’s lonely out in space” sagas (from “Solaris” to “Silent Running” to “Passengers” to, most obviously, “2001: A Space Odyssey”) that may have influenced her own vision of this solitary rocket-demon suffering an existential crisis at the far reaches of the solar system.\n\nMassey is an appealing actor, but rather one-note in the role, playing an obedient functionary — like one of those extras who silently mans the consoles in the background of a “Star Trek” episode — who’s considered a hero (he has fans back on terra firma) but doesn’t see much point in fussing over his job. Kadav treats the deaths in “Cargo” as kind of a running joke. She doesn’t show the briefly glimpsed human characters dying per se, but instead re-creates the moment just before they bite the dust: an old geezer about to take a tumble down a rickety flight of stairs, a young man stepping into a faulty elevator or a series of near misses that ends with the squealing brakes of a bus accident. (There’s even an unfortunate inventor, whose arrival by electrocution seems to be an inside-joke wink to her 2016 short film “Time Machine.” The device misfires, and he winds up in “Cargo.”)\n\nWhen these victims of fate show up in the arrival bay of the Pushpak 634A, they don’t know what’s happened, and Prahastha ambivalently ushers them through the process, showing minimal curiosity about the visitors he’s processing. His first guest is an elderly magician, whose personal effects include one of those endless silk handkerchiefs stuffed up his sleeve and a white pigeon. It feels like an opportunity missed that these newly dead arrivals don’t seem more attached to the lives they’ve just lost, although several are determined to place a final phone call to a friend or loved one.\n\n“Cargo” never explains how that works exactly. The movie isn’t interested in logistics. Rather, Kadav is concerned with the state of Prahastha’s soul, and to help reveal it, she has his boss (Nandu Madhav) send him an assistant, a young medical Raksha — another demon, this one female, with magical healing powers — named Yuvishka (Shweta Tripathi). The moment they meet, composer Shezan Shaikh’s synthesizer score starts to vibrate excitedly, indicating the possibility of romance in this pair’s future, although subsequent scenes move so slowly in that direction that the chemistry cools to something more professional. She’s almost like a daughter figure, sent to remind Prahastha of his connection to his home planet. Turns out, he’s been holding on to a bit of emotional baggage as well, and rather than urging its lonely hero to let go, “Cargo” nudges him toward reconnecting with the person he had feelings for 75 years earlier.\n\nPerhaps the film would be more effective for those who have some connection to its cultural roots. “Cargo” does a fair job of explaining its human-demon relations, although it seems like a rather elaborate tangent from the “Ad Astra”-esque notion that a character must travel incredibly far from home in order to work out a rather basic internal obstruction. What works here isn’t the story but the style: Kadav and production designer Mayur Sharma have conjured an endearingly analog sci-fi environment that’s fun to visit, and not only distinct from Western films but totally unlike anything else being done in India at the moment. She’s an original, and “Cargo” demonstrates clear promise for whatever her next life brings."

            "content": "Back in 2001, a middle-aged man made a video of his car and sent it around to a few friends. So far, so predictable—but this video featured a dilapidated Vauxhall Nova whizzing around a junk-strewn yard in a cloud of fog. At the wheel was Peter Dearman, a rumpled-looking autodidact who had spent the better part of four decades imagining a way to build engineering's ultimate vaporware: a motor powered only by air.\n\nBorn in 1951 on an egg farm north of London, Dearman would seem an unlikely candidate to have solved the problem. He left school at age 15 and worked in the family business for a while, then took a job at a local sheet-metal factory. He spent his evenings as many Englishmen do—out in the garage or the garden shed, tinkering. But Dearman's aptitude and ambition set him apart from other hobbyists. Over the years he filed patents for an improved adjustable wrench, a solar hot-water system, and a portable resuscitator that is still used in ambulances today. His most impressive achievement, however, was the Nova, whose engine he cobbled together from string, a used beer keg, a red plastic trash bin, and a coffee can's worth of liquid nitrogen.\n\nSee more from The Climate Issue | April 2020. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nThe idea behind Dearman's project dated back to at least 1899, when a Danish inventor named Hans Knudsen claimed to have designed an automobile that could run on “clear, bluish” fuel—liquefied air, to be sold at a penny a gallon. Rather than spewing out a toxic mix of pollutants and greenhouse gases, it would leave a harmless trail of condensation in its wake, wafting by at the stately speed of 12 mph. Knudsen received admiring media coverage at the time, but his company went belly-up in a matter of years. Modern cynics suspect he was engaged in a Theranos-style fraud, in part because no one could figure out how he'd done it. For years, a working liquid-air engine seemed about as fanciful as a perpetual motion machine.\n\nStill, the underlying principle was sound. Most engines rely on heat differentials. In the case of, say, a gasoline-powered car, the fuel is mixed with air, crammed into a piston chamber, and set alight, causing it to jump more than 1,000 degrees in temperature. The gas rapidly expands, propelling the piston and, in turn, the wheels. Take the same process, slide it way down the Fahrenheit scale, and you've got a liquid air engine. The nitrogen fuel starts out at 320 degrees below zero. When it enters the (much warmer) piston chamber, it boils off into gas. The change in temperature is smaller than with gasoline, so the pistons move with a little less oomph—but it's enough to get the wheels going. The real problem comes later: All that frigid fuel coursing through the engine quickly freezes it, effectively wiping out the heat differential. The air stops expanding, and the car runs out of puff.\n\nThe roadblock was clear, Dearman told me recently. He'd been pondering how to get around it since he was a teen. In a car that runs on heat, you need something to keep it cool—a radiator. In a car that runs on cold, you need the opposite. “I had an idea in my head for how to make it work, but I knew I wasn't going to get anywhere until I had some research to go on,” he said.\n\nThe breakthrough came in 1999. Dearman was watching an episode of the BBC's dearly departed flagship science program, Tomorrow's World, in which the presenter visited the University of Washington to report on a rather clunky-looking converted mail truck. It had trouble with hills, and its top speed was 22 mph, but it ran on liquid nitrogen (a profligate 5 gallons per mile). Invented by Abe Hertzberg, an eccentric professor who had previously come up with a laser-powered airplane, the truck boasted one major innovation. Before the freezing-cold fuel reached the engine, it ran through a heat exchanger, a series of concentric tubes that circulated outside air around the fuel line. John Williams, who worked on the truck as a graduate student, explained that the exchanger ensured “the whole thing didn't turn into a giant ball of ice.” But it didn't tackle the fundamental problem—that the liquid nitrogen still rapidly cooled the engine, throttling its own expansion into a gas. “Our project was a proof of concept,” Williams explained. “We were reconciled to a certain degree of terribleness.”\n\nMethane emissions burped out by cows could be cut by 99 percent if farmers changed 2 percent of the ruminants' diet to seaweed.\n\nFrom his sofa in the historic market town of Bishop's Stortford, Dearman immediately saw both the logic of Hertzberg's design and a way of improving on it. The answer to making sure the nitrogen continued expanding? Antifreeze. “It's obvious, but it's only obvious once you've seen it,” Dearman said. He went out into his garage, grabbed a blue plastic jug from the shelf, and started playing around with his lawn mower, hacking its engine to squirt a mixture of antifreeze and water into the piston chambers on each stroke. This brought ambient heat directly to the place it was needed most—and the engine's efficiency skyrocketed. The same trick worked on the battered Nova, bought as a guinea pig."

            "content": "Stratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nNearly a decade ago, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen founded Stratolaunch to build an aircraft capable of launching orbital rockets. At the time, the company's leadership included a host of luminous spaceflight officials, including former NASA chief Mike Griffin, who said the Stratolaunch aircraft “would make a very effective launcher.\"\n\nInitially, the company planned to launch rockets built by SpaceX. But over time, the company's plans changed to fly Pegasus rockets built by Orbital ATK. Eventually, Stratolaunch dropped this idea and announced that it was developing its own line of rockets.\n\nAlas, the aircraft never did prove to be an effective launcher. In fact, what became the world's largest airplane took flight just one time, in April, 2019. The Stratolaunch plane reached speeds above 300km/h and heights of 5km during its 150-minute test flight before landing safely at the Mojave Air and Space Port.\n\nBut the plane has been grounded since. And last summer, less than a year after Allen died in October, 2018, Stratolaunch effectively ceased operations. In recent months, however, the company has been rehiring employees, and this week it officially unveiled a new business plan—building and operating hypersonic test beds.\n\nTo facilitate this, the company released preliminary designs for \"Talon-A,\" a reusable vehicle capable of reaching Mach 6. (Hypersonic flight is generally defined as speeds above Mach 5 through the atmosphere.) The company says its 8.5-meter-long Talon-A vehicle is a \"flexible, high-speed testbed built for hypersonic research, experiments, and enabling operational missions.\" It is not clear when the Talon-A will be ready for flight.\n\nStratolaunch aims to provide customers with routine and repeatable access to the hypersonic environment for both \"proprietary and classified\" payloads. The company says that, because its 117-meter-wide aircraft is so large, it can accommodate three Talon vehicles at a time to support various operational scenarios.\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\nStratolaunch\n\n\"Our hypersonic testbeds will serve as a catalyst in sparking a renaissance in hypersonic technologies for our government, the commercial sector, and academia,\" said W. Jean Floyd, Stratolaunch's chief executive, in a statement.\n\nThis is an interesting, if not wholly unexpected, turn for Stratolaunch. During the last decade, the aerospace community has often collectively scratched its head, wondering how such a large aircraft could be cost-competitive in the hotly contested market to launch small- and medium-sized satellites. And without a dedicated rocket in existence, the company seemed little more than a vanity project for the wealthy Allen. If Stratolaunch served any purpose, the speculation went, it must be to meet some unspecified military need.\n\nThere can be no question that the military is interested in hypersonic technology. China, Russia, and the United States are all racing to develop hypersonic missiles, as well as new countermeasure technology as high-speed missiles threaten to penetrate most existing defenses. A Rand Corporation report from 2017 provides more basic information, suggesting, \"There is probably less than a decade available to substantially hinder the potential proliferation of hypersonic missiles and associated technologies.\"\n\nIf the company succeeds in developing the Talon-A vehicle—and we probably should have some healthy skepticism given that this is about the fifth or sixth vehicle proposed to fly on the Stratolaunch aircraft—it has a chance to help the military both test hypersonic missiles and potentially mitigate against them.\n\nListing image by Stratolaunch"

            "content": "The need to urgently transport medical supplies, as well as continue regular cargo movement, has seen unusual re-purposing of aircraft to haul freight. Cargo is still transported on dedicated commercial freight aircraft, which are flying more than ever, as well as on military aircraft. But there has been a supply shortage with the sudden stopping of commercial flights, which carry cargo below the passenger cabin. Here are seven unusual ways aircraft are now carrying cargo.\n\n1) Test aircraft. Airbus sent an A330-800 test aircraft from Toulouse to Tianjin in order to pick up approximately two million face masks and bring them back to France. Airbus said the majority would be donated to governments.\n\nMonitoring equipment is in the cabin, and boxes of masks were loaded around the work stations.\n\nA330neo Airbus Flight From Tianjin to Toulouse Airbus\n\nThis aircraft, MSN1888, was used in the flight test campaign that concluded in February with EASA and the FAA issuing a joint Type Certification. MSN1888 first flew in November 2018 and accumulated 370 test flight hours across 132 flights. It is the second member of the A330neo family after the A330-900, which is already in service.\n\nAirbus A330-800 used to ferry medical supplies from Tianjin to Toulouse Airbus\n\nAirbus has typically retained its prototype aircraft in order to have a platform to trial improvements or for marketing purposes. The A330neo flight test campaign comprised this A330-800 and two A330-900s.\n\nMSN1888’s relief flight to Tianjin was the A330neo’s first visit to China. It also gave the airport a glimpse of a possible future: Airbus may assemble the A330neo at its Tianjin plant, which already assembles A320s and performs delivery completion work for the original model of A330s.\n\n2) Military demonstrator. After the A330-800 returned from Toulouse, some of the masks it carried were loaded onto an A400M for onward transport to Getafe, near Madrid, where the masks were delivered to the Spanish Ministry of Defence, which will then put the masks into the Spanish health system. The A400M is a purpose-built military transport aircraft. Airbus retains some, including MSN56 used on this flight, for test and demonstration purposes.\n\nAirbus A400M transports masks to Spain in support of COVID-19 crisis efforts Airbus\n\n3) The Dreamlifter. Boeing is offering its Dreamlifter for relief missions but the aircraft have not yet performed any such flights. Ordinarily the Dreamlifter transports parts for the aircraft it is named after: the 787 Dreamliner. The four Dreamlifters are heavily modified 747s enlarged to carry the 787 wings and fuselage sections that typical freight aircraft cannot carry.\n\nAn employee stands in front of the Boeing Co. 747 Dreamlifter, used for transporting large pieces of ... [+] the new 787 Dreamliner, at the company's manufacturing plant in Everett, Washington, U.S., on Thursday, April 30, 2009. Boeing Co.'s delayed 787 Dreamliner has received the Federal Aviation Administration's approval for about 45 percent of the certification needed to deliver the plane as scheduled next year, the program's chief engineer said yesterday. The Dreamliner is currently about two years behind schedule. Photographer: Kevin P. Casey/Bloomberg News BLOOMBERG NEWS\n\nWhile the Dreamlifter has three times the volume of a normal 747 freighter, much of the gain is from a taller cargo compartment. It is unclear how extensively cargo could be stacked on pallets to utilize this height.\n\nThe Dreamlifter concept is similar to Airbus’ Beluga transporter (based on the A300) and its successor, the Beluga XL (based on the A330). Airbus is not known to have offered the Belugas for relief flights (it has other aircraft available) but Airbus is considering selling the Belugas as special freighters once it decommissions them.\n\n4) Refuelling tanker. Airbus has deployed another special A330: one undergoing conversion work to become a military version called the Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). Although commonly associated as an air-to-air refuelling tanker, it has additional capabilities from cargo transporter (as used in this flight) and medical evacuation aircraft (as France has done to move patients to less congested hospitals elsewhere in the country).\n\nAirbus’ own pilots flew the aircraft to Tianjin, the same Chinese city Airbus’ A330-800 test aircraft flew to. This relief mission picked up over four million face masks and then returned to Airbus’ plant at Getafe, near Madrid.\n\nAn A330MRTT being unloaded in Getafe (Spain) after returning from a trip to China to pick up mask ... [+] supplies. Airbus\n\n5) Planes with empty passenger seats. The first option airlines turned to was simply loading up the large cargo compartments on their big passenger aircraft and flying them without passengers. Long-haul aircraft like the 777-300ER essentially have a passenger cabin on top of a small freight aircraft. The 777 carries more cargo than the 747.\n\nCathay Pacific, Korean Air and Scoot were some of the first airlines to use passenger aircraft exclusively for cargo in this downturn. It is now a common option. Other airlines have joined, including American Airlines using a 777-300ER to transport only cargo between Dallas and Frankfurt, which it says are its first all-cargo flights since 1984 when it retired 747 freighters.\n\nUnited Airlines is flying 40 weekly cargo-only flights on passenger aircraft while Delta Air Lines will use A350s on three weekly cargo-only flights between Detroit and Shanghai. Virgin Atlantic is using 787s and A350s between London and New York.\n\nAmerican Airlines used a 777-300ER to carry only cargo between Dallas and Frankfurt American Airlines\n\n6) Cargo on seats. Airlines started maximizing cargo space by placing boxes on top of passenger seats (and in overhead bins). The seats were covered with a protective wrap before boxes were put on and secured. Austrian Airlines sent two 777-200s to Xiamen in China to pick up medical supplies. One of the first officers on the flight made a video during the loading process.\n\nAustrian Airlines 777-200 being loaded with cargo in the passenger cabin. Austrian Airlines\n\nAustrian does not normally fly to Xiamen, but other airlines are also mounting relief flights outside their normal scope. Aer Lingus has sent A330s from Dublin to Beijing, including four flights in one day. Aer Lingus does not normally fly to Beijing – or anywhere in Asia.\n\nOne of the smaller commercial jets, an Airbus A220 from Latvia’s Air Baltic, flew from Riga to China’s Urumqi to pick up medical supplies.\n\nPassenger repatriation flights are also generating unusual flight routes: Lufthansa landed in Auckland while Wizz Air, which ordinarily flies short-haul flights from Europe, mounted special repatriation flights to Canada and the U.S.\n\n7) Quasi-converted freighters. To gain even more space and flexibility to transport cargo on the main deck of passenger aircraft, airlines took out seats.\n\nGreece’s Aegean Airlines removed the seats from an A320 and A321. It expects to have at least 10 medical equipment relief flights to Asia. Aegean is paying for the aircraft, crew and other variable costs while Hellenic Petroleum’s EKO division will cover the fuel expense.\n\nAegean Airlines A321 Aegean Airlines\n\nChina Eastern removed approximately 160 seats from an A330-200, leaving 42 economy seats and all of the seats in business class (where the premium nature of the cabin adds complexity to seats, and in turn time for installation and removal).\n\nChinese airlines have been flying numerous relief flights, making it more viable to carry out this work. Aircraft seats are attached via special tracks, and there are supplementary cables, such as to power the in-seat video screen.\n\nAir New Zealand may also take out passenger seats on a 777-200, Chief Revenue Officer Cam Wallace wrote. Air New Zealand expects a sustained downturn but wants to preserve as much as possible of New Zealand’s export economy including meat, seafood and produce. Next week Air New Zealand will have 14 cargo-only flights to Shanghai.\n\nRemoving seats gives more space but does not make these aircraft true converted freighters. Airlines are not installing cargo hatches, so cargo will have to be loaded through passenger doors, which are too narrow for the cargo containers and pallets used below deck. The lower holds have built-in systems to manoeuvre and secure containers and pallets.\n\nConverted freighters typically have their man deck floor strengthened to accommodate the higher weight of cargo compared to passengers and seats. Converted freighters also remove overhead bins and other passenger furnishings in order to maximise available space and weight.\n\nFull conversion work takes weeks or months depending on aircraft size and is not readily reversible. So these interim measures to increase cargo capacity suffice while demand remains high and supply low.\n\nMost governments recognize the value and necessity of cargo. Cargo-only flights will not apply to China’s new restrictions limiting the number of foreign airlines. But India, which is temporarily banning passenger flights, is not allowing passenger aircraft to be used only to carry cargo."
