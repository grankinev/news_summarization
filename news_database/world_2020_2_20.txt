            "content": "Hong Kong (CNN) Weeks into the novel coronavirus crisis , the outbreak finally appears to be stabilizing in central China, where the virus was initially detected before it spread throughout the country and the world.\n\nSmall outbreaks continue to fast expand elsewhere, however, not least of which on board the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, where two deaths were confirmed Thursday, the first from the hundreds of cases on the ship, which has begun disembarking passengers after a 14-day quarantine this week.\n\nThe global death toll now stands at 2,128, after an additional 108 deaths were reported in Hubei province as of Thursday morning. All but 10 deaths have occurred in mainland China.\n\nAn additional 349 cases were confirmed in Hubei, more than 1,300 fewer than reported the day before. Outside of the provincial capital Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, the daily count of patients who have been treated and discharged has exceeded the number of newly confirmed cases for four consecutive days now, according to state news agency Xinhua\n\nThere is some uncertainty of how cases are being diagnosed in Hubei, with the criteria for diagnosing the virus outside of the lab shifting in recent weeks. Chinese authorities this week switched back to reporting only laboratory confirmed cases from Hubei, after last week allowing clinical diagnoses by doctors -- based on symptoms or more immediate tests -- to be counted towards the province's totals.\n\nMore than 10,330 patients have been discharged across Hubei so far, though some 43,000 remain in hospital, 2,050 of whom are in a critical condition, the provincial health authority said.\n\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) previously estimated that the virus peaked in late January, according to data from lab tests. However, the number of clinically diagnosed cases -- patients with symptoms who could not be tested or were believed to have falsely tested negative -- continued to rise well into February.\n\nWhile the data from the epicenter of the outbreak appears to be positive, the crisis may not be over yet, either inside China or worldwide. Experts have warned there could be a renewed increase in cases once China properly returns to work late this week or next -- hundreds of millions of people around the country have been on lockdown for weeks now.\n\nThe number of cases is also continuing to grow alarmingly in several places outside of the mainland, though still far short of the figures seen in China. On Thursday, South Korea recorded an additional 31 confirmed cases, bringing the country's total to 82. That came after an increase of 20 on Wednesday, previously the largest single-day jump in Korea.\n\nIn Singapore the infection rate continues to climb, with 84 confirmed cases. Similarly, in Hong Kong, there are 63 confirmed cases, and two deaths.\n\nIn Japan, where global attention has been focused on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, the worst outbreak outside of mainland China, there have been 68 cases confirmed with no connection to the ship, raising concerns of a self-sustaining outbreak in the country.\n\nPhotos: The novel coronavirus outbreak A sales clerk wears a mask as she waits for customers at a hat shop in Beijing on Tuesday, February 18.

Hide Caption 69 of 69\n\nCruise ship disembarks\n\nMore passengers from the Diamond Princess disembarked Thursday morning , though serious questions remain over the effectiveness of the two-week quarantine imposed on the ship since it first docked at the Japanese port of Yokohama.\n\nWhen the first load of passengers left the ship over the weekend, on a pair of flights to the US, more than a dozen of the 300 or so on board were found to be showing symptoms of the virus . All of those who had boarded the planes were supposedly coronavirus free, according to Japanese authorities.\n\nThe Japanese quarantine officially ended Wednesday, and the first group of passengers began disembarking. Hundreds of cases have been confirmed on board, however, and on Thursday authorities in Japan confirmed the first two deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nJan Swartz, President and CEO of the vessel's operator Princess Cruises, who had flown to Japan to greet the passengers as they left the ship, said that those on board united to help each through an \"unprecedented situation.\"\n\n\"I think the guests and our crew who came together to help support each other, from 57 different countries and regions around the world, really lifted each other's hearts,\" Swartz said.\n\nMultiple countries have arranged flights to bring their citizens home once they disembark -- so long as they do not test positive for the virus. Canada has chartered a plane from Tokyo's Haneda airport Friday. The 47 Canadians who had been found to have the virus would receive medical care in Japan, the government said in a statement.\n\nThe early evacuation of Americans from the ship was seen as something of an implicit criticism of the Japanese quarantine, with the Centers for Disease Control saying that remaining on the ship was an ongoing risk to US citizens.\n\nSpeaking to CNN this week, Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist at Kobe University who visited the ship, said he was highly concerned about the effectiveness of the quarantine and the precautions taken on board.\n\n\"I was so scared because there was no way to tell where the virus is and everybody was not careful about it,\" Iwata said. \"There was no single infection control person inside the ship -- the bureaucrats were in charge of everything.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED See what Shanghai, China, looks like as coronavirus fears linger Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See what Shanghai, China, looks like as coronavirus fears linger 02:26\n\nEconomic woes\n\nJapan is likely facing a recession as the coronavirus compounds existing problems with the country's economy. In China, while the worst of the virus is hopefully past, the economic cost has yet to be fully realized, and there are fears it could continue to grow and have knock-on ramifications for the global economy.\n\nChina's central bank promised more support Wednesday for companies, including lowering lending rates, increased credit support and providing medium and long-term loans. The People's Bank of China said the epidemic \"has had some impact on the Chinese economy, but the shock will be short-lived and will not change the country's sound economic fundamentals.\"\n\nOther outlooks are not so rosy . Around a third of 1,000 small and medium-sized companies surveyed by academics from Tsinghua University and Peking University last week said they could only survive for a month with the cash they have.\n\nSmaller companies account for around 60% of China's GDP, and employ a massive 80% of all workers, according to government statistics published last September.\n\n\"The coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the camel's back,\" wrote Zhao Jian, director of the Shandong province-based Atlantis Research Institute in a research note earlier this month.\n\nHe warned that if the outbreak doesn't end soon, unemployment will likely rise as businesses shut down -- a problem Beijing had been fighting hard this year to prevent. Job losses could spur a tide of housing foreclosures, Zhao added, compounding the country's economic woes.\n\nEven as the country starts to get back to work, problems remain for smaller firms. According to the state-backed Global Times , Chinese factories and businesses trying to resume operations this week have been \"faced with tremendous risks and challenges, from lengthy applications to tough restrictions and shortages in cash, labor and supplies.\"\n\nCompanies have reported having to submit up to 21 separate documents, including a 15-page application form, emergency plans and various other letters of commitment, to local officials. A screenshot of an application from a company in Sichuan province went viral on social media this week -- a single application to resume operation require a total of nine stamps from various county and provincial officials.\n\n\"These are the unintended consequences of the battle against the epidemic: the restrictive measures put in place to stop the virus have also restricted companies from resuming production,\" Tian Yun, director of the China Society of Macroeconomics Research Center, told the Global Times. \"In some places, officials have taken the battle to a whole new, unnecessary level.\""

REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi\n\nThe outbreak has also significantly increased the chance Beijing doesn’t comply with all of the terms of a Jan. 15 initial trade agreement signed with Washington, potentially reigniting a damaging trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nStill, medians from the Feb. 10-19 Reuters poll of over 100 economic forecasters found the overall U.S. economic growth outlook for this year unchanged compared with last month.\n\nThe forecast for growth in the current quarter was reduced just 0.1 percentage point to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.5% - already slow, even by recent standards. The economy was then expected to grow 1.8-2.0% each quarter until end-2021.\n\n“At this point, we are assuming the coronavirus impact will be relatively small, and more importantly, temporary. So whatever drag there is in the first quarter will largely be reversed in the second,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities.\n\n“It will not have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. But that is certainly a risk for sure. I mean, that is the source to downside risk if it keeps escalating.”\n\nGrowth is expected to pick up to 1.8% in the second quarter of this year, only slightly slower than the 1.9% forecast in the January poll.\n\nIn that survey, which was conducted before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global public health emergency, 56% of economists said the risks to their U.S. growth views were more to the upside.\n\nHowever, as the outbreak spread, that has switched around to nearly 70%, or 33 of 48 respondents now saying the opposite. Around 75,000 people have been reported as carriers of the virus globally, with over 2,000 confirmed dead.\n\nDespite these risks, the likelihood of a U.S. recession in the coming year only edged up to a median 23% from 20% in January.\n\n“The threat the coronavirus outbreak poses in an environment of already subdued global growth underlines the potential for medium-term U.S. economic weakness,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\n\n“It is impossible to forecast the path of the virus, but it increases the chances the Federal Reserve will cut rates at least once more to provide some support to the economy.”\n\nWhile the consensus showed the Fed would keep rates unchanged at 1.50%-1.75% at least until the end of next year, Reuters analysis showed nearly 40% of economists polled now expect at least one rate cut at some point this year.\n\n“We think the Fed will keep rates on hold, but we agree with the market that there are asymmetric risks to policy where easing is more likely than tightening,” said Michelle Meyer, U.S. economist at BofA Global Research.\n\n“With underlying economic data remaining robust, core inflation trending higher and policy already accommodative, there is a higher hurdle to cut this year than last.”\n\nThe poll found that inflation as measured by the core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred gauge, would range between 1.8% and 1.9% until the second quarter of next year and touch the central bank’s 2% target in the second half of 2021.\n\nWhen asked if the chance of non-compliance by Beijing with the terms of the initial trade agreement had increased significantly since the coronavirus outbreak, nearly two-thirds of economists, 30 of 48, said yes.\n\nThat stands in contrast to results from a separate poll last week on the hit to China’s economy, in which about 56% of economists said the chance of non-compliance had not increased.\n\n“If domestic activity in China remains severely negatively affected by the outbreak of the virus, in our eyes, it’s highly likely the Chinese would try to reduce the purchases of U.S. goods they have promised,” said Bernd Weidensteiner at Commerzbank.\n\n“There is actually a paragraph in the Phase 1 agreement that in case of natural disasters...there is a way to purchase less than the promised amount, and they have a reason now that they cannot fully live up to their commitments, which are relatively generous,” he added."

Markets in Australia and New Zealand minted record highs.\n\n“The lowering of interest rates, cutting of corporate tax rates, increasing money supply...these are all seen as very strong responses” from China, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\nThe prospect of central bank support and easier money also underpinned bonds, with U.S. Treasury yields steady, with benchmark 10-year yields last at 1.5815%.\n\nOvernight pan-regional STOXX 600 index in Europe rose 0.8% to a record high. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all gained.\n\nMore than 2,100 people have died from the coronavirus in China, spreading to more than two dozen countries, and governments around the world are trying to prevent it from becoming a global pandemic.\n\nYEN TUMBLES\n\nThe most dramatic move overnight was a steep drop in the Japanese yen, which posted its sharpest fall against the dollar in half a year, even as safe-haven assets such as gold traded firmer.\n\nSelling was broad and sustained through the session.\n\nThe yen fell nearly 1.4% against the dollar and the kiwi and almost 2% against the Norwegian krone - its sharpest daily drop against the krone in almost three years.\n\n“It is rare to see USD/JPY and gold ripping at the same time, but the simple explanation is that the world is awash in a flood of money and there are not many attractive places to park that excess liquidity,” said Brent Donnelly, Spot FX Trader at HSBC.\n\nThe yen recouped some of those losses in morning trade, to rise 0.2% to 111.17 per dollar.\n\nElsewhere oil prices held overnight gains, while gold gave some of its rise back.\n\nU.S. crude last sat 30 cents firmer at $53.60 per barrel and Brent settled at $59.12. Gold last traded at $1,609.33 per ounce."

            "content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A day after Jeanhee Kim learned of a coronavirus case in her Singapore apartment block, she was visited by a distinguished-looking man she later learned was a senior government minister.\n\nA man wearing a mask in precaution of the coronavirus looks on along the Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade in Singapore February 19, 2020. REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nKim, a 51-year old American who had just relocated to the island as the outbreak began, said the man had asked her how her family were feeling, gave her some surgical masks and reassured her that Singapore was on top of the situation.\n\nHer experience exemplifies the fastidious approach taken to combat the outbreak in the city-state - which has included using police investigators and security cameras to help track and quarantine more than 2,500 people, and won international praise.\n\n“Singapore is leaving no stone unturned,” World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week.\n\nBut experts say Singapore’s virus-fighting playbook cannot be easily copied in other countries that lack its geographic attributes, financial clout and wide-ranging state controls.\n\n“If Singapore can’t contain it, I don’t see any country that can,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota.\n\nINTRUSIVE\n\nThe densely packed island of 5.7 million has 84 coronavirus cases, the highest number outside mainland China, if the hundreds of infections on a cruise ship docked near Tokyo are excluded from Japan’s count.\n\nBut experts say Singapore’s high tally says more about its ability to detect the disease.\n\nA recent study by Harvard University’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics estimates Singapore is picking up three times more cases than other countries due to its disease surveillance and contact-tracing capacity.\n\nSize also matters - Singapore has less than a tenth the land area of the Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus first surfaced late last year and around half its population, making containment easier.\n\nAs a sovereign state that has been ruled by the same party since independence in 1965, it also maintains tight control over the movement of people into and out of the city and has strict laws to keep potential virus-spreaders in line.\n\nWhen the first cases of infected Chinese visitors to Singapore surfaced in late January, a 140-strong team of government contact tracers set to work interviewing patients and identifying and quarantining those close to them.\n\nA close contact is defined as anyone who has been within two metres and spent 30 minutes with an infected patient.\n\nFinding these contacts has involved asking airlines to hand over flight manifests, tracking patients’ movements on security cameras and roping in police investigators for the search, health ministry officials said.\n\nTo date, Singapore has quarantined nearly 2,593 people.\n\n“There is an acceptance of that intrusiveness in Singapore,” said Chong Ja Ian, political science professor at the National University of Singapore. “The public response to these sort of demands tends to be quite ready, so that helps with the ability to trace.”\n\nIt is an offence for individuals to withhold or provide inaccurate information to a contact tracing officer. Moreover, people who breach quarantine orders can be fined up to S$10,000 ($7,137.76), jailed for up to six months, or both.\n\nAuthorities have also enforced 14-day confinement of workers who have recently traveled to China, with more than 1,000 calls and visits made a day to ensure compliance. Breaches have seen work passes revoked and employers lose their rights to hire foreigners.\n\nIn other measures, nearly 400,000 people have signed up to a government WhatsApp service that sends daily virus-related alerts on case numbers, disease prevention and warnings about internet rumors.\n\nDEEP POCKETS\n\nSingapore’s decisive response draws to some extent from its experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003-2004, which led to over 30 fatalities on the island, one of the highest counts outside mainland China.\n\nThe country was one of the first to ban Chinese travelers earlier this month, a move that came at significant economic cost to the global transit hub, which counts China as its largest trade partner and biggest source of tourists.\n\nThe prime minister has already warned the outbreak could tip its fragile economy into recession.\n\nBut Singapore has deep pockets.\n\nIt is the wealthiest country in Asia and among the top 10 globally, in nominal GDP per capita terms, and on Tuesday unveiled a $4.5 billion package in its annual budget to fight the virus and manage its economic fallout.\n\nThere have been some missteps in Singapore’s response. The government has said there was some “misunderstanding” when it raised its virus alert level two weeks ago, sparking panic buying of essentials like rice, noodles and toilet paper.\n\nIts methods may also not be sustainable, especially if the epidemic worsens.\n\n“We can’t keep doing what we are doing forever. We can’t keep all elective surgery canceled, we can’t stop everyone going on holidays,” said Dale Fisher, an infectious diseases expert in Singapore who chairs the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the World Health Organization.\n\n“Eventually this will have to be undone a little bit,” said Fisher.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nBut for Kim, who regularly gets emails from family overseas urging her to stay safe, Singapore’s response has brought comfort.\n\n“There is definitely concern among our loved ones,” she said. “But I’ve been just reassuring them that the response has been very good and the new practices and policies in place seem to be very sound.”\n\n($1 = 1.4010 Singapore dollars)"

An improvement in jobs, a record number of people at work and unemployment back down to Celtic Tiger levels, currently running just under 5%, having peaked at 16% after the crisis.\"\n\nBut despite the \"dramatic turnaround\", he told BBC World Service the improvement had brought challenges in areas like health and housing.\n\nHomeless families\n\nAlmost 10,000 people were registered homeless in December, many of them families living in hotels paid for by the state.\n\n\"That is the new phenomenon, that's only happened in the last seven or eight years, before that there was no such thing as homeless families,\" Father Peter McVerry explains.\n\nThe Catholic priest has helped homeless people for decades, with a foundation in Dublin that offers desperate people a place to stay,\n\nImage copyright McVerry Foundation Image caption Father Peter McVerry, a campaigner for homeless people in Ireland, fears thousands of families cannot afford high rents.\n\n\"The majority of homeless people are being evicted from the private rented sector, for either of two reasons. The rent has shot to a level they cannot afford or the landlord is selling the house and says you have to get out.\"\n\nFather McVerry bluntly told the BBC's World Business Report, \"there are landlords who are in serious financial difficulties, about 12,000 with mortgages at least two years in arrears, but there are a lot of very greedy landlords.\n\n\"Some children are living in hotels for two years or more, it's seriously damaging.\"\n\nReminiscent of the Celtic Tiger economy years, there is a boom in construction and cranes are once again a common sight in Dublin.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cranes on the skyline of Dublin are a familiar site as the Irish economy powers ahead.\n\nBut can Ireland build 100,000 new affordable homes within five years as promised by Sinn Fein?\n\n\"In 2019 we reached 21,800 units.

There is also a shortage of skilled labour.\n\n\"In the next five years we could need anything from 80,000 to 100,000 additional workforce to keep up with the demand,\" he says.\n\nBrexit fears\n\nDespite its strong growth, the economy also faces risks.\n\nThe UK's exit from the European Union is one threat, as recognised by Martin McElhinney, general manager of McElhinneys department store in Ballybofey, County Donegal, close to the Northern Ireland border.\n\nImage copyright McElhinneys Image caption McElhinneys has been one of Ireland's retail successes\n\n\"Thirty per cent of my customers come from Northern Ireland, over 30% of my employees live in Northern Ireland.

This and other perks have benefited home-grown firms, too.\n\nGillian Doyle, boss of Cerebreon Technologies, in Ardara in the north west, says a sudden change in the rules would \"definitely curb growth\".\n\n\"The next government needs to be very careful,\" she says.\n\nImage caption Gillian Doyle, with partner Kenneth Doherty, founded Cerebreon Technologies\n\nThe Irish people used the ballot box to send politicians a loud message, that their economic strategy has not benefited everybody.

            "content": "Populism, political risk and the economy: What we can learn from the Italian experience\n\nPierluigi Balduzzi, Emanuele Brancati, Marco Brianti, Fabio Schiantarelli\n\nThe effects of political uncertainty can be captured in the spread of sovereign credit default swaps. This column shows how the rise of populist movements in Italy following the Global Crisis and sovereign debt crisis can be traced within the country’s contract price levels, and also highlights the impacts on the real economy. Italy has been an ideal laboratory to explore and learn about the economic consequences of political risk shocks, and the instability there means this is likely to continue to be the case in the future.\n\nIn the years that followed the global and sovereign debt crises, Italy has experienced a rise of populist forces (Lega and Movimento 5 Stelle) that culminated in June 2018 in the formation of a populist government, which lasted approximately one year. These political developments affected the concerns and risk associated with budgetary policies, debt sustainability, and the very prospects of continued membership of the euro.\n\nWhat have been the effects of political risk shocks during the period 2013 to 2019 on Italy’s domestic financial markets and real economy? Are there any spillover effects to financial markets of other euro area countries? These questions are of primary importance in light of the rise of populist forces in other countries, albeit with their own specificities, that are profoundly altering the political landscape.1\n\nNot surprisingly, all these international developments have generated an increase in economic policy uncertainty, and a series of papers provide empirical evidence on its adverse effects on the financial markets and the real economy. For instance, Baker et al. (2016) analyse the effects of economic policy uncertainty on the US economy. Kelly et al. (2016) focus instead on the effect of political uncertainty around election and international summits on stock option contracts. Caldara et al. (2019) and Baker et al. (2019a) discuss the consequences of trade uncertainty for US firms and for the US stock market, respectively. Finally, Bloom et al. (2019) analyse the implications of Brexit for UK firms.2\n\nOne element that is interesting and distinctive about the Italian case is that the rise in populism occurred in the context of a high level of government debt (around 130% of GDP) and decades of slow growth. These factors contributed to concerns about debt sustainability. Thus, the Italian experience is very relevant for countries in similar circumstances. However, Italy’s economic importance (it is the third largest euro area country and the eight largest in the world in terms of GDP) makes the Italian case of general significance, as domestic political risk shocks have the potential to generate direct and indirect spillover effects to other euro area countries.\n\nA quick look at the evolution of the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the 2014 clause dollar-denominated contracts from September 2014 onward suggests that many of the significant fluctuations occur as a result of important domestic political developments.3 These can be seen in Figure 1, where we report Italy’s sovereign CDS spreads together with those of other euro area countries. In particular, the CDS spread displays a pronounced spike between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of 2018, reaching values above 250 basis points – an upward jump of around 150 basis points. In addition, we observe smaller increases at the same time in the sovereign CDS spreads of other euro area countries. This upward movement coincides with a series of events which saw the two major populist parties in Italy – Lega and Movimento 5 Stelle – creating first a coalition and eventually a government. Note also that the sovereign CDS spread for Italy has been much higher, particularly since 2018, compared not only to the spreads for Germany and France, but also to Ireland, Spain and Portugal.\n\nFigure 1 Sovereign CDS spread, 2014 clause contracts, for selected euro area countries\n\nNote: The figure reports the spread on the dollar-denominated 2014 clause 5-year sovereign CDS contracts for France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.\n\nIn a new paper (Balduzzi et al. 2020), we build on these observations and assume that the daily change in the Italian sovereign CDS spread on the dates of political events (e.g. elections and the formation of a government) and policy announcements (e.g. the submission of the draft budget to the European Commission and the subsequent correspondence) is informative about the unobserved shocks to concerns associated with budgetary policies, government debt sustainability, and membership of the euro in Italy.4 This is a plausible hypothesis, as the sovereign CDS spread reflects the probability of the government defaulting on its debt and the expected losses for bond holders in that case. We apply the methodology discussed in Stock and Watson (2018) and use the daily change in the CDS spread for Italian government bonds on political and policy announcement dates as an instrument for political risk shocks in the context of local projections (Jorda 2005). The choice of a high-frequency change in the CDS, together with the use of controls for international risk, is made in order to plausibly satisfy the exogeneity assumptions required by the local projection–instrumental variables (LP-IV) procedure.5\n\nThe change in the CDS spreads on our selected dates (see Figure 2) highlights the importance of the rise to power of populist forces and of their policy announcements in generating an increase in political risk. At the same time, it also emphasises the relevance of institutional constraints such as the European Commission and the Italian presidency placing limits on budgetary policies perceived as risky and on a repositioning of Italy with respect to the European fiscal rules and membership of the common currency. These constraints triggered risk-decreasing shocks that cushioned the increase in all the spreads and the negative effects on the stock market stemming from the rise and ascendance to power of the populist forces.6\n\nFigure 2 ∆Sovereign CDS spread, 2014 clause contracts, around political events\n\nNote: Changes in the CDS spread of the sovereign 2014-clause contract denominated in dollars around selected dates. Changes are defined as the closing price of the event day minus the closing price of the previous day. EC stands for European Commission.\n\nWe use the local LP-IV approach, with the instrument obtained using the high-frequency identification strategy described above, to analyse the effect of political risk shocks on financial markets using data at a daily and monthly frequency. Our evidence from the response of each endogenous variable, at different horizons, to a single shock indicates that increases in political risk associated with the rise to power of populist forces have a powerful effect on both domestic and international financial variables. Italian sovereign and bank CDS spreads, as well as the Italian BTP-German Bund yield spreads, increase, making government and bank borrowing more expensive. For a sense of the size of the quantitative impact, note that a unit change in our instrument leads to a sustained change of the BTP-Bund spread that is twice as large.7 Political risk shocks also negatively affect Italian stock market returns, although the effect is not as pronounced as for the spreads.\n\nWe also provide evidence that political risk shocks affect the difference between the spread for the 2014 and the 2003 clause Italian CDS contracts denominated in the same currency (defined as the ISDA basis), which captures the probability of redenomination and depreciation of the new currency in that case. Our shocks also affect the quanto spread, defined here as the difference between the spreads on the dollar-denominated and euro-denominated Italian sovereign CDS contracts, which reflects the probability of sovereign default and the associated expected depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar. Note that the 2014 and 2003 contracts begin to diverge at the beginning of 2017, but the gap opens up dramatically in June 2018, with the former displaying much larger increases, reaching 286 basis points in mid-November 2018, while the latter increased only to 177 basis points.8\n\nImportantly, the sovereign CDS spreads for Spain and Portugal display significant and sizable responses to Italian political risk shocks. There is also an effect on France and Germany, but this is smaller and less significant. Similarly, in terms of the spread of government bond yields relative to the German Bund, the quantitative effects are larger for Spain and Portugal, followed by Ireland and France.\n\nFinally, we show that these shocks have had adverse effects on the real economy and present some evidence supporting this conclusion based on the monthly Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and other leading indicators of real activity from the beginning of 2013 until July 2019. The negative effects, although significant, were not as large as one might have feared. This is, most likely, because the political shocks we have analysed occurred in the context of a large degree of monetary accommodation and the provision of ample liquidity by the ECB. This has contributed to preventing Italian spreads from reaching the levels observed during the sovereign debt crisis in 2011-2012. In addition, the strengthening of banks' balance sheets following a period of positive growth from 2015 to the middle of 2017, the recapitalisation exercises prompted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) stress tests, and the reduction in the share of non-performing loans has allowed banks to deal with the increase in the spread in government and bank bonds without significantly increasing lending rates. As a result, the bank cost of funding channel was not important during this period, while it was key during the global and sovereign debt crises, as shown in Balduzzi et al. (2018a). In sum, all the factors we have mentioned have lessened, but not eliminated, the negative impact of the rise of populism on the real economy in Italy.\n\nAlthough Lega is now out of the government that has been formed by the more conventional centre-left parties in coalition with Movimento 5 Stelle, Italy continues to be characterised by political instability. There are legitimate questions about the ability of the government to survive as well as concerns about the outcome of an election, if it were to be called, in light of the continued strength in the polls of the Lega party. In addition, there are doubts about the possibility of a political equilibrium in Italy in support of reforms that could set the country on a more favourable growth path, which would help with debt sustainability. All this is reflected in the level of the sovereign CDS spread that, although smaller than in the second half of 2018, it is still around 140 basis points – higher than that of all other euro area countries (except Greece). Italy has been an ideal laboratory to explore and learn about the economic consequences of political risk shocks, and this is likely to continue to be the case in the future.\n\nReferences\n\nAlfaro, I, N Bloom, and X Lin (2018), “The finance uncertainty multiplier”, NBER working paper 24571.\n\nAzzimonti, M (2018), “Partisan conflict and private investment”, Journal of Monetary Economics 93: 114–131.\n\nBalduzzi, P, E Brancati, and F Schiantarelli (2018a), “Financial markets, banks’ cost of funding, and firms’ decisions: lessons from two crises”, Journal of Financial Intermediation 36: 1-15.\n\nBalduzzi, P, E Brancati, and F Schiantarelli (2018b), “Crowding out risk: Sovereign debt, banks, and firms’ investment in Italy”, VoxEU.org, 9 November.\n\nBalduzzi, P, E Brancati, M Brianti, and F Schiantarelli (2020), “Populism, political risk and the economy: Lessons from Italy”, IZA Discussion Paper 12929,and Boston College Working Paper 989.\n\nBaker, S R, N Bloom, and S J Davis (2016), “Measuring economic policy uncertainty”, Quarterly Journal of Economics 131(4): 1593–1636.\n\nBaker, S, N Bloom, and S J Davis (2019a), “The extraordinary rise in trade policy uncertainty”, VoxEU.org, 17 September.\n\nBaker, S, N Bloom, S J Davis and K Kost (2019b), “Policy News and Stock Market Volatility”, NBER working paper 25720.\n\nBasu, S and B Bundick (2017), “Uncertainty shocks in a model of effective demand”, Econometrica 85(3): 937–958.\n\nBloom, N (2009), “The impact of uncertainty shocks”, Econometrica 77(3): 623–685.\n\nBloom, N, M Floetotto, N Jaimovich, I Saporta-Eksten, and S J Terry (2018), “Really uncertain business cycles”, Econometrica 86(3): 1031–1065.\n\nBloom, N (2014), “Fluctuations in uncertainty”, Journal of Economic Perspectives 28(2): 153–76.\n\nBloom N, P Bunn, S Chen, P Mizen, P Smietanka, G Thwaites (2019), “The impact of Brexit on UK firms”, VoxEU.org, 4 September.\n\nCaldara, D, M Iacoviello, P Molligo, A Prestipino, and A Raffo (2019), “The economic effects of trade policy uncertainty”, Journal of Monetary Economics, forthcoming.\n\nCherubini, U (2019), “The econometrics of redenomination risk”, mimeo, University of Bologna.\n\nDe Santis, R A (2019), “Redenomination risk”, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 51: 2173-2206.\n\nFernàndez-Villaverde, J, P Guerròn-Quintana, K Kuester, and J Rubio-Ramìrez (2015), “Fiscal volatility shocks and economic activity”, American Economic Review 105(11): 3352–84.\n\nFieldhouse, A J, K Mertens, and M O Ravn (2018), “The macroeconomic effects of government asset purchases: Evidence from postwar us housing credit policy”, Quarterly Journal of Economics 133(3): 1503–1560.\n\nGertler, M and P Karadi (2015), “Monetary policy surprises, credit costs, and economic activity”, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 7(1): 44–76.\n\nGros, D (2018), “Italian risk spread: Fiscal versus redenomination risk”, VoxEU.org, 29 August.\n\nJordà, O (2005), “Estimation and inference of impulse responses by local projections”, American Economic Review 95(1): 161–182.\n\nKelly, B, L Pàstor, and P Veronesi (2016), “The price of political uncertainty: Theory and evidence from the option market”, Journal of Finance 71(5): 2417–2480.\n\nKremens, L (2019), “Currency redenomination risk”, mimeo, University of Washington.\n\nLeduc, S and Z Liu (2016), “Uncertainty shocks are aggregate demand shocks”, Journal of Monetary Economics 82: 20–35.\n\nMertens, K and M O Ravn (2013), “The dynamic effects of personal and corporate income tax changes in the United States”, American Economic Review 103(4): 1212–47.\n\nMinenna, M (2017), “CDS markets signal rising fear of euro breakup”, Financial Times, 6 March.\n\nPàstor, L and P Veronesi (2012), “Uncertainty about government policy and stock prices”, Journal of Finance 67(4): 1219–1264.\n\nPàstor, L and P Veronesi (2013), “Political uncertainty and risk premia”, Journal of Financial Economics 110(3): 520–545.\n\nRamey, V A and M D Shapiro (1998), “Costly capital reallocation and the effects of government spending”, in Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, Volume 48, Elsevier, pp. 145–194.\n\nStock, J H and M W Watson (2012), “Disentangling the channels of the 2007-2009 recession”, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 81–135.\n\nStock, J H and M W Watson (2018), “Identification and estimation of dynamic causal effects in macroeconomics using external instruments”, Economic Journal 128(610): 917–948.\n\nVisco, I.

We report the figures for the dollar denominated contract as it has the more liquid market.\n\n4 More precisely, we focus on those dates on which general elections for the Italian and European parliament took place, as well as the dates when the President of the Italian Republic chooses a political leader to attempt forming a government (Incarico). They also include the dates in which the budget law is introduced and later revised to be sent to the European Commission for approval, as well as replies of the Commission. Finally, we consider changes around the time of a few significant announcements, such as the formation of a novel coalition between the populist parties (Movimento 5 Stelle and Lega) after the last general elections (Il Contratto), and the recent withdrawal of one of the two parties (Lega) from the government.\n\n5 The use of external instruments in local projections is also found in Fieldhouse et al. (2018). See also Stock and Watson (2012), Mertens and Ravn (2013), Gertler and Karadi (2015), and Ramey and Shapiro (1998) for estimation of structural VARs using external instruments. The econometric methodology is described in details in Balduzzi et al. (2020). In essence, the variable being instrumented (indicator variable) is, in our case, the change in the sovereign CDS itself at all dates, under the normalizing assumption that a change of one unit in political risk is associated with a unit change in the CDS spread. The instruments must satisfy two key exogeneity assumptions to be valid. The first one (contemporaneous exogeneity) requires that changes in sovereign CDS spread on the selected dates are orthogonal to the other structural shocks in the system occurring at the same time. This must hold conditionally on a set of controls that include in our case past values of Italian financial market variables, as well as the contemporaneous and past values of the log-change in the VIX and of the first principal component of the change in the CDS spread for euro countries (with the exception of Greece and Italy) plus the UK. The choice of a narrow window of a day and of a limited number of dates is meant to maximize the probability that this is the case. The second assumption (lead-lag exogeneity) requires our instrument to be also uncorrelated with leads and lags of all the shocks in the system. We address this issue by including as a control lagged values of the dependent variable and of the instrument itself. We also we conduct a standard placebo test where we define our instrument as the change in the CDS spread on a randomly chosen set of dates. The results are supportive of our approach. Finally we implement a large set of robustness checks, including some in which we reduce the number of dates, eliminating those around which other international shocks may have occurred.\n\n6 Specifically, there are drastic increases in the spread in correspondence of the announcement of the contract between the Movimento 5 Stelle and Lega parties to govern together in May, which outlined the intention of pursuing a very expansionary fiscal policy based on an increase in welfare payments (‘Reddito di Cittadinanza’) and a lowering of the retirement age (‘Quota 100’). Those concerns were enhanced by the intention of the incoming populist government to propose Paolo Savona, an economist that has expressed opposition to Italian membership of the euro, to the position of Minister of Economy and Finance (the main economic post in the Italian government). The increase in the spread that followed, was in part reversed by the opposition of the President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella, who imposed the choice of a more moderate Minister of Economy, Giovanni Tria. Another upward movement in the spread followed the drafting of the budget law at the end of 2018 that contemplated a budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP, and its subsequent rejection by the European Commission. It also eventually triggered a procedure for excessive debt. The achievement of a compromise with a lower deficit and the end of the excessive debt procedure brought some respite. However, the cumulated effect over the period captures the market's increasing overall concerns about budgetary sustainability and Italy's position concerning fiscal rules and the Euro.\n\n7 A simple back-of-the-envelope way to think about the quantitative effects is to observe that the 5-years BTP-Bund spread fluctuated around an average value of 216 basis points during the populist government, which represents a 120 basis points increase relative the average from September 2014 to the day of the Contract between Lega and Movimento 5 Stelle. If we cumulate the changes in the sovereign CDS spread around political and policy dates over this period, we obtain a value of around 35 basis points. This cumulated change in our instrument can ‘account’ for a large fraction of the observed BTP-Bund spread change (approximately 70 basis points out of the 120 basis points change between the two periods), using an impulse response of around two. For a more formal assessment based on the forecast error variance decomposition, see Balduzzi et al. (2020).\n\n8 The behaviour of the ISDA basis around 2018 has also been highlighted by Minnenna (2017), Ignazio Visco, Governor of the Bank of Italy in Visco (2018), Gros (2018) and Balduzzi et al. (2018b). See also Kremens (2019) and Cherubini (2019) for an analysis of the redenomination spread and De Santis (2019) for an analysis on the quanto spread."

            "content": "The impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China on U.S. economic growth will be negligible and short-lived, according to economists in a Reuters poll who nonetheless now say risks to their forecasts are skewed more to the downside.\n\nThe outbreak has also significantly increased the chance Beijing doesn't comply with all of the terms of a Jan. 15 initial trade agreement signed with Washington, potentially reigniting a damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nStill, medians from the Feb. 10-19 Reuters poll of over 100 economic forecasters found the overall U.S. economic growth outlook for this year unchanged compared with last month.\n\nThe forecast for growth in the current quarter was reduced just 0.1 percentage point to a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 1.5% - already slow, even by recent standards. The economy was then expected to grow 1.8-2.0% each quarter until end-2021.\n\n\"At this point, we are assuming the coronavirus impact will be relatively small, and more importantly, temporary. So whatever drag there is in the first quarter will largely be reversed in the second,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities.\n\n\"It will not have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. But that is certainly a risk for sure. I mean, that is the source to downside risk if it keeps escalating.\"\n\nGrowth is expected to pick up to 1.8% in the second quarter of this year, only slightly slower than the 1.9% forecast in the January poll.\n\nIn that survey, which was conducted before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global public health emergency, 56% of economists said the risks to their U.S. growth views were more to the upside.\n\nHowever, as the outbreak spread, that has switched around to nearly 70%, or 33 of 48 respondents now saying the opposite. Around 75,000 people have been reported as carriers of the virus globally, with over 2,000 confirmed dead.\n\nDespite these risks, the likelihood of a U.S. recession in the coming year only edged up to a median 23% from 20% in January.\n\n\"The threat the coronavirus outbreak poses in an environment of already subdued global growth underlines the potential for medium-term U.S. economic weakness,\" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\n\n\"It is impossible to forecast the path of the virus, but it increases the chances the Federal Reserve will cut rates at least once more to provide some support to the economy.\"\n\nWhile the consensus showed the Fed would keep rates unchanged at 1.50%-1.75% at least until the end of next year, Reuters analysis showed nearly 40% of economists polled now expect at least one rate cut at some point this year.\n\n\"We think the Fed will keep rates on hold, but we agree with the market that there are asymmetric risks to policy where easing is more likely than tightening,\" said Michelle Meyer, U.S. economist at BofA Global Research.\n\n\"With underlying economic data remaining robust, core inflation trending higher and policy already accommodative, there is a higher hurdle to cut this year than last.\"\n\nThe poll found that inflation as measured by the core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred gauge, would range between 1.8% and 1.9% until the second quarter of next year and touch the central bank's 2% target in the second half of 2021.\n\nWhen asked if the chance of non-compliance by Beijing with the terms of the initial trade agreement had increased significantly since the coronavirus outbreak, nearly two-thirds of economists, 30 of 48, said yes.\n\nThat stands in contrast to results from a separate poll last week on the hit to China's economy, in which about 56% of economists said the chance of non-compliance had not increased.\n\n\"If domestic activity in China remains severely negatively affected by the outbreak of the virus, in our eyes, it's highly likely the Chinese would try to reduce the purchases of U.S. goods they have promised,\" said Bernd Weidensteiner at Commerzbank.\n\n\"There is actually a paragraph in the Phase 1 agreement that in case of natural disasters...there is a way to purchase less than the promised amount, and they have a reason now that they cannot fully live up to their commitments, which are relatively generous,\" he added."

            "content": "Right now, it seems that this \"positive\" scenario for the United States will last for the full year of 2020.\n\nForeign risk-averse monies continue to flow into the United States as economic uncertainty, coupled with new news about the coronavirus from China, captures attention.\n\nWednesday morning, the dollar strengthened in foreign exchange markets as it took only $1.0790 to buy one euro.\n\nThe value of the US dollar rose again, and this time, the dollar cost of a euro dropped below $1.08. This is the first time since the middle of April 2017 that the price has fallen this low.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) has risen to just under 99.50, and again, one has to go back to the middle of April 2017 for the index to be so low.\n\nAs I wrote last week, the major driving force seems to be the risk-averse monies coming from around the world coming to the United States.\n\nAnd, there seems to be a reason for risk-averse monies to be nervous about a lot of things happening in the world. For example, the news coming out of Germany and out of Europe has seemingly gotten worse.\n\nChina's coronavirus situation seems to be getting worse as even Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is saying its earnings will be impacted.\n\nFurthermore, the US economy seems to be doing well, especially when compared with the performance of other major areas of the world, and the Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve continue to hold on to the trust of the financial community in terms of continuing to support current growth rates.\n\nAll this together also continues to support the US stock market.\n\nStock prices in the United States seem to be coming back today after dropping on Apple's concerns, which came out yesterday.\n\nEven with Apple's news, the NASDAQ index recovered and moved to a new daily high.\n\nThere are just two points that I would like to make on this movement in the value of the dollar.\n\nFirst, I believe that the strength of the US dollar gives us a clue about the \"general\" state of mind in global financial markets.\n\nFor whatever is going on in the United States, its economics and its politics, the managers of money in the world appear to believe that the best place to place their funds is in the United States and not elsewhere.\n\nAnd, given the political situation in the rest of the world, it appears as if these money managers believe that, although things are not in very good shape right now, they don't see the situation improving much, if at all, in the near future.\n\nFor example, given the strong role that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has played in the world over the years she has led Germany, it is hard to see the effort by some to get Ms. Merkel to resign her post early.\n\nReal leadership in the world seems to be particularly sparse these days.\n\nThe second part of this reflection considers how this picture plays within the United States itself.\n\nThe United States economy is going to do OK in 2020. Although the numbers on GDP growth may not be too strong, coming in around 2.0 percent to 2.2 percent, the actual economy, as I have been writing, may actually be stronger than these numbers indicate.\n\nFurthermore, with the Federal Reserve continuing to underwrite the expansion, as it has done for ten years, and with international financial markets supporting the US dollar with monetary flows, the economy should do all right.\n\nIt is going to be difficult for politicians to \"talk down\" the economy in this presidential election year.\n\nAs far as the dollar is concerned, it may be the case that breaking the $1.08 floor, the new range for the dollar/euro exchange rate may need to be dropped. Maybe the new range should be $1.0700 to $1.0900 from $1.080 to $1.1000. I am going to have to give this some more study.\n\nThe U. S. Dollar Index should rise at least to 100.00.\n\nThe important thing for now is that the US dollar has gotten stronger and will remain around this level for the foreseeable future. This should help to provide a positive appraisal for the United States economy in this election year.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Kaley Cuoco's Young Sheldon Role Confirmed: The Inside Story Behind That Big Bang Theory Easter Egg\n\nIf last week’s idol-hunting, fire token-swapping, Edge of Extinction-twisting Survivor premiere didn’t leave your head spinning, this one might just knock it off entirely.\n\nWinners at War may be the most complex season of Survivor yet… and frankly, we’re here for it. The 20 champions certainly have a long road ahead of them if they want to get close to that $2 million prize. What other twists and advantages lie waiting to be discovered, and which all-star will join Natalie and Amber on the Edge? Let’s find out.\n\nA SURVIVOR ECONOMY | We start on the Edge where Amber reflects on being ousted from the game. She’s bummed to have gotten the axe, but excited to still be in the running. Plus, she knows she can help Rob from the Edge, so hope is still alive for the Marianos. When Rob gets Amber’s fire token, he gets emotional. He doesn’t know for sure if it’s Amber, but he has a feeling. He wonders if the token could be from Sandra; conversely, if Sandra voted Amber out, this means war for Rob.\n\nIDOL HUNTERS | With Ben’s help, Denise finds an idol, but she must give half of it to someone else by sundown. The idol can only be used when played together. Denise tells Adam about the idol, but Ben knowing about it is bad news to Adam. Playing with the veteran makes him nervous because Ben’s a wild card. Ben bumbles his way up the beach asking, “Big happy family?” Sure, Jan Ben.\n\nKim isn’t used to playing from the bottom, so idol-hunting she goes, and an immunity idol she finds. Like Denise’s, she has to give half of it away. She decides to give half of it to Sophie, but Sophie says Kim shouldn’t be telling “the devil.” Information is always power in Survivor, and Kim might’ve just armed Sophie with the power to take her out. (I think it’s safe to say that Kim’s competition here is sliiightly more aggressive than her One World crew.)\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah and Tony try distancing themselves from each other, but in actuality, they reform their Cops Are Us alliance from Cagayan. Tony voted Sarah out during that season, so it’ll be interesting to see how far these two can go together.\n\nKEEPIN’ IT EDGY | Amber and Nat get another clue, but it leaves both of them scratching their heads. The women scour the island, but once Amber calls it quits, Natalie goes for water and finds the advantage. It allows a player to leave tribal council and return to camp before the votes are cast, essentially giving them immunity from the vote. Natalie sends the advantage to Jeremy, and he takes the deal, thankful that Natalie has his back, even from the Edge. “This Fire Token economy could change everything,” he says.\n\nIMMUNITY IS NOW UP FOR GRABS | Rob gets his first look at an Amber-free Dakal tribe and he. is. not. happy. “It’s tough, it’s a game, I get it,” he says. But it doesn’t look like he gets it. For the challenge, the tribes must race through a course with a cart to collect three chests that contain puzzle pieces. The winning tribe gets immunity and the classic Survivor spice kit. Dakal is the first to get all of their pieces to the end, giving Sandra and Sophie a huge head-start on the puzzle. Denise and Rob make quick work out of the first section of the puzzle and spend way too much time organizing their pieces. Dakal wins immunity, sending Sele back to tribal.\n\nSTRATEGY SESSION | Rob knows he blew it, but Ethan tells him he “sucked today” anyways. Regardless, Rob feels secure in the relationships he’s made thus far and eyes Ben or Jeremy for the vote-off. While Rob, Parv and Ethan strategize, Danni feels on the outs of the “old school” alliance. While venting to Ethan, Danni lets the “old school” agreement slip right in front of Ben! She then goes to Rob with a plan to vote out Parvati, who is Rob’s number one. (What is this woman thinking!?) Ben makes people nervous, Danni is being… Danni, and Adam, Michele and Jeremy discuss targeting Parvati. But is it the right time to take that risk?\n\nTHE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN | At tribal, Rob talks about how this season is more complex than the show has ever been, while Michele talks about how “reading people” is always difficult in this game. The tribe discusses how some castaways, like Ethan and Danni, have zero experience with idols and advantages. The conversation quickly turns when Ben calls out Danni’s error and then accuses Parv, Rob and Ethan of being far too paranoid. As Ben talks himself into a corner, dancing around some sort of point, Rob, Jeremy and Parvati start whispering. Rob then asks everyone to empty their bags so they can see who has the idol, but he’s too busy ruffling Ben’s feathers to notice Denise slyly hiding her idol… like a boss. After the tribe votes, Jeff tallies ’em up and Danni is sent packing to the Edge. She bequeaths her fire token to Denise on her way out.\n\nDanni certainly made a few critical errors there. Who did you think should’ve been voted off? Sound off in the comments below!"

            "content": "Saudi petrochemicals giant SABIC has hired public relations juggernaut Edelman for help in pulling off the global business conference tied to this year’s G-20 summit of leading rich and developing nations in Riyadh.\n\nThe contract, which runs from February until January 2021, notably calls on Edelman to help with media relations and event planning around the Business 20 (B20) dialogue forum with the international business community. The agreement is for $5.6 million, plus $1 million in estimated expenses — making it the most lucrative Middle East lobbying and public relations contract in more than a year.\n\nSaudi Arabia has made the B20, now in its 15th year, a top priority of its turn hosting the Group of 20 as it seeks to attract private investment in its quest to diversify its economy away from oil. The gathering, held a month before the G-20, serves as the voice of the private sector for policymakers. The G-20 leaders' summit will be held Nov. 21-22.\n\nEdelman declined to comment about the contract.\n\nAlso read\n\nThe forum is also vital for SABIC itself as the world’s fourth largest chemical company finds its place in Saudi Arabia’s plan to reform its economy by 2030. SABIC CEO Yousef Abdullah Al-Benyan is serving as chairman of B20 Saudi Arabia, tasked with leading the conference and finalizing B20 policy recommendations to the G-20 Presidency.\n\n“The twist on it is that Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has this Vision 2030 to radically alter the economy,” Simon Henderson, the director of the Gulf and Energy Policy program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told Al-Monitor. “And so the G-20 summit will serve as a showcase for this project.”\n\nThe centerpiece of Vision 2030, an initial public offering of a small share of Saudi Aramco stock to private investors, did not meet expectations amid slumping oil prices. But privatization still looms large in the kingdom despite international squeamishness over Riyadh’s human rights record and its bloody intervention in Yemen.\n\n“After the Aramco IPO, you're going to see other efforts at privatizations in the country,” said Karen Young, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and an Al-Monitor contributor. “So, that's going to be a push for the next year or so. It's to publicize and get and draw investor interest for other state firms, whether it's in health care or chemicals or whatever that they can prove that they're able to do these kinds of offerings.”\n\nSABIC is one of Saudi Arabia’s crown jewels as Riyadh looks to draw more foreign investment. Saudi Aramco is in the midst of a $69 billion takeover of the Saudi government’s Public Investment Fund’s 70% stake in the company.\n\n“I think it is in the interest of SABIC to keep showing that they’re a good company, a worthwhile company, so that when Saudi Aramco takes them over they’re treated fairly and honestly by Saudi Aramco and not just as a small addition,” said Jean-Francois Seznec, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center. “And if [the deal] didn’t go through they would still maintain their image in the world — and their image in the world is very, very good at this point.”\n\nSABIC is no stranger to influence campaigns in Washington, with the company’s US subsidiary spending nearly $460,000 on in-house lobbying focused on Congress in 2019. SABIC also paid King & Spalding $60,000 for work on “plastics and automotive applications issues” in the first half of 2019, though the firm did not disclose lobbying any US government entities. King & Spalding stopped working for SABIC at the end of June.\n\nFor now, only two Edelman employees are registered to work on the contract: Senior Vice President Debora Comenalli Murray and Vice President of Global Public Affairs Jere Sullivan."

            "content": "Lewis: You eventually got transferred to the plushest wing, and the best cell in that wing, surrounded by other white-collar criminals.\n\nAtkins: It was comfortable and uncomfortable: comfortable because I was around people who were more like me. I mean, I don't consort with City boys [bankers], but in Wandsworth they became my type. They were closer to me than the mentally ill drug addicts or the Romanian gangsters.\n\nBut it was uncomfortable because they'd all done things that were wrong as well. Arguably, things that harm society more than the mentally ill drug addicts. Some of them were responsible for dozens of people losing their life savings.\n\nLewis: The short-staffing of prison guards meant that the “White Collar Club” was doing lots of tasks—handing out paperwork, cleaning, counseling, running the library—that kept the place running.\n\nAtkins: Completely. And the White Collar Club would hand jobs out to each other. They wanted me there [in the best wing of the prison]. You were attractive to them simply because you weren't a nutter—because everyone had had a nutty cell mate or nutty neighbors.\n\nWhen the jobs would come in, Lance and Scott [two fellow prisoners at the top of the pecking order], they would be like a king handing out patronage. Later, I was being offered jobs and I didn’t want them, so I would hand them out like candy to people below me. At one point, I was doing seven jobs.\n\nLewis: The White Collar Club reacted badly when a violent, loud prisoner named Wayne moved into their section. What happened?\n\nAtkins: It was like, ‘This neighborhood has taken a turn for the worse. Who's at number 28? He has music on loud.’ It was uncomfortable because [Wayne] probably had a mental illness and had a terrible hand in life. We had all the advantages in life and squandered them.\n\nIn prison, though, you stop worrying about the outside world; because it's so closed off, I could have been on the moon. Instead you become fascinated and obsessed with all the stuff that's going on in your immediate environment … We were all interested in, you know, who's going to move into H-12.\n\nLewis: Because you can control so little, you become obsessed with what you can control.\n\nAtkins: And you want what your neighbors want. Once, we made a bin [trash can]. It took hours. And then we noticed that the lads in the cell next door, their bin had a lid. So we thought: We've got to get a lid. It is like, ‘Oh, they’ve got a swimming pool next door; we need a pool.’\n\nLewis: You worked doing education tests on incoming prisoners. How many were illiterate?\n\nAtkins: I'd say 50 percent were functionally illiterate. They could barely read or write.\n\nLewis: After a few months, you and your ex-partner were “running on completely different clocks” when she came to visit. Tell me about becoming “institutionalized.”"

The economy was then expected to grow 1.8-2.0% each quarter until end-2021.\n\n\"At this point, we are assuming the coronavirus impact will be relatively small, and more importantly, temporary. So whatever drag there is in the first quarter will largely be reversed in the second,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities.\n\n\"It will not have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. But that is certainly a risk for sure. I mean, that is the source to downside risk if it keeps escalating.\"\n\nGrowth is expected to pick up to 1.8% in the second quarter of this year, only slightly slower than the 1.9% forecast in the January poll.\n\nIn that survey, which was conducted before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global public health emergency, 56% of economists said the risks to their U.S. growth views were more to the upside.\n\nHowever, as the outbreak spread, that has switched around to nearly 70%, or 33 of 48 respondents now saying the opposite. Around 75,000 people have been reported as carriers of the virus globally, with over 2,000 confirmed dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. economic outlook https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/682/672/U.S.%20graphic%20feb.png\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these risks, the likelihood of a U.S. recession in the coming year only edged up to a median 23% from 20% in January.\n\n\"The threat the coronavirus outbreak poses in an environment of already subdued global growth underlines the potential for medium-term U.S. economic weakness,\" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\n\n\"It is impossible to forecast the path of the virus, but it increases the chances the Federal Reserve will cut rates at least once more to provide some support to the economy.\"\n\nWhile the consensus showed the Fed would keep rates unchanged at 1.50%-1.75% at least until the end of next year, Reuters analysis showed nearly 40% of economists polled now expect at least one rate cut at some point this year.\n\n\"We think the Fed will keep rates on hold, but we agree with the market that there are asymmetric risks to policy where easing is more likely than tightening,\" said Michelle Meyer, U.S. economist at BofA Global Research.\n\n\"With underlying economic data remaining robust, core inflation trending higher and policy already accommodative, there is a higher hurdle to cut this year than last.\"\n\nThe poll found that inflation as measured by the core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred gauge, would range between 1.8% and 1.9% until the second quarter of next year and touch the central bank's 2% target in the second half of 2021.\n\nWhen asked if the chance of non-compliance by Beijing with the terms of the initial trade agreement had increased significantly since the coronavirus outbreak, nearly two-thirds of economists, 30 of 48, said yes.\n\nThat stands in contrast to results from a separate poll last week on the hit to China's economy, in which about 56% of economists said the chance of non-compliance had not increased.\n\n\"If domestic activity in China remains severely negatively affected by the outbreak of the virus, in our eyes, it's highly likely the Chinese would try to reduce the purchases of U.S. goods they have promised,\" said Bernd Weidensteiner at Commerzbank.\n\n\"There is actually a paragraph in the Phase 1 agreement that in case of natural disasters...there is a way to purchase less than the promised amount, and they have a reason now that they cannot fully live up to their commitments, which are relatively generous,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Indradip Ghosh; Graphics by Vivek Mishra and Mumal Rathore, Polling by Manjul Paul and Sumanto Mondal; Editing by Ross Finley and Andrea Ricci)"

It uses a scorecard to make sure most people coming into the country are highly skilled workers. That will also reduce the dependence of industries like construction on what the government calls “cheap labor.”\n\nThe problem for someone like Ellis, with a multicultural European workforce, is that 70% of the EU workers currently in the U.K. wouldn’t make the cut under the rules, which will come into force on Jan. 1 2021. “Employers will need to adjust,” the Home Office said.\n\nAfter years of political sclerosis, a deadlocked parliament and several court rulings, Johnson won a renewed mandate from voters in December’s election to make Brexit a reality. He duly delivered on Jan. 31, with a standstill agreement until next year while he tries to strike a trade deal.\n\nQuicktakeWhat Brexit Did and Didn’t Change on Jan. 31\n\nNow, it’s the execution of his goal to return Britain to the vanguard of economic power that faces a whole new set of potentially unreconcilable challenges.\n\nIn Birmingham, the U.K.’s second-largest city, Ellis was speaking the day after Johnson rubber-stamped one of Europe’s biggest infrastructure projects this month, the so-called HS2 high-speed rail link connecting with London and, later, Manchester.\n\nJohnson praised the route as a way to connect “left-behind” communities in the north and midlands to the center of wealth in the south. It’s been controversial, with even members of his own Conservatives questioning costs that could rise to more than 100 billion pounds ($129 billion).\n\nThe government’s budget, scheduled for March 11, is expected to announce further spending to reward former industrial heartlands where Johnson convinced voters to back his party, some for the first time since before World War II.\n\nBut regenerating entire regions takes manpower, and much of Britain’s comes from the bloc it just exited. What’s more, huge developments like multi-billion railway links could drain labor resources from smaller projects in the areas around the big cities that embraced Brexit as a cry for help.\n\n“HS2 is a massive plus,” said John Carlin, Wates Construction Ltd.’s managing director for the midlands. He said he trusted the government to get the immigration system right, though “undoubtedly there is that concern that there’s going to be a strain on numbers,” he said. “We don’t have the domestic workforce to cope with all the growth in the industry.”\n\nOne in 10 workers in construction was born outside the U.K. In London, the EU provides around one in three, and the industry has long expressed fears that they’re not recruiting enough young British labor to fill the gap left by a lack of new people coming from Europe.\n\nWith the transition agreement between the U.K. and EU set to expire at the end of this year, the clock is ticking, said Rico Wojtulewicz, head of housing and planning policy for the National Federation of Builders.\n\nIt takes at least two years to train a skilled builder who then needs another two years of experience on site, said Wojtulewicz, a Birmingham native of Polish origin. “So how you’re going to get that done in 11 months, I have no idea.”\n\nStory continues"

            "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping shakes hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing\n\nBy Howard Schneider\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A slowdown in U.S. growth last year was at least partly the fault of President Donald Trump's global trade battles and the resulting hit to business investment, the administration's top economist said on Thursday in an outlook for the coming years.\n\n\"Once we got renegotiation of trade agreements, we saw uncertainty in the market, and investment took a hit,\" Tomas Philipson, acting chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in a briefing with reporters about the CEA's annual Economic Report of the President.\n\nPhilipson said the CEA had only done internal estimates of the impact but referred journalists to a Federal Reserve study https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/does-trade-policy-uncertainty-affect-global-economic-activity-20190904.htm that said trade uncertainty may have reduced growth in U.S. and world gross domestic products by as much as 1%.\n\nTrump has blamed the Fed as the economy slowed from a 2.9% annualized growth rate in 2018 to 2.3% last year, and the central bank did trim rates three times to boost the economy.\n\nBut policymakers cited trade-related risks as a chief reason for the rate cuts. Philipson agreed with Trump that it was necessary to confront China on trade but said it did cause short-term disruption.\n\n\"I don't know if we fully agree on the quantitative point, but on the qualitative we certainly agree ... It is well known, if we have uncertainty, investment takes a hit,\" Philipson said.\n\nIt was a rare public acknowledgement from the administration of the costs of a trade war characterized as largely beneficial to the U.S. economy despite lingering questions about who pays the price of higher tariffs, whether global supply chains will be reorganized to the U.S. economy's benefit and even whether China will deliver on commitments made under a Phase 1 trade deal.\n\nPhilipson said he expects investment to rebound this year \"if uncertainty settles down, which we hope it will.\"\n\nThe CEA report, an annual exercise that is one part review of events and one part aspirational statement, outlined what will likely prove key talking points for Trump's reelection campaign: The economy now is doing better than it did under President Barack Obama; it only started doing better under Trump and is poised to thrive even more if Trump administration proposals are enacted.\n\nThose conclusions are likely to get pushback from Democrats who note that the jobs recovery, for example, began under Obama and accelerated in his second term.\n\nA rise in the net worth of the poorest half of Americans, cited in the report and in Trump's recent State of the Union speech, has been largely driven by a rise in home ownership and home values that began late in Obama's term.\n\nThe CEA report projected economic growth this year will hit 3.1% and continue at 3% annually through 2024, as long as a full suite of suggested reforms are enacted including trade deals, an infrastructure plan and immigration rules that would favor more skilled workers.\n\nThose changes, the CEA contends, would boost the annual increase in labor productivity from below 2 percent annually to 2.6 percent, a rate more akin to the high-growth 1990s than the more tepid growth of recent years.\n\nFed policymakers, whose forecasts do not take into account any of the administration's policy proposals, see the economy growing around 2% this year, with even the most optimistic seeing growth at no more than 2.3%, unchanged from last year's pace.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Dan Burns and Cynthia Osterman)"

            "content": "“I don’t know what lies ahead in the future. I am still trying to find a job but my hope is dying. I feel isolated and depressed,” says Jyoti, a 24-year-old with a postgraduate degree in business studies. “Every time I read about the economy of India, it is barely happy news.” Like Jyoti, many are worried about the depleting state of the Indian economy. Despite being consoled by the Home Ministry, that it is temporary, the consequences of an unstable economy on psychosocial well-being cannot be overlooked.\n\nFrom 6.6 to 4.5 percent in gross domestic product, the country’s economy propelled into an insidious slowdown. Reportedly it is carrying with itself a demonising inflation, a job crisis with the highest unemployment rate in 45 years, and a subtle possibility of a recession as recently warned by Nobel laureate, Abhijit Banerjee. What this means to the common individual is evident in the context of livelihood but in India, less attention has been given to the mental health outcomes of the poor economy.\n\nThe first step to exploring this connection stems from recognising the mental health of a person as a significant contributor to a nation’s economic capacity. Mental health is an amalgam of biological, psychological, social, interpersonal and occupational functioning which is eventually responsible for growth not just of the individual alone but also of the community they are a part of. Hence, in this context, mental health is equivalent to being addressed as mental capital.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recognises economic crisis having a major role in the development of mental health problems. In a report that studied this impact in the European continent highlighted a reciprocal relationship between poor mental health and economic depletion. Unemployment, poverty, job insecurity, inflation are all drivers of poor mental health outcomes but conversely mental health issues also affect economic growth.\n\nThe “signs and symptoms”\n\nThe overall economic slowdown shows up into the perils of mental turmoil in ways it is associated with people's lives — be it about jobs, affordability or other financial matters such as debts. Unemployment becomes one of the primary “symptoms” that lead to mood-based issues such as depression and anxiety or an increase in consumption of substances such as alcohol.\n\nIn the month of December, the unemployment rate in India escalated to 7.7 percent as per the data released by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Synchronising to this information, 14 percent of all the suicides recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau in 2018 were due to joblessness.\n\nIt is likely for companies and organisations to lay off employees in large numbers to survive economic slowdowns causing a surge in stress that may escalate quickly. Major firms such as OYO, Cognizant and OLA have reportedly let go of many employees as a result of this decline. “I don’t think I am suicidal but I am definitely on that path,” says Vaibhav*, an IT worker based in Delhi who was recently a part of a massive lay off in one of the companies. “I am applying to other places but this has affected what I think of myself and my abilities.”\n\nFeelings of worthlessness, helplessness, insecurity, loss of autonomy become primary markers of distress caused by mass unemployment rates. Research on mental health impact of recessions in Spain has highlighted such feelings among people who were laid off following a negative labour demand shock — an abrupt downfall in demand of workers.\n\n“What the slow economy does is that it really intensifies the already prevailing ideas of capitalism. It asks people to work harder than ever before. Competition is not only implied but normalised, promoted as the only way to be,” says Radhika Sharma, a Mumbai-based psychiatric social worker. “What workplaces tell people about themselves becomes a strong voice that guides their sense of self and their identity.”\n\nOther than joblessness, job-burnout is also a critical consequence of economic slowdown. Now recognised as a diagnosable condition as per WHO, burnout is a prolonged response to workplace stress, characterised by emotional exhaustion, detachment from customers/clients and feelings of personal inefficacy. In the 2008 slowdown in India, employees belonging to manufacturing and healthcare sectors suffered moderate to high levels of burnout.\n\n“One of the primary feelings that I work with in therapeutic conversations is that of ‘I am not good enough’. Where did this really come from? With dwindling jobs and economy, where is the space to even think about these links? As always with the economy taking a hit, we see mental health being pushed to the margins,” Radhika adds.\n\nWho will suffer the most?\n\n3,92,705 is the projected number of farmer suicides between 1995-2020 as predicted by PC Bodh, an Indian Economic Officer (1987 Batch) in his recent book, Farmer Suicides in India: A Policy Malignancy. There have been debates whether farmer suicides are mental health or an economic issue but this polarisation does not benefit anyone. Rather there is a push for a narrative which views mental health as both an economic and eventually a political issue.\n\nFarmers remain one of the most adversely affected groups of a poor economy in India despite their ample contribution to the country's growth. Additionally, people from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those intersecting with other marginalisations are bound to experience more distress resulting from economic strains. As per the report by WHO, these groups include but are not limited to children, single-parent families, ethnic minorities, migrants and older people.\n\n“There is a whole lot of data telling us that mental health and economic class are deeply interlinked. So are other factors such as caste and gender. It is indeed very likely for people belonging to such sections to be on the primary receiving end of such blows,” Radhika adds, reflecting on the populations likely to suffer the most from a bad economy.\n\nA population usually left out of such discussions includes women working in informal sectors. In a paper, Indra Chakravarthi highlights the plight of women and how their working conditions affect physical and mental health. The paper quotes, “The impact on women’s health, of the double burden of poor working conditions as well as of taking care of families with such poor wages, its implications for access to essential goods and services, can only be understated.”\n\n“Informal sector is a whole different gamut,” Radhika says. “Homemakers yet another. I also do know that many mothers I work with are finding it harder to get back to jobs after having children or having to work harder if they find a job to prove their relevance.”\n\nIt is not surprising to note that in a world dominated by capitalist thought more people seem to be worried about how a person’s deteriorating mental health will prove to be a “burden” on the country’s economy instead the other way around. The question remains: what solutions are suggestible to fight this deeply complex malady?\n\nWhile psychotherapy and medications account for primary responses to issues, they only operate on the surface. Radhika advocates for changes on the larger scale to reach the roots of the problem. “We definitely need systemic level changes to support people’s personal journeys of healing. Else, sustainable well-being will always continue to remain a challenge. People who have access to modes of healing such as therapy struggle to meet challenges when they go outside because the outside world (for eg, economy) continues to fail them by pushing the finish line farther and farther away.”\n\n*Some names have been changed to protect the identities of the individual.\n\nFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.

I think this is not good for our country because if you don’t recognise the problems that you face, you are not likely to find credible answers to take corrective action,” he said.\n\n10:40 AM\n\nGST biggest madness of the century: Subramanian Swamy\n\nBJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday described the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as the ‘biggest madness’ of 21st century and called for radical reforms like abolishing income tax to achieve 10 per cent growth rate to make the country an economic superpower by 2030.\n\nHe said the country has to do something radical given the last one year of economic crisis.\n\nThe BJP leader exuded confidence that by 2030 India will become the most developed country and challenge the US, but said for this the country will have to grow at 10 per cent per annum.\n\nHe was delivering a talk on “India: An Economic Superpower by 2030”, organised here by the Pragna Bharati. IANS\n\n10:30 AM\n\nUS trade deficit with India sign of strength, Trump doesn't understand this: NYU economist\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s worry about trade deficits with countries like India “does not make much sense” and he should instead see it as a sign of American strength, a top economist from the New York University’s Stern School of Business told IANS here.\n\n“A lot of economists look at trade as ships going back and forth carrying cars and TV sets and grain and soybeans and they say well, that’s what’s really important, and the trade deficit is just a spin—off. But you could look at it another way and I say that maybe the finance is more important than the trade,” NYU’s Richard Sylla told IANS here on Wednesday in response to a question on an elusive India—US trade deal that’s been dogged by escalating tensions and constantly shifting goalposts.\n\nSylla is Chairman of the Board, Museum of American Finance and Professor Emeritus of Economics at New York University Stern School of Business\n\nSylla explained that America may simply have to run a trade deficit “in order to allow people in other countries to get the dollars to buy our stocks”. IANS\n\n10:15 AM\n\nIMF chief urges G20 nations to take actions on trade, climate\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Wednesday urged the Group of 20 (G20) economies to take further actions to reduce uncertainties.\n\n“I believe there are three areas where the finance ministers and central bank governors can make progress in providing more certainty about future actions during the G20 meetings in Saudi Arabia: Trade, Climate, and Inequality,” Georgieva said in a blog post prior to the upcoming G20 meetings scheduled later this week, the Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe IMF chief noted that the China—US phase—one economic and trade agreement eliminated some of the immediate negative consequences for global growth, but the world still needs a modern global trading system that can unleash the full potential of services and e—commerce while protecting intellectual property rights. IANS\n\n10:00 AM\n\nIndia Fintech Festival postponed due to coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has resulted in the Union and Maharashtra governments on Wednesday deciding to postpone the ‘India Fintech Festival’, scheduled to take place early next month.\n\nThe festival, which aims to establish the financial capital as an important centre for the upcoming financial technologies stream, was scheduled to take place from March 4-5.\n\nNo new dates have been announced by the organisers. PTI\n\n9:45 AM\n\nSensex, Nifty open marginally lower\n\nAshish Rukhaiyar reports:\n\nEquities traded marginally lower during the first hour of the trading session on Thursday amidst an overall weak trend in the Asian markets as Japan reported two deaths on account of coronavirus and South Korea also reported a ruse in such cases.\n\nAt 9:30, the 30-share was trading at 41,313.78, down 9.22 points or 0.02%. The broader Nifty was almost unchanged at 12,125.70.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, the benchmarks of Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan were also trading lower during the day. Back in India, the market breadth was slightly positive with nearly 750 stocks in the green as against 466 declines.\n\n9:30 AM\n\nGovt should offer one-time settlement to telcos for principal due amount, waive penalties: Garg\n\nFormer finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg on Wednesday said the government should offer a one-time settlement scheme to the telecom companies to pay the principal due amount as per the AGR definition and waive the penal interest and penalties.\n\nThe massive Rs 1.47 lakh crore of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues are pushing telecom firms to the brink.\n\nIn a blog titled ‘Rebuilding Telecom Business in India’, Garg said the telecom crisis in India is not just limited to AGR-related issues. PTI\n\n9:20 AM\n\nFitch sees tough operating environment for Indian FIs\n\nIndia’s financial institutions would continue to face difficult operating environment amid the macro—economic slowdown and weak funding conditions, Fitch Ratings said here on Wednesday.\n\nFitch expects India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slow to 4.6 per cent in FY20 from 6.8 per cent in FY19, led by a squeeze in credit availability from non—bank financial institutions (NBFIs) and deterioration in business and consumer confidence. It expects a modest rebound to 5.6 per cent in FY21.\n\n“Funding conditions are likely to remain weak and Indian FIs risk—averse in the year ahead — in line with Fitch’s negative sector outlook for both banks and NBFIs,” the report said.\n\nAccording to the report, the asset—quality tensions may intensify, if stresses on non—banks, real estate and SMEs remained unresolved. IANS\n\n9:10 AM\n\nIndian Bank eyes lending to start-ups\n\nPublic sector lender Indian Bank is mulling the option of lending a helping hand to start-ups, said a top official.\n\n“Instead of lending Rs. 100 crore to corporates, which carries a higher risk, let us give Rs. 10 crore each to 10 start-ups, where the risk is less and spread out,” said Padmaja Chunduru, managing director and chief executive officer, Indian Bank.\n\nThe idea to help start-ups, as a new activity, emerged at one of the town hall meetings Ms. Chunduru had with the officials of Allahabad Bank and Indian Bank in the last few months. Allahabad Bank is set to merge with Indian Bank on March 31.\n\n9:00 AM\n\nSwiggy raises $113 million from investors led by Prosus\n\nFood ordering and delivery platform Swiggy on Wednesday said it has raised USD 113 million (over Rs 805 crore) in the latest funding round led by existing investor Prosus NV.\n\nMeituan Dianping and Wellington Management Company also participated in the funding round.\n\nHaving grown beyond food delivery, the company aims to use the funds to further develop its new lines of business, addressing visible gaps in the market, Swiggy said in a statement.\n\nThe company will continue to invest in new growth areas (Stores, Go and SuprDaily) as it delivers on its promise of bringing unparalleled convenience to the lives of urban consumers, it added.

            "content": "STATE DEPARTMENT - Top American officials are warning that the ability to protect intellectual property is under a grave threat if a Chinese-backed candidate becomes the new director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a self-funding agency of the United Nations that handles patents, trademarks and industrial designs.\n\nIn early March, WIPO is scheduled to nominate a candidate to the position of director general.\n\n“This is a big deal,” Keith Krach, undersecretary of state for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, told VOA Wednesday.\n\n“We're tracking that important [nomination],” Krach said. “Key to economic security is protecting United States assets, and one of those is intellectual property. And it's ironic that China has a candidate, where they probably are responsible for 90% of intellectual property theft, cyber hacking and all of that. So I think a lot of nations are really questioning that.”\n\nWeeks into the U.S. plan to host a special summit with the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN), Krach said Washington is doubling down to advance the U.S.-ASEAN strategic partnership, amid concerns that China is expanding its influence and driving a wedge between U.S. alliances in the Southeast Asian bloc.\n\nPhilippines President Rodrigo Duterte, left, shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during an ASEAN Summit, in Manila, Philippines, Nov. 13, 2017.\n\nThough U.S. President Donald Trump attended the annual ASEAN summit in 2017, he skipped the regular summits in 2018 and 2019, sending Vice President Mike Pence to attend in 2018, and White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien to attend in 2019.\n\nWhile members of ASEAN have responded positively to the U.S. invitation for the March 14 meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada, the event could be postponed if the coronavirus outbreak worsens.\n\nThe following are excerpts from the interview. They have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nVOA: In early March, the World Intellectual Property Organization is expected to nominate a candidate to the position of director general, are you tracking the election?\n\nKRACH: We're tracking that important, important [nomination] because, you know, key to economic security is protecting United States assets and one of those is intellectual property. And it's ironic that China has a candidate, where they probably are responsible for 90% of intellectual property theft, cyber hacking and all of that. So I think a lot of nations are really questioning that. And we know there's a great Singaporean candidate. And so, this is a big deal.\n\nVOA: What is high on the agenda in the coming U.S.-ASEAN special summit?\n\nKRACH: I think it's really three things. The first one is to look at this economic model of the United States, of freedom and pro-growth policies, it's really a model to hold up to the rest of the world. And if you look at our economy, the results speak for themselves in terms of record-level unemployment, GDP growth, productivity, all of that. So it's to provide a model.\n\nThe second one is to leverage the innovation and resources of the private sector, and really bring that to bear, in terms of further economic growth.\n\nAnd then the third one is to establish a level playing field with a set of trust principles to build out that economic growth in conjunction with our allies and our partners and our friends, and particularly in the ASEAN region, where it's so strategic.\n\nAnd so many of these countries are: “Hey, you know, how can we, how can we improve our business climate, how can we increase the capabilities of our human capital? Give it ... share with us some of your best practice in terms of security, justice, regulations for particular sectors.\" So this is we're really there to really support these countries, help these countries, and really help their growth in terms of on the economic front, but also help economic security, and, you know, as President Trump said, economic security is national security.\n\nVOA: You mentioned ASEAN members are U.S. allies. What is the Trump administration's approach to ASEAN as a regional bloc? Has the U.S. ignored it, allowing Southeast Asia to grow closer to China?\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo crosses his arms for the traditional \"ASEAN handshake\" with Chinese FM Wang Yi and fellow diplomats, during the 26th ASEAN Regional Forum, Bangkok, Thailand, Aug. 2, 2019.\n\nKRACH: I think President Trump knows how important the ASEAN [is], he's put a particular focus on it, and we've really doubled down.\n\nAnd you know, I think it was exemplified in the Indo-Pacific forum that was in Bangkok, you know just at the end of last year. We brought over hundreds of U.S. executives and we had all the nations from the ASEAN region there. And, you know, because, hey, these countries are looking to that American model as a beacon of hope for not just prosperity, but also for freedom. And I think people understand there is no sustainable prosperity without liberty.\n\nVOA: Could you talk about Trump administration's policy on WTO [the World Trade Organization] that some critics say has crippled WTO's ability to handle trade disputes? Do you think WTO should be replaced and why?\n\nKRACH: I think a big, one of the big issues with the WTO is if you look at a country, it's the second biggest economy in the world, claiming the developing nation status and all the benefits that go around with that. When I was over in Korea, I really applauded the Korean leadership in terms of no longer claiming developing nation status, and I said you know that's a great role model for China.\n\nSo it I think it comes back to that question in terms of, you know, multilateral organizations, when they're being used to create an unlevel playing field. I think this is the big issue that President Trump has with that, as I think we all do once you dig into it.\n\nVOA: What is the initiative about “Deal Teams?”\n\nKRACH: “Yesterday we launched the DC Central Deal Team to support U.S. businesses around the world. And also, in terms of bringing foreign direct investment into the United States and actually it's part of our broader mission in terms of economic security, as well as building an economic growth network around the world, with our allies and so with the DC Central Deal Team. It's to take economic statecraft to the next level. And as well as centralize a lot of the support that we can provide our field. Deal teams out there in the embassies, as well as match them up with businesses as well as matching up with the 28 financing arms of the United States government.\n\nVOA: Could you please highlight the Deal Teams’ plan to expand U.S. exports and investments to Africa?\n\nKRACH: Yes. So, this is, you know, an interagency integrated effort. So for example, we had leaders there at the launch from the Commerce Department, from Trade, from the Treasury, from the DFC [Development Finance Corporation], from Export-Import Bank, from U.S.A.I.D., from the Department of Transportation.\n\nSo first of all, it's that centralized approach to put behind, you know, the amazing American private sector, which is kind of the envy of the world. And you know what's interesting for me is in the last few months, I've had about 60 bilaterals with you know, 60 different nations, and you know the number one thing is like, \"Hey, what can you do to help us bring more of us private sector to our country?\" So this is really a great catalyst, a great facilitating tool to take that to the next level."

            "content": "Fiddling with a string of prayer beads, Saudi palace adviser Fahad Toonsi leaned forward in his seat to share a rare story from the crown prince’s inner circle.With the kingdom about to embark on a year in the international spotlight as host of this year’s Group of 20 gatherings, Prince Mohammed bin Salman had rejected event logos designed by some of the world’s top agencies in his pursuit of something typically Saudi. Time was running out, Toonsi told his audience of top Saudi journalists, but the prince wouldn’t budge.They eventually chose a symbol that riffs on a traditional form of weaving by a 28-year-old local designer, Mohammed Al-Hawas. Leading the grouping “is something that calls for great pride from us as Saudis,” explained Toonsi, who’s also the head of the kingdom’s G-20 secretariat.The top-level attention to detail reflects what’s at stake for Saudi Arabia as it welcomes leaders from the world’s biggest economies after a period in which Prince Mohammed’s reformist zeal has often been overshadowed by outrage over a murdered critic, a crackdown on dissent denounced by human rights groups, and the kingdom’s leading role in the grinding five-year war in Yemen While many are likely to find irony in Saudi Arabia hosting global meetings focused on climate change and female empowerment -- the conservative Islamic kingdom is an oil powerhouse where women were only recently allowed to drive and strict dress rules are being cautiously relaxed -- Saudi officials see only opportunities.Presiding over the club that represents at least 80% of global economic output will provide an opportunity, they hope, to improve that badly tarnished international reputation and advertise efforts to establish the kingdom as a business and tourism destination, key pillars of Prince Mohammed’s push to diversify the economy.On Saturday, finance ministers and central bankers will descend on Riyadh for the G-20’s first cabinet-level meeting, and events will culminate in a leaders’ summit in November.“The spotlight’s on the kingdom,” said Saudi media minister Turki Al-Shabanah, on stage beside Toonsi at an event in Riyadh this week. “How can we take advantage of this chance to tell our story and talk about it in a positive way?”That’s no simple task after two years dominated by stories about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, the detention of activists, and most recently an allegation by Amazon.com boss Jeff Bezos -- vehemently denied by Saudi officials -- that Prince Mohammed personally hacked his phone.“There were very serious incidents, which give the impression the country is in complete domestic confusion, and does not respect the courtesy rules of international diplomacy,” said Dorothee Schmid, head of the Turkey and Middle East Program at Ifri, a leading French institute for international relations. “The stakes are high in terms of image and credibility for this G-20.”Several of those incidents remain unresolved. Women’s rights activist Loujain Al Hathloul, who faces charges that include calling for regime change and communicating with diplomats and foreign journalists, is still on trial while others arrested alongside her are stuck in legal limbo or still in jail. The Saudi-led coalition’s bombing campaign in Yemen continues despite efforts to end the war, a rift with neighboring Qatar remains unresolved, and full diplomatic relations with Canada have yet to be reinstated after a spat in 2018.While there was no indication that attendees were boycotting the G-20, as they did previous events in Saudi Arabia in the wake of Khashoggi’s killing, there will be some notable absences this weekend. As of Wednesday, the U.K. wasn’t sending a high-level delegation, nor was China, Russia or Turkey. The central bank governors of Germany and India, and South Africa’s finance minister, also weren’t expected to attend.Those who do will get a first hand look at the infrastructure investment the prince’s economic blueprint is fueling in the capital Riyadh, including the red and white concrete barriers that have gridlocked the city as workers push to finish a massive metro project.Almost 60 hotels are being built in Riyadh alone, according to Lodging Econometrics, a U.S. real-estate consultancy. Eight may be ready by the time G-20 leaders arrive in November. While that would add some 1,000 rooms to the roughly 17,000 that already exist, finding suitable accommodation for all delegations could still be a challenge: Osaka, which hosted last year’s summit, planned for 30,000 attendees.Saudi Arabia expects around 10,000 visitors for the final summit itself, Toonsi said. As well as G-20 events, the kingdom plans to host more than 50 conferences and forums this year that will attract “no less than 250,000 visitors,” he said.The surge in construction could give the Saudi economy a boost. Jadwa Investment, a Riyadh-based investment firm, predicts that the G-20 will spur an additional 0.2% growth in the non-oil economy this year, with an increase in business tourism propping up consumption.But at the event where Toonsi spoke, the focus was consolidating the kingdom’s soft power. As servers with golden trays passed out tiny cups of tea, officials discussed ways to change international perceptions of Saudi Arabia.“This is our chance to inspire the world with our identity and vision,” said Fatima Al Qarni, a member of the consultative Shura council.Under Prince Mohammed, the government has loosened social restrictions, sponsoring mixed-gender concerts and ending a practice that required women to seek approval of a male guardian to travel. Many Saudis fervently support the leadership and dismiss criticism as attempts to undermine the transition.However, it’s the simultaneous political crackdown that’s dominated global headlines since 2017, when Prince Mohammed led a controversial anti-corruption campaign, detaining dozens of the kingdom’s most powerful men in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton hotel, the same venue where the G-20 will be held.Saudi officials want to turn that narrative around. Toonsi pointed out that Saudi’s G-20 presidency coincides with the kingdom opening for tourism. Officials plan to roll out the red carpet of Saudi hospitality, showing visitors the changes going on in the kingdom, he said.As the event concluded, organizers passed out pins embossed with the logo, a swirling ribbon patterned like a Bedouin tapestry.“This is just the beginning,” said Al-Shabanah, the media minister."

            "content": "Three weeks ago, Mad Money host Jim Cramer raised eyebrows after claiming that the oil industry was in the “death knell phase” and that “fossil fuel stocks are now like tobacco stocks”.\n\n“I’m done with fossil fuels ... they’re just done. We’re starting to see divestment all over the world,” Cramer said. “You’re seeing divestiture by a lot of different funds. It’s going to be a parade. It’s going to be a parade that says, ‘Look, these are tobacco and we’re not going to own them,’” Cramer opined in his usual fashion.\n\nIn the past, Cramer has received plenty of blowback about his stance on fossil fuels, and this time it was not any different. The polemic by the hard-hitting former hedge funder rubbed many in energy circles the wrong way, with some finding the claims flippant and outlandish.\n\nOne aggrieved respondent was Chevron Corp. chairman and CEO Michael Wirth, who predictably came to the industry’s defense.\n\nOil Not in Terminal Decline\n\nWirth said it’s unfair to compare the oil and gas industry to tobacco because oil actually plays a big role in the global economy, while tobacco can be more easily done away with.\n\n“The reality is the world runs on the energy system that we have today,” Wirth said Friday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box”. “I think the comparison to tobacco is not an appropriate one at all. If tobacco use were ceased today, I think the world would be just fine. If we ceased use of all hydrocarbon products today, the world would not be fine, and I think that’s the reality.”\n\nWhich is obviously true.\n\nTobacco and alcohol stocks are regarded as sin stocks because people will continue to happily consume these commodities even in poor economic cycles--their life-threatening side effects notwithstanding.\n\nYet in the global north, the cigarette industry has been in terminal decline for decades now, with sales volumes recently tumbling in the double-digits. Incumbents like Phillip Morris and Altria are only barely hanging on after launching a series of RRPs (Reduced Risk Products) that can replace some of this lost business.\n\nRelated: The World’s Top LNG Producer Is In Trouble\n\nFurther, tobacco products exhibit lower price inelasticity compared to energy products like oil and gas, meaning demand is more strongly influenced by price. One study done in 28 EU countries found that a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes resulted in a significant reduction in demand. The paper concluded by saying that all EU countries ought to levy higher tobacco taxes in order to increase consumer prices and in effect reduce cigarette consumption.\n\nIn contrast, the demand for oil is relatively inelastic with respect to price, mainly because oil has few direct substitutes. Similarly, demand for oil is relatively inelastic with respect to income especially in the advanced economies\n\nIf anything, oil demand is still rising mainly fueled by growing energy demand across the globe.\n\nIn 2018, the IEA reported that worldwide energy demand grew 2.3% Y/Y, the fastest pace over the decade. Fossil fuels met nearly 70% of that demand growth with renewables meeting the rest.\n\nIn 2019, oil demand grew sluggishly during the first half of the year before surging 1.1 million b/d during the third quarter. Supply growth, however, clocked in at more than 1.5 million b/d after Saudi Arabia’s situation normalized, which in effect kept the market oversupplied.\n\nThe IEA sees oil demand continuing to grow into the 2030s, while peak oil forecasts--the theorized point in time when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum will be reached before entering a terminal decline--range from the early 2020s to the 2040s.\n\nIt’s quite evident that what’s ailing the oil and gas industry is not dramatically lower consumption--as is the case with the tobacco industry--but rather persistent oversupply mainly due to American shale.\n\nCan Oil Bounce Back?\n\nWirth made a bold prediction that the sector can and will recover, and that the stocks will head higher once again.\n\n“We’ve been in a rough period of time. Commodity prices had a historic collapse last decade. They’re still very low because we’ve got a well supplied market, and I think companies have had to re-size their investments accordingly,” he said.\n\nRelated: The New ‘Must-Have’ For Energy Hedge Funds\n\nStory continues"

Picture taken February 17, 2020. cnsphoto via REUTERS\n\nThe Chinese manufacturing engine that powers much of the world economy is struggling to restart after an extended Lunar New Year break, hindered by travel and quarantine restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus epidemic and still in place in many parts of the country.\n\nCase in point: in the southern China manufacturing hub of Dongguan, a factory that makes vaporizers and other products had just half of its workforce of 40 last week and was struggling to function without key personnel.\n\n“The quality inspectors, they’re all out,” said Renaud Anjoran, who runs the factory. “One is stuck in Hubei, the other is in an area with no transportation open.”\n\nAnjoran said other Dongguan manufacturers were also scrambling with half their normal staff levels, with some having even less than that.\n\nThe problems are exacerbating pain inflicted by loss of business from the U.S.-China trade war and present huge logistical challenges as companies, many dependent on migrant workers, grapple with a myriad of restrictions that differ by province, city and local district.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday rescinded a quarterly sales target made just weeks ago, saying the ramp up of factories in China was slower than anticipated. Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) have had to suspend some production - not just in China but also at home - for lack of parts.\n\nSome smaller firms, particularly in Southeast Asia and reliant on supplies from China, are having to make tough decisions.\n\nTaiwan’s Sica New Materials abruptly shut its factory in Thailand at the end of January, laying off about 350 workers.\n\n“They couldn’t produce because raw materials weren’t being sent from China,” said Pairote Panthakarn from the government’s welfare and labor protection office in Kanchanaburi province, where the factory is located. Sica New Materials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSinoproud Cambodia Garments Co Ltd, whose customers include fashion retailer Zara’s parent Inditex (ITX.MC), told Reuters it may scale back production as stocks of fabric were getting low.\n\n“We hope we get the product in March and if we don’t get the product in March, we might just have to cut back and put the workers on half pay,” said general manager Tu Ailan.\n\nNearly half of 109 U.S. companies responding to a poll by Shanghai’s American Chamber of Commerce said plant shutdowns have already had an impact on their supply chains, while almost all of the remainder expect an impact within the next month.\n\nThe outbreak, slow pace of business resumption and its impact on the global economy is set to dominate discussions at this weekend’s G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Riyadh, though Chinese counterparts will not attend as they focus on efforts to limit the fallout.\n\nThe coronavirus, described by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva as a global health emergency and “our most pressing uncertainty” is set to knock 0.5 percentage points off global growth in the first quarter for a growth rate of 2.5%, Morgan Stanley economists estimate. They predict China’s GDP will expand just 4.2% in the quarter from a year earlier, down from 6% in last quarter.\n\nFREIGHT ACHES\n\nEven if factories have enough workers, the transportation of supplies and finished goods has also been a major headache.\n\n“The resumption of motor transport is very slow and curbs production,” said an executive at a steel mill in the eastern province of Shandong, citing insufficient drivers and a plethora of checkpoints slowing down traffic.\n\n“The situation is easing now, but total recovery might need to wait till the end of the month,” said the executive who was not authorized to speak to media and declined to identified.\n\nThe shortage of workers at Chinese ports has resulted in fewer calls from container shipping lines, a situation likely to result in months of delivery delays, while some air cargo firms such as Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) have reduced services in response to crew health concerns and uncertain demand.\n\nFedEx Corp (FDX.N) told Reuters it was starting to see a slow pick-up in demand and that it was in discussions with many local governments as there were different restrictions in different cities.\n\nThe magnitude of the challenges presented by the new coronavirus crisis is much greater than SARS in the early 2000s, said Karen Reddington, president of FedEx Express Asia Pacific.\n\n“China is so much more connected, the fact that China now represents so much of the world’s economy I think that’s why, it seems so much more impactful at this time,” she said.\n\nMathieu Montelon, general manager of France’s Bigben Interactive, which makes smartphone accessories in the southeast province of Guangdong, said the disruptions underscored the complexity of inter-connected supply chains.\n\n“Even when the factory is in a position to open and take orders, their subcontractors might have issue with other local authorities, so they cannot open, or they don’t have the workers,” he said.\n\nHe added that Bigben is switching up the mix of products it offers retailers, pushing goods made in other countries less affected by the virus.\n\nOthers are looking at more drastic action, accelerating a broader shift of production out of China that took off with the trade war.\n\nAnjoran, the operator of the factory in Dongguan, is considering setting up a second assembly center in Mexico to serve U.S. customers with minimal reliance on China.\n\n“People are seeing China as a major source of risk,” he said."

The New England Regional Council of Carpenters started the bank in 1987, and the institution was long known as First Trade Union Bank.

On artificial intelligence, users and developers of AI systems used in high-risk fields, such as health, policing, or transportation, would face legal requirements, including tests by authorities, which could also certify the data used by algorithms, the Commission said. High-risk AI could also face sanctions, while lower-risk applications should abide by a voluntary labeling program, the body said. — BLOOMBERG NEWS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nBuilding of new homes up a bit in January\n\nConstruction of new homes edged back slightly in January after a December surge that had pushed home construction to the highest level in 13 years.

Clyburn demurred.\n\n“Don’t you think that is something that is constructive?” Cavuto asked.\n\n“Come on, Neil, because it is not true … I’m saying that the African American unemployment is not the lowest it has ever been unless you count slavery. We were fully employed during slavery. It all depends on how you measure this up,” he said.

Remember, I was there. I was part of the leadership. I was around that table every day … That is what we did back in 2009,” the congressman said.\n\nClyburn continued by insisting Obama put all the elements in place for a prosperous economy and Trump has merely maintained a holding pattern, saying the economy is no different today than when the president took office in 2017.

            "content": "When he became chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai announced that he was going to take a “weed whacker” to Obama-era regulations. So far, he’s kept his promise, and earned the internet’s ire for reversing the agency’s position on net neutrality. Pai defends his actions and explains how the U.S. can “win” everything from the 5G race to the war on robocalls.\n\nListen and subscribe to our podcast at Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or elsewhere. Below is a transcript of the episode, edited for readability. For more information on the people and ideas in the episode, see the links at the bottom of this post.\n\n* * *\n\nStephen DUBNER: Now, when you first joined the F.C.C. back in 2007 I believe, a profile of you described the F.C.C. as “one of those government institutions that conceals its importance behind an impenetrable veneer of boring-ness.” I’m curious whether you think that’s about accurate? Ajit PAI: I think the description might have described the agency for some time, but given the range of our jurisdiction today, I think it’s assumed much more prominence.\n\nI’d like you to meet Ajit Pai.\n\nPAI: I serve as the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe F.C.C., an independent government agency overseen by Congress, was founded in 1934. Its baseline mission is to regulate communications by radio, TV, wire, satellite, and cable. Because communications technology has evolved just a little bit since 1934, the agency’s portfolio has evolved as well. Not just in size but in complexity. Its decisions carry not only economic ramifications but, increasingly, societal, security, and political ramifications too. Consider the agency’s recent effort — led by Ajit Pai — to reverse the commission’s own position on net neutrality:\n\nPBS NewsHour: A political fight is brewing about access to the internet. PAI: It involves a basic concept of how the internet is governed. Do you want it to be governed by engineers and entrepreneurs? Or do you want it to be run by bureaucrats and lawyers here in Washington? Tom WHEELER: To go out and claim that somehow this is some kind of consumer protection is a fraudulent representation.\n\nThe net-neutrality fight — with all its scintillating debate about the Title I and Title II sections of the Communications Act of 1934 — led to Ajit Pai being called “the most hated man on the internet.” Among a certain cohort at least, that wasn’t much of an exaggeration. Pai is not afraid to take a strong stance, or defend it. And these days, there are plenty of strong stances to take. On issues that the public doesn’t much care about — like spectrum allocation and small-cell deployment. But also on robocalls, the 5G rollout, and what to do about Huawei.\n\nPAI: I do think that both existing and prospective equipment from that company presents an unacceptable risk to the American consumer.\n\nToday on Freakonomics Radio: what the F.C.C. can, can’t, and won’t do — and why you should care.\n\n* * *\n\nI wish it were necessary to preface the following bits of tape with an explanation but it’s not. Without any explanation, you will know exactly what you’re hearing:\n\nRobocall 1: This is Molly from Apple Support. We have found some suspicious activity on your iCloud account. Robocall 2: Hi, this is Josh, from the customer service department. Chinese Robocall: [Speaking Chinese.]\n\nLast year, American phone numbers received a record 26.3 billion robocalls.\n\nRobocall 3: The reason of this call is to inform you that I.R.S. is filing a lawsuit against you.\n\nThat’s roughly 80 calls per man, woman, and child.\n\nRobocall 4: We are conducting scientific research. Please take a moment to answer.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I’ve gotten way more than my share. So, I asked Ajit Pai, how many robocalls should one person be required to absorb?\n\nPAI: I’m not sure what the number is, but whatever calls you’re not getting, I seem to be getting them myself, so I share that frustration. And that’s why we’ve made it our top consumer-protection priority to attack this problem. And I know that the progress has not been apparent to some, but we are taking serious steps to mitigate this problem. DUBNER: I know the TRACED Act was recently signed into law. Can you give us a quick overview of that? PAI: Yes. This is bipartisan legislation that just passed each house of Congress, that the president signed, that, among other things, extends the statute of limitations for the F.C.C. to go after the bad guys, the robocallers themselves. It also gives the F.C.C. clear authority to require phone providers to update their caller I.D. authentication framework. DUBNER: So those sound like a lot of laws that are written and then not enforced. How is that enforceable? PAI: I can tell you that we have already gone to work enforcing it. I directed my staff, even before the TRACED Act was signed, to draft regulations forcing phone companies to adopt by this caller I.D. authentication framework. In terms of enforcement, I’ve already talked to our enforcement team to say, “Look, we now have an extended statute of limitations. Let’s go after the bad guys, even those who committed these violations two or three years ago, beyond the previous statute of limitations, and make sure that the consumer interest is vindicated here.” DUBNER: So a lot of people are getting rid of landline phones for a variety of reasons, one of which is to avoid robocalls. It strikes me as a strange and rather poor outcome of an unintended consequence for these phone companies that have not policed it very well, that they’re potentially losing revenue because of a service that they let thrive on their network. Do you think they will recapture that money elsewise? PAI: That’s a good question. And I’ve consistently said that as well, that in the long run, this undermines public confidence in the entire phone system. And many of them have embraced this caller I.D. authentication framework. They’re starting to develop analytics that can detect what is a robocall and what is not. We’ve now made clear that they can block robocalls by default if they use those analytical tools. So I think they have come to recognize that it’s not just bad for consumers, it’s also bad for business.\n\nIf you had to characterize Ajit Pai’s general philosophy as a regulator, you might say it occupies that very fine line between what’s bad for consumers and what’s bad for business. His critics — primarily Democrats and net-neutrality advocates — argue that he too often sides with business, even while signaling that he cares deeply about consumers. Pai was a Democrat before he was a Republican; the switch came during college, at Harvard, where he was taken with the free-market economic stylings of Martin Feldstein. He went on to law school at the University of Chicago. Pai’s parents, both doctors, were initially disappointed that he chose law over medicine — but they’ve since come around. Ajit was born in Buffalo, New York, and grew up in Kansas. His parents had moved to the U.S. from India; they also lived in Canada for a few years. In a 2014 interview, Pai said: “One of the reasons why they wanted to come back to the United States is because they saw that the Canadian marketplace for doctors was highly regulated,” with “much less opportunity for them to be doctors, and entrepreneurial.”\n\nAjit Pai, as a lawyer, has held several government jobs as well as a few in the private sector. On the government side: he clerked for U.S. District Court Justice Martin Feldman; he worked at the Department of Justice, including the antitrust division; and in the general counsel’s office of the F.C.C.; he was also a legal counsel for the Supreme Court nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito. On the private side: Pai worked for a couple years at Verizon and, after that earlier F.C.C. term, he worked in the communications practice of the law firm Jenner & Block. In 2012, he returned to the F.C.C. as one of its five commissioners when a Republican seat opened up. The way it works is that three of the agency’s commissioners come from the party of the sitting president, the other two from the minority party. The chairman — who’s one of the five commissioners — comes from the president’s party. When Pai joined, Barack Obama was president, and the F.C.C. chair was Tom Wheeler. From the start, Pai embraced a more free-market approach to regulation, and voted against many of Wheeler’s proposals — having to do with corporate mergers, for instance, and media-ownership rules. Most significantly, Pai opposed the F.C.C.’s 2015 ruling on net neutrality. In 2017, with the Republican Donald Trump having been elected president, Ajit Pai became the F.C.C.’s chairman.\n\nDUBNER: When you took over as chair, you said you wanted to, “fire up the weed-whacker” and get rid of a bunch of regulatory underbrush that was created primarily during the Obama administration. Okay, so tell us, let’s say, three things that you’ve taken out or at least mitigated against, with the weed-whacker. PAI: One that I think would resonate with many consumers is in encouraging telephone companies to stop focusing their investments on the copper networks that are fading in the ground and focus those investments on fiber. Under some of the previous rules that were in place, these companies had to maintain those copper networks no matter what, even though these networks were not providing consumers high-capacity, high-quality broadband. And I have yet to meet a consumer who says, yep, we don’t need high-capacity fiber. Another example would involve streamlining the process for deploying wireless infrastructure. Many might not appreciate it, but we have not just federal regulatory review, but state regulatory review, local review, as well as review by any one of the 573 federally-recognized Indian tribes. And so if you’re looking to put up a single wireless antenna, you have to jump through a lot of different regulatory hoops. And what we’ve tried to do is streamline that. On the broadcast side, the third example I would offer — this is very arcane, I realize — but it was a regulation nonetheless — that broadcast stations had to maintain a hard copy of their license of the F.C.C.’s rules, even though all of this is readily available online. And so we’ve been converting to online information.\n\nPai’s weed-whacking has of course not been universally celebrated. One of the F.C.C.’s Democratic commissioners, Jessica Rosenworcel, argued that consumers would be hurt if phone companies shut down copper-wire networks without providing an alternative. As for streamlining wireless infrastructure: the F.C.C.’s attempt to let providers bypass environmental and historic-preservation reviews was rejected on appeal, with the court calling the proposed changes “arbitrary and capricious.” But Pai’s most contentious piece of weed-whacking by far was his repeal of the F.C.C.’s own 2015 ruling on net neutrality.\n\nThe term net neutrality was popularized back in 2002 by the lawyer and internet scholar Tim Wu. Its most basic, common meaning is that everything on the internet should be treated neutrally by Internet service providers, or I.S.P.’s, like Verizon and T-Mobile — that there shouldn’t be “fast lanes” for companies or consumers who want to pay more. Tim Wu summed up the issue with two questions: “How should a network’s owner treat the traffic that it carries?” And, “What rights, if any, should a network’s users have versus its owners?” Ajit Pai tends to frame the issue differently, from the technical perspective of how the F.C.C. does its regulatory job.\n\nPAI: I think it is fair to say that net neutrality involves the basic question of how do you want the government to regulate the Internet? Do you want it to regulate it on a more market-based framework, allowing it to develop organically and taking targeted action against any competitive conduct through competition laws administered by the F.T.C. and the Department of Justice? Or do you want to regulate it as a utility, applying what is known as Title II of the Communications Act, which essentially treats any internet provider as Ma Bell was regulated back in 1934. And it’s essentially a choice between those two different models. DUBNER: So your decision to repeal the F.C.C.’s earlier position on net neutrality — basically opening things up, as you characterized it, or at least exposing it more to the market — your position was met with intense blowback. PAI: So I hear, yes. DUBNER: So some of it on the merits, from legal and Internet scholars and others. And then some from people who were sending death threats to you, your family, your young children. I’d like you to describe the period from your perspective. First, the decision to repeal, and then whether the response took you off guard. PAI: Sure. So I was a commissioner prior to 2017, when the 2015 F.C.C. imposed these utility-style regulations. And at the time I said, look, the Internet economy in the United States isn’t broken. The last thing we need is utility-style regulation that was developed in 1934 to address the 21st-century digital economy. And over my dissent, the F.C.C. made that decision. So in 2017, when I became chairman, I said, let’s take a fresh look at this. We teed up a proposal to remove those regulations. And then in December of 2017, made the decision to ultimately repeal those regulations, but institute a much stronger transparency rule. And at the time, we thought this is the right thing for the Internet economy and that we hoped that people would approach the table to debate this in good faith. Of course, as you mentioned, much of the “debate” strayed far more into the level of vitriol and even personal threats and the like. I wasn’t surprised that the decision raised consternation in some quarters. But I was struck at how vicious some of the blowback was. It certainly affected my family, my parents, my in-laws, friends and the like. And that was distressing, because I think the one thing that has distinguished American democracy, generally speaking, is that we can disagree, but at the end of the day, approach each other with civility and respect. And that is certainly not something that I found among many who entered the public square on this debate. DUBNER: So you’ve discussed the — what you called — heavy-handed regulation, that ultimately your opponents proposed. But I’m curious if you could be specific on what kind of regulations you felt were so encroaching. So, for instance, as I understand it, the F.C.C. actually used forbearance to say that a lot of the Title II regulations would not apply to I.S.P.’s, like rate regulation and universal service contributions. In fact, fewer regulations would apply to I.S.P.’s than to mobile-phone providers. So what did you feel we were actually missing out on? Because the argument against is that you were enabling big firms to get bigger, get more profitable, at the expense of certain users and certain smaller providers. PAI: Sure, so, two things in particular. No. 1, the Title II classification of broadband comes with a whole host of subsidiary regulations. Under Title II, as you implied, there are a bunch of different rules that would apply to a common carrier, as it is called. It is true that the F.C.C. previously decided to forbear from the enforcement of some of those regulations, but others still remained. And moreover, what I heard from many Internet service providers in our record was that when they went to a bank and said, “Look, we want to raise capital in order to build a broadband network,” many of the banks would say, “Well, yes, even though the F.C.C. has forborn for now from some of those Title II regulations, they may not forbear in the future.” And in fact, if you look at the 2015 F.C.C. order, it says repeatedly, we are forbearing for now. And I think that uncertainty created a lot of doubts among those who require capital expenditures to build these networks. The second thing is, the uncertainty created by the general conduct standard. This was a catch-all that the F.C.C. threw in to that 2015 order. Any network management practice, any business practice whatsoever, could be prohibited by the F.C.C. And in fact, the very first invocation of that authority was to go after wireless companies, smaller ones in particular, that were offering consumers free data through things called zero-rating, to allow the services to be delivered for free. And to me, that just spoke to the fact that the F.C.C. was arrogating to itself a lot more authority to address problems that hadn’t even materialized yet. And that was a problem for consumers and for companies alike.\n\nZero-rating, by the way, is a sort of loophole that allows internet providers to designate certain websites as counting for zero toward a customer’s data usage. T-Mobile, for instance, had a program called Binge On that let customers stream Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu without that counting toward their data-usage ceiling. You can see why, in net-neutrality terms, this would worry some people, since it favors the sites that have struck deals with a given I.S.P. The F.C.C.’s 2015 net-neutrality order didn’t definitively ban or allow these practices, however; it merely said that it could consider them on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn any case, Pai’s repeal of the net-neutrality order officially went into action in 2018. But the whole thing is still a bit up in the air. A group of tech companies and consumer-advocacy groups, led by Mozilla, sued the F.C.C. for overreach. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the F.C.C. had not overreached, but it did agree with the plaintiffs that states should be allowed to enact their own net-neutrality laws. It also said the F.C.C. needed to address how certain sectors, like public-safety workers, would be affected by the changes. While the opponents of net neutrality may have a certain amount of self-interest at stake, the general accusation is even more obvious: that the F.C.C. is helping the rich get richer, the powerful gain more power, and causing the digital concentration among giants like Facebook and Google and Amazon to become even more concentrated.\n\nDUBNER: So let’s imagine we are talking in 2030 and not 2020, and looking back on 2020. What did people misunderstand about net neutrality? PAI: Oh, boy. By 2030, I would argue that we will view this problem in the rearview mirror as a quaint anachronism. I honestly believe that, because I think we are going to see in the next 10 years an explosion in terms of modes of connectivity. Just over the last three years, under my leadership, for example, we’ve been pushing out a lot of spectrum for 5G and we could anticipate in ten years that the wireless connections will serve, at least in urban areas, as a complete substitute for some of the fixed broadband that we see. Moreover, we’re seeing a lot more innovation in space. Even now, companies like SpaceX and OneWeb are launching satellites in low-earth orbit. And I think they’re going to provide a competitive alternative. So once you see all of this innovation in ten years, I think the question of having a regulator in Washington sit there and micromanage all kinds of network and business practices will seem odd. DUBNER: So a group of prominent states have sued to block the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, even though your F.C.C. and the Justice Department have okayed the deal. So this case, as we speak, is in court, should be decided very soon. Will your side win? And why or why not? PAI: I can’t guess about the outcome of this litigation, unfortunately, haven’t read the briefs, haven’t watched the witnesses. I certainly hope we will prevail, and that the partisan minority of state attorneys general who are pursuing this misguided litigation will lose. And the reason I say that is not just because of the institutional interests that the F.C.C. and the D.O.J. represent, the interests of the entire country and of competition across the country. And also because at the end of the day, we have our eyes on the future. And the future is going to be 5G. And I don’t believe — and I don’t think my colleague at the Department of Justice believes — that two standalone competitors in this particular transaction would be as strong as a combined competitor. 5G networks will require a lot of capital to build the small-cell infrastructure of the future. It will require even more capital to bid at auction, on spectrum. And in addition to that, the different companies have different spectrum assets today that are not worth as much separate as they are together. And so looking forward, if the merger were to fall apart for whatever reason, I don’t think consumers would be better off.\n\nAs it happened, the merger didn’t fall apart. We did this interview with Pai in January; and in February, the T-Mobile-Sprint merger was approved.\n\nDUBNER: So, cell phone plans in the U.S. are much more expensive than in Europe. Some economists argue that’s because U.S. corporations have successfully captured government via lobbying. Wouldn’t a merger like this just make it worse? PAI: I don’t believe so. And in part that’s because then we would lose a lot of the benefits of the transaction. For example, Sprint right now is not investing significantly in maintaining its network. And that would only continue in the future. In addition to that, the Department of Justice and the F.C.C. are looking at creating Dish as a fourth wireless competitor. Essentially Boost Mobile, which is a Sprint brand, would be divested to Dish. And Dish would also have a network agreement with T-Mobile that would allow them to compete. And all of that goes away. In addition to that, I’d be remiss if I didn’t add that one commitment that the F.C.C. got from these parties — was to deploy 5G, which is defined as 50 megabits per second or greater — to 97 percent of American consumers within three years and 99 percent of the American population within six years. The company is not going to make those investments to reach those targets if the deal doesn’t happen. And so I think at the end of the day, that’s a pretty big benefit. DUBNER: And if that 97 percent penetration doesn’t happen, what’s the penalty and how is it enforceable? PAI: There are billions of dollars in penalties that would attach at various time stages, and the F.C.C. has made clear in our decision that we would take aggressive steps to make sure that those conditions were enforced. DUBNER: More than twenty years ago, I guess, you worked in the Justice Department’s antitrust division, which at the time sued to block the merger of Sprint and WorldCom. And the merger was ultimately dropped. So, why were you against that merger and in favor of this one? PAI: So, I did work on the WorldCom/Sprint merger back then, and the thinking was that in some of those markets — in particular, if I remember correctly, the long-distance market — the fear was that WorldCom and Sprint would have an undue market share. And it’s been some time since I worked on the deal. So I can’t remember all the specifics. But looking forward now, I think it’s pretty clear that the market changes very, very quickly. I keep on my desk some articles from way back then about how— back in 2001, for example, that demanding the Federal Trade Commission take aggressive action to block the merger of Time Warner and A.O.L. because that company would have an unbreakable monopoly on instant messaging. Another article from 2007 talking about how MySpace had an unbreakable monopoly in terms of social networking. And I think if there’s one lesson in the telecom and tech sectors, it’s that things are very, very dynamic. And I think it’s a mistake for regulators to have a static view of the market in a moment in time, because that snapshot very quickly becomes yellowed with age. DUBNER: Economists notoriously argue, generally, in favor of free markets and competition, as you’re doing now, except in cases where certain participants may have market power, which results in an imperfect competitive market. Don’t you think that companies — whether we’re talking broadband, mobile, whatever, AT&T, Verizon — don’t you think they have market power? And again, the evidence of price, cost, in the U.S. being so much higher than in Europe. Don’t you think that seems to be conspiring against the consumer, at least on the price level? PAI: I think if you look at the wireless marketplace in particular, that’s good evidence that that is not the case. For example, there are four national carriers — AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint. In addition to that, there are a lot of regional carriers that provide wireless service. In addition to that, cable companies are now entering the marketplace with very aggressive offerings. Hundreds of thousands of subs for one cable company alone just last year. In addition to that, we have new companies entering this space offering services. So in terms of competition, I think the story is that things are getting better in terms of competitive entry and the like. Price is always a factor, which is why we are looking at encouraging some of this competitive entry, and we’re freeing up a ton more spectrum for people to acquire to be able to deploy these networks. But these are high CapEx industries. It’s not easy to build a wireless network. And that’s one of the challenges that any business has in this space.\n\nIt is of course not uncommon for lawyers to change their position based on who’s employing them. And if they’re skillful enough, they can make each position sound like the right one. I asked Pai to tell me one thing he believed for a long time to be true before changing his mind.\n\nPAI: I think one of the things that I have changed my mind about in recent years is, even though I’m a free marketer, the need for the government to get involved, sometimes in a significant way, to be able to vindicate the public interest. Upgrading the 9-1-1 system, for example. I mean, it’s something that the F.C.C. has to lead on. And I was the one who led the charge to get rid of the access codes — to have to dial a nine or an eight before reaching the outside line. Very simple problem to solve, but no individual company has a strong incentive to solve it. Same thing in terms of Wi-Fi spectrum. It’s very important for consumers, delivers a lot of value. But unless the F.C.C. steps in and says, “No, we’re going to create a space for innovation, we’re not going to auction the spectrum off in the market, that’s something that won’t happen.”\n\n* * *\n\nWe’re speaking today with Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. One of his biggest areas of interest at the moment is the rollout of what is called 5G. So what is 5G exactly, and why’s it so important?\n\nPAI: 5G is the next generation in wireless connectivity. The predecessor technology, of course, 4G LTE, is the one that many consumers with a smartphone will recognize. And 5G networks will be 100 times faster, perhaps more, than 4G networks. They’ll also be a lot more responsive. So for example, when you click on a link on your phone, you might notice there’s some lag time to get a response back from the network. That lag time is called latency. And 5G networks will have much less latency than 4G networks. Also, it will use a variety of different spectrum and that will allow not just better coverage, but also huge transmission of data, gigabits of data wirelessly.\n\nA reliable 5G network will require a massively expensive physical buildout, tremendous amounts of electrical power, and a significant amount of what’s called “harmonized mobile spectrum.” Spectrum— the radio frequencies that wireless signals travel through — is a limited resource. In the U.S., it belongs to the government, with some frequencies reserved for use by federal agencies.\n\nPAI: Typically, it is the Department of Defense, N.A.S.A., N.O.A.A., the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy.\n\nThose parts of the spectrum are overseen by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The F.C.C. oversees the rest of the frequencies, what’s called the commercial spectrum.\n\nPAI: And so when we’re trying to free up more spectrum for consumers, it’s very difficult to do if other agencies hold it, essentially. And that’s something that other countries have not done, they’ve given their F.C.C.’s the chance to regulate those airwaves directly. DUBNER: One might argue the spectrum is a natural resource, right, that should essentially be a social resource. But it’s been mostly treated as an avenue for commercial firms to distribute their products. What do you see as, I guess, the highest and best use of the spectrum, how to balance between commercial firms, the public, shareholders, and consumers? PAI: That is an excellent question, and one that has consumed the F.C.C. for many, many years. And for many years, the conventional wisdom was that the chairman of the F.C.C. or a majority of the F.C.C. should decide what those highest and most valued uses were. And so we picked winners and losers. But thanks in part to a very seminal paper by Ronald Coase, the famed Nobel Prize-winning economist, back in 1959, he pioneered the thought of auctioning off the spectrum, which is something that Congress allowed us to do starting in 1993. And over the last several years, we’ve embraced what is called flexible use. We auction off spectrum without any serious restrictions on how companies can use it, thinking that ultimately the private sector will determine the highest valued use.\n\nRight now, the highest-valued use appears to be the rollout of 5G. It has become a national priority, starting in the White House:\n\nDonald TRUMP: The race to 5G is a race America must win, and it’s a race, frankly, that our great companies are now involved in, we’ve given them the incentive they need. It’s a race that we will win.\n\nI asked Ajit Pai how much this desire to “win” the 5G race is driven by a broader competition with China, which appears to be significantly ahead with 5G.\n\nPAI: For me, at least, speaking on behalf of the agency, what I can say is that we believe it’s a national priority, not just for that reason, but also because we do think that 5G will transform many different sectors of our economy for the benefit of American consumers. And I do think that, given the experience with 4G, where American leadership in 4G, among other things, created the mobile-app economy that we all know and love today, and also made consumers much better off, we want them to benefit from 5G as well. So there’s certainly a geopolitical component to our thinking, but there’s also one of just the ability to deliver value for the American consumer. DUBNER: Can you talk for a moment about what you see specifically as the value provided? We hear about simultaneous translation. We talk about better virtual medical care. Maybe there’s a way to reverse every robocall and destroy the caller’s equipment. That would be lovely. But could you just kind of imagine for us maybe three to ten years from now, what a day in the life might be like for the average American communicator, and what 5G will make possible along those lines? PAI: In the early days of 5G, I would expect that enterprises, companies, will see more of the concrete services deployed. For example, if you own a warehouse and you want to manage how different packages or equipment is moving throughout the warehouse, you might use a 5G network to track that. But I certainly think that there are going to be consumer-friendly applications as well. For example, virtual and augmented reality. Gaming, of course, is one of the great services that people enjoy today. And I would imagine that using A.R. and V.R. based on 5G, that gaming is really going to take off. Same thing with things like telemedicine. There are some medical services that can’t be provided in a patient’s hometown. With a 5G connection, a doctor that might be 100 or even 1,000 miles away can get a high-resolution view of a patient’s dermatological problem, for example. DUBNER: So some critics suggest that this speed and intensity of communication with 5G may be coming at the expense of cybersecurity. Can you briefly, first, just give us an overview of how you’re considering balancing security with that speed or intensity? PAI: Those who voice those concerns are absolutely right to have a focus on security. The fact that we are going to have all kinds of new devices connected to the network — forget about phones, cars and refrigerators and the like — means not just more connected devices. It also means, as the cybersecurity experts would say, a greater attack surface. There are many more points at which a bad actor can target the network through some of these devices. Both here and across the world, I’ve been meeting with some of my counterparts and other private-sector leaders to emphasize that the future of 5G has to be not just strong networks, but also secure networks. And I think the common thread is that people are very excited about the future of communications networks, but also concerned about the fact that we are, in some cases, as vulnerable as our most vulnerable part of the network. So much more work to be done on that front, both here and abroad.\n\nLast year, Pai put forth an F.C.C. proposal that would prohibit F.C.C. funds from being used to buy equipment from companies that pose “a national security threat.” This proposal singled out Huawei and Z.T.E., two of China’s biggest telecommunications companies. The proposed ban has since been unanimously approved by the F.C.C., although Huawei has been trying to challenge it in court.\n\nDUBNER: Can you talk for a moment about Huawei, especially Huawei equipment, that was being installed widely, as I understand it, in rural communities, in part because it was cheaper than American-made, and what you, and I guess, Congress, have been doing to change that? PAI: Yeah, so this company and other Chinese companies in particular have presented special concerns. And one part of the F.C.C.’s decision last year involved getting a survey from these rural companies about what Huawei equipment they might have in their networks, and equipment from Z.T.E., and figuring out the costs of removing that equipment from the network. And we are taking that step because we do think that these Chinese companies in particular present a risk. Any Chinese company is subject to China’s national intelligence law. One article of that law requires Huawei and Z.T.E., any company subject to Chinese jurisdiction, to comply with requests from the intelligence services. Another article of that law prohibits any recipient of such a request from disclosing it to their customers. And I think, given the Chinese government’s recent actions on everything from Taiwanese flag emojis on Apple iPhones manufactured in Hong Kong, to N.B.A. stars voicing opinions about Hong Kong, to the use of facial-recognition technology in Xinjiang and others, I think it’s very clear that the Chinese Communist Party is more than happy to promulgate such requests, and that is not a risk, I don’t think, that the American consumer or the American government should take. DUBNER: Did you see any evidence that Huawei equipment on U.S. networks had allowed any kind of security breach? PAI: There obviously are classified restrictions on my ability to discuss some of that information. DUBNER: It’s just us talking here. It’s okay. PAI: Right. So unfortunately, I can’t reveal some of what we’ve learned in intelligence briefings. But what I will say is that I do think that both existing and prospective equipment from that company presents an unacceptable risk to the American consumer, especially when you think about some of the government installations that the Chinese would love to know more about. DUBNER: And I understand that Congress approved something in the neighborhood of $1 billion to buy off or buy out this Huawei equipment or to subsidize the installation of American-made or other equipment in these rural areas. Is that true? PAI: Congress is currently considering legislation that would do that. We don’t have funding on our own. And so I’ve asked Congress to take a look at giving us — or deriving directly to these companies — a funding stream to allow them to remove this equipment. DUBNER: Another cybersecurity question, looking forward a little bit more. So, as I understand it — and I may be wrong, please correct me if I am — the rise in quantum computing could really destroy what’s now considered secure communication. And again, as I understand it, the Chinese and perhaps others are warehousing our currently-encrypted data communications in order to break it later when that’s viable. Tell us what you know about this. And if what I’ve said is accurate, what’s being done about it? PAI: I have read a decent amount about quantum computing and in particular about Chinese direct investments into quantum computing technologies. And I’m not an expert in this area, to say the least, but I have heard the concern that one of the killer apps, so to speak, of quantum would be the ability to break encrypted communications. And so especially to the extent that the Chinese have data sets that they have acquired through pilfering or through other means, that is something that would concern me. And I say that as somebody who, as an applicant for a federal job, has had his SF-86 form, I’m sure, sitting in some People’s Liberation Army warehouse somewhere to be analyzed later. DUBNER: What’s on that form? PAI: So this back in 2015, during the Obama administration, you might have seen that the SF-86 for any applicant for a federal job for many years, including the personal information of their family members and friends, etc., who are listed on those forms, was taken en masse from the Office of Personnel Management. And the speculation was that the People’s Liberation Army of China managed this hack and that the hacked information — was now sitting on servers somewhere in China to be analyzed. And you think about all of the people across the government, U.S. government, who that involves. That is a major data breach, to say the least. I was worried about it when it happened five years ago, and I remain worried about it today. DUBNER: So a lot of conversations about foreign governments interfering with the U.S. strike me at least as a little bit naive, as if the U.S. has never interfered with foreign governments in any way, politically, whatnot. Because if you read even a little bit of history, you know that’s the case. So let me ask you this. Let’s assume that the Chinese government, Russian government, maybe others, are warehousing whatever data they can from American or international communication with the hopes that quantum computing will allow them to break those encryptions later. What about us? PAI: Well, so what I would say to that is obviously each country has an intelligence service and they pursue activities that those countries believe is in their national interest. But I think there is a distinction between those traditional techniques of intelligence gathering and analysis and what we see from the Chinese Communist Party, from the Russian government, and others. I have put out on my Twitter account, for example, a long-running series of practices by the Chinese Communist Party that combine not just the ability to conduct some of the intelligence activities with what I believe is a malign intent, either to use those technologies to harm their own people, but also to compromise and to steal, in many cases, technologies from other countries. For example, last year, the Department of Justice announced an indictment of certain company officials from Huawei. Huawei officials stole a bunch of sensitive information from T-Mobile, one of our biggest carriers, gave them incentives to steal. Those are the types of things we’re talking about here at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party. And I think, to be honest, we’re dealing with a different kind of threat in this case, from some of the other typical activities we’ve seen. DUBNER: So I’ve heard you say that the F.C.C. is determinedly not in the business of content regulation. So all of these pipelines and airwaves and so on carry obviously a lot of content that a lot of people consume in a lot of different ways. But that’s not what you do. Now, when I hear you say that, I think, well, there are issues today in the media that — many of which didn’t exist back in 1934. Everything from truly fake news to bot-driven media to foreign interference. So why don’t you see a role for government, especially the F.C.C., in addressing or regulating that? PAI: Part of the reason is legal. Under the Constitution, the First Amendment, of course. And the current laws in the Communications Act and other laws that Congress has given us to administer. I don’t see that we have the legal authority to get involved in this space. And secondly, as a policy matter, it becomes very difficult quickly, as you realize, to draw the lines here. What constitutes a permissible view and what does not? And that difficulty in drawing lines, I think, would make it, as a practical matter, almost impossible for any agency, especially the F.C.C., to make a determination here. DUBNER: I appreciate that position. But I’ve also heard you say publicly that firms like Google and Facebook offer no transparency about how their products are put together. Right? And these are publicly held firms. And then they’re largely left to police themselves until or when someone discovers that an algorithm has essentially cheated someone in some fashion. So could you see the F.C.C. getting involved at some point, at least on the transparency end of things? PAI: Well, so I would distinguish between transparency and content regulation. I think transparency is something that every consumer would expect of any company to disclose how it’s doing business. We don’t have jurisdiction over tech firms as such. I’ve spoken with my counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission who does have jurisdiction over them about the importance of transparency. But certainly with respect to broadband providers, we’ve instituted a very strong transparency rule that requires any Internet service provider to disclose its network management practices, its consumer service plans, and the like, so that consumers can make informed decisions upfront. I think that is a happy medium between the content regulation that some want and a complete free-for-all where these companies are unregulated whatsoever. DUBNER: Predicting the future is obviously hard, if not impossible. But if you had to guess what problems your successors will be dealing with — let’s say an F.C.C. chair 10 or even 20 years from now — what do you anticipate being their cutting-edge priorities? PAI: Boy, if I had to look forward 10 years, assuming some of the problems we’ve talked about thus far have been solved — I tend to be an eternal optimist — I do think that one of the things we’ll have to think about going forward ten years from now, when I would forecast that the Chinese in particular will be much more prominent in the technology spaces, do we continue to believe in the success of our model? Traditionally, the U.S. government has not directly funded technology. We haven’t picked national champions. We don’t subsidize them when they’re bidding on contracts abroad. We don’t violate trade rules. We’ve essentially had a free-market approach. And I think it’s the right one. But I think 10 years from now, my successors are going to face a pretty basic challenge when it comes to things like spectrum auctions or the allocation of funding through our universal service fund. Is it better, vis-a-vis the Chinese, for example, to have a more unified industrial policy? I don’t think so currently, to be clear, but I do think that’s something that’s going to gain a lot more currency in the time to come. DUBNER: So the F.C.C. recently auctioned off some spectrum for 5G use. I believe you took in a little bit more than $6 billion. Where does that auction money go? PAI: So by law, we are required to deposit any auction proceeds into the U.S. Treasury. We don’t keep it for ourselves or remit it to Congress. DUBNER: And it just goes into a — I don’t mean to— the phrase that comes to mind is “slush fund.” I didn’t mean to use it pejoratively, but it goes into a general fund? It’s not directed toward any kind of communication or technology use? PAI: That is correct. It is dedicated to the Treasury, which uses it typically for deficit reduction. But I actually proposed many years ago, in 2016, that the Congress give us authority to reserve ten percent or some percentage of the proceeds to devote to rural broadband deployment, which is something that’s important to me and obviously important to many Americans. DUBNER: Considering that your agency gets to auction off the spectrum, which— let’s call it a natural resource — but then diverts that money back to Treasury, it does make you think about other natural resources like oil, which is— obviously the government gets some revenue from licensing, but most of that money is captured by private firms and their shareholders. Does your position with the spectrum make you rethink, if we were to rewind the clock back to 150 years ago, before oil was a big commodity in the U.S., how you might apportion that revenue differently? PAI: That’s an excellent question. I do think that our experience with spectrum suggests a successful model, that we allow private-sector innovation to flourish and we get a return for the public fisc. Whether it’s applicable to oil or other natural resources, I can’t say. But I do think that by and large the consensus view is that the competitive bidding that Ronald Coase pioneered that we’ve been administering has been quite successful for all involved. DUBNER: So you have personally pinballed between government service and private practice for many years, including a stint at Verizon. Where should we expect to see Ajit Pai 10 years from now? Are you running a telecom? Are you running for president of the United States? What are you doing? PAI: Well, so just between us, since you promised me that no one else was listening — so about a year, two years ago, maybe, when I was in Los Angeles for some meetings, I had a chance to visit Judge Judy. And I told her, as I will tell you, that I think she presides over the highest court in the land, and should she ever choose to hang up her spurs, it would be an honor of a lifetime for me to don the robe. She humored me with a pleasant response. We’ll see if that pans out over the next decade. But other than that, and the Kansas City Chiefs losing their minds and signing a slow 47-year-old to be a wide receiver, I don’t really have any particular aspirations that I can share at this time.\n\n* * *\n\nFreakonomics Radio is produced by Stitcher and Dubner Productions.

Courtesy of Skylight\n\nTraditional brick-and-mortar shopping offers customers more than an opportunity to purchase—it’s a chance to have a personal interaction with a brand. From the unique way a brand merchandises items down to the lighting and design, music and employees, a brick-and-mortar store experience is just that: an experience. As customers continue to move towards a digital landscape, brands are exploring new ways to break through the digital noise and offer customers tactile, sensory, and personalized experiences—effectively turning built environments into ad space.\n\nLove, Bleecker Bonberi Store Installation. Brookfield Properties commissioned Skylight to reimagine ... [+] the historic West Village corridor. Courtesy of Skylight\n\nSimilarly, commercial real estate developers, architects, and investors are exploring new ways to reinvigorate historic, underused, or shuttered spaces that once served traditional brick-and-mortar purposes but struggle to remain robust in a digital economy. Brands and real estate developers alike are turning to firms like Skylight, a placemaking and venue development firm that combines adaptive reuse, redevelopment, and forecasting to transform traditional and struggling commercial spaces into immersive brand experiences.\n\nCreated by Skylight: Spotify's Billie Eilish Experience, which took place in ROW DTLA where produce ... [+] stalls were transformed into activations inspired by themes in Eilish's debut album. Kam Pashi\n\nSkylight specializes in developing “intentional short-term real estate opportunities” for brands—most often activations, pop-ups, and launch events. Conceptually, these opportunities are designed to reenergize an underutilized built space and give customers a tangible experience with a brand. Over the last decade, Skylight has developed brand experiences for such companies as Amazon, Hermes, Nike, Hulu, Spotify, and Tesla. Brick-and-mortar locations include The High Line, St John’s Terminal, the Historic San Francisco Mint, the Row in Los Angeles, and New York’s Bleeker Street corridor.\n\nSkylight designed the Virgil Abloh x Nike \"Off Campus\" activation at 23 Wall Street, NYC. Daniel Sims\n\nWe recently sat down with Stephanie Blake, CEO of Skylight, to learn more about the firm’s approach to brick-and-mortar and her thoughts on the ongoing push and pull between built commercial spaces and the digital economy.\n\nSkylight is known for creating what you refer to as “intentional short-term real estate opportunities.” What do you see as the benefits to this approach?\n\nSB: Intentional short-term real estate opportunities are the physical manifestation of the “drop” economy. It’s a disruption (and re-imagination) in both real estate and retail / brand approach to innovation and development.\n\nIt’s not replacing permanent brick-and-mortar concepts, but it is reimagining the industry in the way co-working companies changed the way we use office space and share ideas and resources to promote innovation...In a world where new collaboration, co-creation, and constant iteration is needed to maintain consumer interest, short term real estate plays provide the platform to showcase these moments while gathering intel and insights that inform the next move.\n\nSkylight worked with Nike to create their \"Off Campus\" experience at 23 Wall Street for Abloh's Off ... [+] White Nike collection. Daniel Sims\n\nFor example, Skylight worked with Nike and Virgil Abloh to find a home for their Nike “Off Campus” experience, which was created to showcase a collaboration between Nike and Off-White. Skylight brought the multi-day activation to 23 Wall Street, the former home of JP Morgan. The event, which included an immersive museum, programming, and a retail space, sold out almost immediately.\n\nShort-term real estate opportunities have allowed brands the short-term flexibility to take RISKS and EXPERIMENT with different concepts, based on the willingness to suffer losses if costs are significantly lower. Stephanie Blake, CEO, Skylight\n\nCan you talk about your statement that one of the biggest real estate trends for 2020 will be the utilization of the physical and built environment as ad space?\n\nSB: Storytelling is more important. The built environment provides something that screens cannot. There is a desire to reach consumers where they are with these stories, and brands are taking notice of the way audiences go about their daily routines, particularly in cities.\n\nThe physical and built environment can be utilized as ad space. At Google over a decade (15 years) ago, the focus used to be ‘how do we convince brands to move spend from traditional media to online?’ The pendulum is swinging back, but now with new tools informed by digital products and the growing importance of data.\n\nBrand communities, referring to any investment of time or money that customer makes into a brand beyond purchase/transaction (think Harley Davidson die hard fans getting tattoos of the brand + meeting with other fans) is the most valuable brand equity that brand aim to achieve. Skylight has followed this shift first hand through our event and client experiences; while brands historically spent marketing dollars on traditional product launches and showrooms, we are noticing a transformation to experiences that aim to form brand communities and bring fans together.\n\nSpotify's Billie Eilish Experience designed took place at ROW DTLA. Kam Pashi\n\nFor example, The Stalls at Skylight ROW DTLA hosted a sprawling, multi-sensory production in support of Billie Eilish’s debut album. The Billie Eilish Experience welcomed over 3,000 devoted fans for a weekend of art, technology, and the unexpected inspired by the artist’s own experiences with synesthesia. Conceived by Billie Eilish herself, and produced in partnership with Spotify and Adobe, the former produce stalls were transformed into immersive rooms imagined along the themes of the tracks on her album, “When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” This provided a tangible experience in which Billie could demonstrate her unique point of view as an artist, celebrate a career milestone, and give fans a platform for engagement and community in her home city.\n\nReebok And Gigi Hadid Present #PerfectNever Revolution at Clarkson Square in New York City. Courtesy of Skylight\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the future of traditional brick-and-mortar retail?\n\nSB: Cities were built around adjacencies—the pop-up economy responds to this by sharing space within communities and affinity groups...ALL brands need to consider a physical space, even e-commerce, direct-to-consumer brands still seek out brick-and- mortar opportunities to reach consumers.\n\nMulti-brand formats, and even store-in-store residencies that showcase a brand and its partners / collaborators embody the co-creation model where 1+1=4. There should be core pillars or elements that give the brand environment a specific messaging and point of view, or some defining element that differentiates the store from others in a very competitive retail landscape where it is more difficult to get customers in store.\n\nPrabal Gurung store installation at Love, Bleeker in New York City's Bleeker Street corridor. Courtesy of Skylight\n\nFor example, Skylight created an urban landscape at the intersection of art, commerce, and culture: Love, Bleecker, a collective of locally-based, digitally-native brands, each paired with contemporary artists.\n\nEleven new brands have joined the corridor since Skylight debuted the project, resulting in a 63% decrease in vacancy with brands that share audiences and similarities to Love, Bleecker’s tenants. Skylight created and ran a comprehensive programming calendar engaging the neighborhood residents and NYC locals, and fostered community amongst the merchants. Over 120 unique events filled the corridor, igniting community building and experiential retail.\n\nFleurotica store installation at Love, Bleeker. Courtesy of Skylight\n\nIt’s interesting that digital brands are embracing the built environment. What is driving that?\n\nSB: Digital saturation has spurred a movement toward IRL experiences for brand engagement with consumers, but it’s also informed the way that we approach them. Just as A/B testing is essential for innovation in the tech space, in-person interactions across a variety of markets, demographics, and formats / settings is crucial for companies to keep pace with breakneck changes in consumer preferences and behaviors."

The death toll rose by 108, down from 132 the previous day, bringing to total in China to over 2,100 deaths and 74,000 cases.\n\nThe new figures include subtracting 279 cases in the province that were not confirmed, a larger-than-usual number. No explanation was given. Excluding the deductions, the number of new cases on Wednesday stood at 628, still a large drop.\n\nChina is struggling to get its economy back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year.\n\nBeyond mainland China, six people have died from the disease, and governments around the world are trying to prevent it from spreading into a global pandemic.\n\nAustralia's Qantas Airways Ltd. said on Thursday it will ground the equivalent of 18 planes, freeze recruitment and ask its 30,000 staff to use up annual leave as it grapples with falling demand from Asia due to the epidemic.\n\nHeading home\n\nHundreds of passengers trundled off a cruise ship in Japan on Wednesday after being held on board in quarantine for more than two weeks, as criticism mounted of Japan's handling of the outbreak.\n\nCanadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Wednesday afternoon that 47 of the 256 Canadians on board the liner are infected.\n\nThe federal government has chartered a plane to airlift most of the healthy Canadian passengers back to Canada. It's expected to fly out of Japan on Thursday.\n\n\"The aircraft the government has chartered is currently in Tokyo. We will begin pre-flight screening and disembarkation tomorrow evening local time,\" Champagne told reporters in Ottawa.\n\nWATCH | Foreign affairs minister discusses bringing Canadians home:\n\nForeign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne says Canadians on board the quarantined \"Diamond Princess\" will be flown back to Canada tomorrow evening - but only those without symptoms will be allowed to board. 2:18\n\nThe passengers will first be taken to Trenton, Ont., where they will be assessed. They will then be transported to the NAV Canada Training Institute in Cornwall, Ont., for 14 more days of quarantine.\n\nFrom Wednesday, passengers who tested negative and showed no symptoms were free to leave. Around 500 were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with the rest of those eligible leaving over the next two days. Confirmed cases were to be sent to hospital, while those who shared cabins with infected passengers may still be kept on board.\n\nAround 180 Australian evacuees from the ship have already landed in Darwin. The passengers, who were confined to the ship in the port of Yokohama, will now begin a second 14-day quarantine period in a camp facility near the northern Australian city, Australian health officials said.\n\nAround half of the passengers and crew are Japanese, and are free to go home once cleared to leave. Other countries, including Canada, have said they will fly passengers home and quarantine them on arrival. The United States flew more than 300 passengers to air bases in California and Texas this week.\n\nWATCH | Passengers disembark cruise ship:\n\nHundreds of people began disembarking the Diamond Princess as criticism mounted over Japan's handling of the on-board outbreak. 0:58\n\nEven as passengers rolled their luggage off the Diamond Princess cruise liner, Japanese authorities announced 79 new cases had been discovered on board, bringing the total to at least 620, well over half of the known cases outside mainland China.\n\nThe Diamond Princess has been quarantined near Tokyo since Feb. 3, initially with about 3,700 people aboard. The rapid spread of the disease on board led to criticism of the Japanese authorities just months before Japan is due to host the Olympics.\n\n'Completely inadequate'\n\nInfectious disease specialist Kentaro Iwata of Japan's Kobe University Hospital, who volunteered to help aboard the ship, described the infection control effort as \"completely inadequate\" and said basic protocols had not been followed.\n\n\"There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship and there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as a professional. The bureaucrats were in charge of everything,\" he said in a YouTube video.\n\nHealth Minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan's efforts.\n\n\"Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases,\" Kato said in a report by state broadcaster NHK.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Japan's efforts \"may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship.\"\n\nClyde and Renee Smith, 80-year-old American cruise passengers hospitalized in Japan since testing positive for the virus on Feb. 3, learned on Wednesday they were still positive.\n\n\"We are very happy here,\" Clyde said from the couple's hospital room in western Tokyo. \"They're taking excellent care of us. This is the newest, fanciest hospital I've ever seen.\"\n\nFrom the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers were not confined to rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as passengers were being screened, events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class.\n\nScientists published on Wednesday preliminary findings in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested the virus spreads easily, including through patients who have no symptoms.\n\n\"If confirmed, this is very important,\" said Dr. Greg Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who was not involved with the study."

[.T]\n\nChina had 394 new cases on Wednesday, the lowest since Jan. 23. More than 2,100 people have died from the coronavirus in China, with eight deaths in other countries but not including the two from the quarantined cruise ship in Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's government reported 31 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday, after a new outbreak traced to a church, bringing the number of people infected in the country to 82.\n\nIn Japan, where the government has come under intense criticism for its handling of an outbreak on a cruise ship carrying about 3,700 people, broadcaster NHK reported that two passengers in their 80s had died.\n\n\n\n\n\nYEN TUMBLES\n\nCurrency markets were still reeling from an overnight plunge in the Japanese yen, which fell even as safe-haven assets such as gold climbed.

We have seen the yen and gold diverging for a while and this may not be the end of it,\" said Shafali Sachdev, head of FX in Asia at BNP Paribas Wealth Management.\n\n\"The kind of classic correlations between U.S. yields and the yen, those have been kind of breaking down...we need to see past this virus situation to see whether the yen will regain its safe-haven status.\"\n\nThe skittish mood had investors punishing the Australian dollar, sending it down 0.6% to an 11-year low of $0.6633 after a surprise rise in unemployment. [AUD/]\n\nElsewhere, oil prices added to overnight gains while gold loitered around $1,609 per ounce.\n\nU.S. crude last sat 25 cents firmer at $53.54 per barrel and Brent added 16 cents to $59.28.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Jacqueline Wong)"

It is India that is an even bigger problem, but it is an enormous problem. Nobody is doing anything about it,\" Bloomberg said in response to a question on climate change.\n\nHe was asked about his business which is heavily invested in China, the number one producer of carbon emissions in the world, and how far would he go to force Beijing to reduce those emissions and tackle the climate crisis.\n\n\"You're not going to go to war with them. You have to negotiate with them and we have seen how well that works with tariffs that are hurting us. What you have to do is convince the Chinese that it is in their interest as well, their people are going to die just as our people are going to die and we will work together,\" Bloomberg said in his response.\n\nThe billionaire and philanthropist, who announced his presidential run only this year, asserted that the US was making a difference.\n\n\"We are closing the coal-fired power plants. If we and for some of the rules on fracking so that they don't release methane into the air and into the water you will make a big difference but we are not going to get rid of fracking for a while and we frac incidentally not just natural gas, you frac oil as well,\" he said.\n\nThe United States has already closed 304 out of the 530 coal fired power plants and 80 of them have been closed in Europe, he said.\n\n\"Let's start at the beginning. If you're President, the first thing you do the first day is you rejoin the Paris agreement. This is just ridiculous for us to drop out,\" Bloomberg said, adding that America's responsibility is to be the leader in the world.\n\n\"And, if we don't, we are going to be the ones that get hurt just as much as anybody else and that's why I don't want to have us cut off all relationships with China because you will never solve this problem without China and India, western Europe and America,\" he said.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden accused China of spreading pollution across the world.\n\n\"The idea of China and their Belt and Road proposal is they are taking the dirtiest coal in the world mostly out of Mongolia and spreading it around the world,\" he said.\n\n\"It is clear they make it clear when you call them to Washington in the first 100 days if you continue you will suffer severe consequences because the rest of the world will impose terror of sand on everything you are selling because you are undercutting the entire economy,\" Biden said.\n\nIn June 2107, US President Donald Trump today declared that the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, saying the \"draconian\" deal unfairly punished America but benefited countries like India and China.\n\n\"It is time to exit the Paris Accord and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country,\" Trump had said, dampening global efforts to curb global warming.\n\n\"India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,\" Trump said."

            "content": "The hopes of India’s over 1.3 billion people were shattered after their country objectively failed to become the “superpower” that many of their leading “influencers” (read: propagandists) predicted it would be by 2020, with this finally being acknowledged by the popular Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena party last week after it did an about-face by pleading for Trump to reclassify their country as a “developing” one because it “is miles away from the status of developed countries on parameters like education, health, employment, cleanliness and poverty alleviation” and thus supposedly deserves to retain tariff-free access to the American market.\n\n“Superpower 2020”?\n\nIndians entered the current decade with bated breath, having been indoctrinated since shortly before the turn of the century with the completely false expectation that their country would finally become a “superpower” by 2020. They didn’t know exactly what this would mean in practice, but it sounded prestigious enough and was a welcome distraction from the abject poverty that marks many of their lives. After all, Prime Minister Modi told them last March that they were now a “space superpower” after successfully conducting an anti-satellite missile test. He then declared less than a month later ahead of the parliamentary elections in May of that year that only he could fulfill India’s “superpower” dreams. Then-BJP President Amit Shah seconded this statement shortly thereafter prior to it being reiterated by Modi’s Minister of State in September when he promised his people that India is on the “verge of being a superpower”. Once again, nobody ever really explained what being a “superpower” entailed, but the hyper-nationalist population wanted so desperately for the rest of the world to recognize them as one anyhow.\n\nAn Epic Disappointment Decades In The Making\n\nThat was why it was a disappointment of epic proportions for them that India entered 2020 without becoming the envy of the world like they falsely expected. The popular Indian online news site Scroll.in published a powerful piece at the time titled “India Superpower 2020: Tracing the brief history of a spectacularly incorrect prediction“, which touched upon the 1998 origin of the “superpower 2020” prediction and then explained its viral evolution across the proceeding years to the point where it basically became the country’s unofficial slogan over the last decade. Those who had earlier expressed their reservations about this unrealistic expectation were viciously attacked for being so-called “anti-nationals”, and if they weren’t Indian, then they were usually accused of “Hinduphobia”, but those defamatory abuses are no longer relevant after the influential Shiv Sena Hindu nationalist party publicly acknowledged that India isn’t even a “developed nation”, let alone anywhere near becoming a “superpower”.\n\nThe US Calls India’s “Superpower” Bluff\n\nThis was very important development because the organization contributes to framing the national narrative, meaning that Indians might never talk about being a “superpower” again, as if what Scroll.in described in their article as the nation’s “collective delusion” over the past two decades never happened at all. Shiv Sena didn’t suddenly switch their narrative from one of impending “superpower” status to that of India simply being yet another “super poor” “Global South” country no different from dozens of others just for sake of factual accuracy but because the nation stands to lose several billion dollars a year if it sticks to that debunked script. The US recently reclassified India as a “developed economy” ahead of Trump’s visit to the country later this month where he’s expected to sign major military and trade deals with America’s new strategic partner. Asia Times reported that this decision was made for technical reasons since India’s share of world trade was above the 0.5% threshold qualifying it for “developing economy” status, hence why nearly 2000 of its products are no longer eligible for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) regime that had previously given $5.7 billion in imports to the US duty-free status in 2017, thus making it the largest beneficiary of this program.\n\n$5 Billion In Economic Restrictions Got Shiv Sena To Switch Their Narrative\n\nShiv Sena, forgetting all about everything that it had said in the previous years about India’s supposedly imminent “superpower” status, furiously lashed out at the US last week by describing its move as “a big blow to our economy…a big crisis for India.”\n\nWalking back its entire narrative of India’s “miraculous growth” which had hitherto won it millions of devoted followers all across the country, the Hindu nationalist party repeated the same observations that the nation’s critics at home and abroad have been saying for years already, namely that “India is miles away from the status of developed countries on parameters like education, health, employment, cleanliness and poverty alleviation.” Evidently, speaking incessantly about India’s supposedly impending “superpower” status is useful for winning votes but becomes economically counterproductive the moment that the US acts like it believes that false narrative and then makes moves to eliminate the country’s preferential market access as a result. With $5.7 billion on the line, Shiv Sena had no choice but to tacitly admit that it and everyone else who had been celebrating India’s rise as a “superpower” were simply lying this whole time.\n\nIt’s No Longer “Hinduphobic” To Share Facts About India\n\nThere are some crucial lessons that other countries can learn from India’s humiliating experience, the most obvious of which is for political leaders to be more responsible when talking to the public about their country’s future status. Giving the largely impoverished masses unrealistically high expectations of global prestige using a never-defined slogan such as “superpower” is deceptive to the extreme and strongly suggests that they were deliberately manipulating their people for political purposes, likely to distract them from their dire economic situation with delusions of international grandeur. It’s all fun and games until the deadline for “superpower status” finally passed with a whimper and then the US took India at its word by restricting duty-free market access for $5.7 billion worth of its exports, thus dealing a heavy blow to some of its companies which were dependent on that regime in order to remain competitive. Shiv Sena is right, “India is miles away from the status of developed countries on parameters like education, health, employment, cleanliness and poverty alleviation”, but they were wrong for lying about that all this time, though at least those who repeat the party’s new rhetoric can finally speak freely without fear of being attacked as “anti-national” or “Hinduphobic”.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

Rich?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks Heather. And good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to share our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, an extremely successful year in which we drove growth while maintaining cost discipline and posted several new company records. Thanks to disciplined focus and execution, we delivered on the initial guidance we shared with you this time last year and turned in a strong financial performance. These results demonstrate the strength of the IMAX brand and unique value we create across the global entertainment ecosystem.\n\nOn Slide 4, we have the highlights for the full year, some of which include, record annual revenue of $396 million, up 6% year-over-year; record adjusted EBITDA of $149 million, up 12%; a 15% increase in adjusted earnings per share; 7% in global box office for an all-time record of $1.108 billion, and 9% growth in our commercial theater network as we continue to diversify our global brand footprint.\n\nAs we look ahead, we're focused on building on a strong position in several key ways. Strengthening and diversifying our content portfolio; two, growing and diversifying our global theater network; three, evolving our technology to provide the best possible experience to audiences and the best possible tools to creators; and four, capitalizing on strong demand for the IMAX experience in new ways.\n\nOf course, we clearly faced headwinds in China early this year due to the coronavirus. First, I want to say that our thoughts and prayers are with all those impacted by the outbreak in China and around the world. We continue to monitor the safety of our employees in China closely and are grateful that all are accounted for and healthy. In terms of the impact on our business, let me give you a brief update of what we know and provide some context. At this time all theaters in the country remain closed, we support the decision of the government to do all they can to contain the virus.\n\nOn Slide 5, you could see that prior to the coronavirus related closures, the IMAX China business was performing well and had strong momentum following a very successful 2019. At the close of 2019, our commercial theater network in China stood at 702 locations, up 13% year-over-year. Our 2019 Greater China box office of $366 million, was at an all-time high and grew by 9% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency, significantly outpacing the market growth of 5%. And nine of the Top 10 titles in China had an IMAX release in 2019, demonstrating our continued high hit rate, which has been driven by our flexible programming strategy.\n\nOverall, we're encouraged by the long-term performance and trajectory of our business in China. While the coronavirus is a serious short-term challenge, we see it as a rare out of the ordinary event that will ultimately pass. We are confident the business will rebound and resume delivering attractive growth and strong performance once conditions in China normalize.\n\nWell, every situation is unique. We believe that consumers will be eager to get out of their homes and return to shopping malls and cinema complexes for out of home entertainment, driving a rebound in box office, which is what occurred in Hong Kong post the SARS outbreak in 2003. Furthermore, at this time, we continue to expect that four of the postponed titles from our Chinese New Year slate will arrive in theaters sometime this year. While there are no guarantees, we expect that these releases will ultimately be rescheduled for multiple dates, giving them more room to breath rather than competing head to head as they would have during the New Year period. As a result, we believe they will be well positioned to capitalize on the strong audience demand we saw on pre-sales and buzz heading into Chinese New Year. Among those films is Detective Chinatown 3, one of the first Chinese local language releases to be filmed with IMAX cameras.\n\nMoving to 2020 more broadly, as we look at the 2020 slate we are encouraged by our pipeline for a number of reasons. First, many key titles feature IMAX technology, which serves as a key differentiator. We made a strategic effort to inject more IMAX DNA into our slate working with 3D filmmakers to utilize our technology to bring the biggest blockbusters to life. As we said, historically when filmmakers use our cameras, we tend to capture greater share of box office. In 2020, we will set a new record for releases that are filmed in IMAX with at least five of the year's biggest films, including, No Time to Die, the newest installment in the James Bond franchise, which will be released a few days early in our theaters. Wonder Woman 1984; Chris Nolan's latest sci-fi epic, Tenet; Paramount's Top Gun: Maverick and Detective Chinatown 3, which again at this time we anticipate will be released later this year. Top Gun will be certified as filmed in IMAX under new strategic initiatives, through which we certify top of the line digital cameras to shoot in IMAX when paired with our proprietary post production technology.\n\nSecond, the 2020 pipeline looks to be broad and balanced across the board. Full of films throughout the year that hold strong appeal with our audience. For Marvel's Black Widow and Eternals to Fast 9, which has already begun advance ticket sales for its main debut, to the sequel to the smash hit, Venom, for the highly anticipated adaptation of sci-fi class Dune.\n\nWe continue to drive global diversification of our content portfolio, an effort that has been very successful and is evident for our results in 2019. It's important to remember, IMAX is a global brand as you can see on Slide 7. In fact, our percentage of box office outside of North America, reached 67% in 2019, up from 65% in 2018.\n\nOn Slide 8, you can see that for the first time in 2019, our Greater China and Rest of World markets out grossed our domestic business. We set new yearly records in 2019 for local language box office, China box office and international box office outside of China. In fact we set new IMAX box office records in 27 countries worldwide. It is clear that our efforts to grow our network and capture the opportunity in international markets is bearing fruit. Furthermore, we are leveraging our brand, technology, and relationships across the industry to bring new types of content and experiences to our screens. With the proliferation of streaming platforms and content, we are seeing that streaming services are looking to eventicize their content, with an out-of-home experience in an effort to breakthrough the clutter. Partnering with streamers would also create a new content pipeline for IMAX and an opportunity to offer exclusive programming and drive utilization of the network. This continued diversification of content and global box office would help open new opportunities for us as we grow our theater network.\n\nWe also continue to see a very strong reception from exhibitors and audiences around our state of the art IMAX with laser technology. We installed nearly 100 laser systems for the full year, including a record number of system installations in the fourth quarter. We also signed up clients in key strategic markets like India, Japan, China, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Overall, we now have 1,529 commercial theaters worldwide. And while -- while that footprint gives us unique global scale, we still see significant room for growth.\n\nTurning to Slide 9, we recently updated the total addressable market for our network, an exercise to determine the growth potential for IMAX territory by territory over a period of about three years to five years in the future. We do this analysis regularly as global markets evolve and grow creating new opportunities for the company. The analysis use a set of key metrics, including addressable audience, theatrical box office, and content mix across territories, including opening backlog for new locations, our network stood at 1,963 theaters at year-end. However through our analysis, we now believe our network has the potential to grow to more than 3,300 locations worldwide. This year we plan to aggressively target high-growth emerging markets where we're most under-penetrated such as Japan, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and South America. We already have solid momentum in that effort, having recently signed an expansion of our relationship with Cinepolis, a key partner in emerging markets that will see us expand our presence in markets including Dubai and Peru.\n\nImportantly, building out our international footprint will put IMAX in an excellent position to capitalize on the highly anticipated content pipeline for 2021 as seen on Slide 10. Major Hollywood films scheduled to be released in 2021 includes four Marvel titles including the latest installments of Spider-Man and Thor, the highly anticipated new Batman film, new entrants from global blockbuster franchises, including Fast & Furious 10, Mission: Impossible and Jurassic World, and of course James Cameron's Avatar 2, the sequel of the highest grossing IMAX film of all time. We believe that the vast majority of the projected Top 10 releases for 2021 have the potential to top $1 billion in global box office. Beyond the box office, we continue to create opportunities to expand our ecosystem and add new high quality revenue streams.\n\nMoving to Slide 12, we continue to grow our IMAX Enhanced initiative, through which we will partner with streaming platforms, studios and high-end device manufacturers to bring IMAX content into the home. The offering is now available on nascent streaming platform in the US, Europe, China, and Japan. We have premium partners across major in home device categories from TVs, to speakers, to receivers, enabling consumers to create a complete home theater experience through IMAX.\n\nOverall, IMAX Enhanced today is available in 14 countries globally across 3 million devices and our content portfolio continues to grow. For instance, last year our release of Spider-Man: Far From Home on IMAX Enhance made it the first Marvel title ever to be available on IMAX exclusive expanded aspect ratio for the home. As we capitalize on the in home opportunities created by SVOD, we're also looking to capitalize on the out-of-home opportunity created by skyrocketing experienced economy. IMAX is among the broadest out-of-home distribution platforms in the world. We believe there is an attractive opportunity as consumers led by millennials increasingly value and choose to spend on out-of-home experiences over material good. Market research firm, Euromonitor estimates the experienced economy will grow to $8 trillion by 2030. We are increasingly using our platform, which builds more than 0.5 million seats across 81 countries and territories worldwide to explore unique experiences from Esports to exclusive music events and beyond that leverage our scale, technology, as well as the strength of our brands and our relationships with creators.\n\nIn conclusion, IMAX delivered very strong results in 2019 and our continued ability to deliver is a result of the unique privilege position we built in the ecosystem. Consumers seek out the IMAX experience for immersive blockbuster experiences, studios value IMAX as a mark of a must see film and a powerful partner in marketing and driving box office for their biggest releases. The world's best filmmakers and now creators more broadly are increasingly using our end-to-end technology to bring their creativity to life. Exhibitors rely on our theaters to provide a premium experience that drives ticket pricing, volume, and differentiation.\n\nAnd finally streaming services offers strong new opportunities for us to bring new event content to our theaters and bring the IMAX experience to home entertainment. With the global scale of our network, we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the change at hand in the entertainment industry, and we're confident in our ability over the long term to continue to drive our overall financial performance.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Patrick.\n\nPatrick McClymont -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks Rich, and good afternoon everyone. On the same call a year ago, I discussed three things that matter in assessing the quality of any business, growth, margins and return. During 2019, IMAX continue to produce improving results across each of these metrics.\n\nLet's start with growth. 2019 built of the progress we achieved in 2018. Total revenue increased 6% and box office increased by 7%, delivering on the initial guidance we provided early last year. Next, margin. As many of you know, our adjusted EBITDA margin previously peaked in 2015 at 40.5%. More recently, we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in 2017 and again in 2018. For 2019, we guided to adjusted EBITDA margin in line with 2015 and in fact we surpassed that level at a new peak of 41.7%.\n\nFinally, returns. We like to look at returns before the impact of the minority interest for the public shareholders in the China business. This allows us to assess returns of the whole enterprise we are managing regardless of ownership structure. Once again 2018 was the inflection point for our return profile and the top line grew, margins expanded and we controlled expenses. We continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation 2019. As evidenced by our consolidated ROIC of 10.3%, in line with our guidance. Overall, notwithstanding the current situation in China, our long-term growth, margin, and return metrics are solidly on positive trend line.\n\nTurning to our financial results. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $124 million, up 14% versus last year, resulting in $396 million for the year, an increase of 6%. Moving to our main business segment. For 2019, we saw the network business deliver a 4% increase in gross profit of a 7% increase in revenue. Gross margin pressure was generally due to the increased contractual marketing expenses encouraged during the second quarter. The theater business delivered gross profit, that was up slightly versus 2018. It's important to note that first quarter of 2018 as unusually high installation margins and 2019 reflects the early phase cost profile of our new laser product. Importantly, we saw sequential gross margin improvement in our STL theater system installs as the year progressed, ending with a fourth quarter margin of 53% and our total theater business margin of 51.2% was up 410 basis points year-over-year.\n\nMoving on to operating expenses, which we define as SG&A plus R&D, less stock compensation, were $108 million for the year, down 3% versus last year, which is better than our guidance, which called for flat opex. In fact, 2019 marks the fourth consecutive year of opex in this range and the lowest level since in 2015, which is particularly impressive when you consider that our commercial network has increased more than 60% over that same period. Please note that sequential spike in SG&A from the third quarter of 2019 to Q4 was primarily due to the timing of marketing expenses that shifted later in the year as well as an executive transition costs.\n\nNet income for the quarter was $18.2 million or $0.29 per share, while adjusted net income was $21.5 million or $0.35 per share versus $0.26 last year or an increase of 35%. For the year, net income was $46.9 million or $0.76 per share, while adjusted net income was $64.8 million or $1.05 per share, up 15% versus last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47 million, up 29% versus last year, producing adjusted EBITDA margins of 41.7%, up 440 basis points versus last year. This resulted in full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA $149 million, up 12% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margins of 41.7%, as I previously mentioned.\n\nAs Rich mentioned on, Slide 8, you can see the benefit of global diversification. Last year -- large year-over-year gains in Rest of World and Greater China drove our 7% increase in gross box office. Turning to our theater signings activity. Our sales team delivered 143 total signings for the full year, of which 104 were for new theaters. We installed 58 new IMAX systems in the fourth quarter and 95 systems overall. For the year, we installed 186 system, of which 129 were for new systems and 57 were for upgrades. It's worth noting -- it's worth highlighting that our Rest of World network grew by 9% year-over-year and with 417 commercial multiplexes in operation is now larger than our domestic network.\n\nOur backlog has also shifted to 60% sale and hybrid, up from 52% last year as we continue to identify the most appropriate business model to deploy around the world on a theater by theater basis. We ended 2019 having generated $24 million of free cash flow, calculated as net cash from operating activities less cash used in investing activities. As a reminder in 2019, we spent approximately $22 million on share repurchases, primarily of our IMAX China stock. As a result, our ownership of IMAX China is now 69.7% compared to 68.2% a year-ago. We also strategically invested in Maoyan, a leading movie ticket platform in China and 2019 capital expenditures were $74.3 million, down from $80.1 million in 2018, our lowest level in six years.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020. Obviously, the situation in China, makes it difficult to provide a box office outlook. What we can say is that outside of China, our quarter-to-date box office results are generally in line with our internal plan. While the near-term impact to IMAX is material, partially offsetting the impact is our network growth and positive trends in the Rest of the World. Regarding installations, once again given the situation in China, it is difficult to provide projected range. That said, we are pleased with our momentum in new and emerging market. And expect our network outside of Greater China to grow by mid to high single-digit, which is a slightly higher growth rate than 2019.\n\nFor the first quarter specifically, we expect a total of 10 installations broken down as follows. Five new install -- five new installations pre-sale and two JV and five JV upgrades to IMAX with Laser. Of the total 10 -- 12 [Phonetic] installations five are already complete. SG&A related stock-based compensation is expected to be around $22 million for the year. We also anticipate our full year effective tax rate approximately in line with 2019.\n\nTo close, we are pleased with the positive momentum we have witnessed over the past couple of years. Our strategy and execution in 2019 position us to capitalize on the IMAX centric 2020 slate and what looks to be an extraordinary content play in 2021.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rich for his concluding thoughts, before we open up the call to Q&A.\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, let's just open up to questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Eric Handler, MKM Partners.\n\nEric Handler -- MKM Partners -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. Hope you can hear me OK, I'm in an airport, so I apologize for excess noise. But Rich, two questions for you. First, it's great to see you guys updating your addressable market, you said it was three years to five years out, so I'm just curious, what was the prior baseline that we're using for North America, China, and Rest of World, just so -- because I believe your prior guidance was for 10 years. So like I said, this is three years to five years.\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nNo, no, no. It's always -- it's always three years to five years, Eric. The reason is because the economies changed, the -- so it's the same basis as the last one was prepared. While you ask your second question, is that the number? It was about [Indecipherable]\n\nEric Handler -- MKM Partners -- Analyst\n\nAbout 28.50 [Phonetic] perfect, thank you. Great. And then secondly, with IMAX Enhanced, obviously you have some interesting data points to share here, is there -- have we reached some inflection point with this new business that maybe we start seeing revenue ramping a little bit more aggressively in the coming quarters or is this still a very nascent don't put a lot in there -- in that line item business?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI would say for this year, it's still a nascent don't put a lot in there line item basis. But we've been making some strategic progress. Again no, if we follow through on these things, we'll let you know. But I think we are close to a tipping point where it could be a business that contributes in the years going forward, but not this year.\n\nEric Handler -- MKM Partners -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nNext up is Alexia Quadrani, JPMorgan.\n\nAlexia Quadrani -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. I will take first on the coronavirus, how has it impacted do you think the movie going sort of behavior or experience or just traffic in general in Asia ex-China, sort of looking into other markets outside of China within Asia?\n\nAnd then a sort of a second question sort of staying on this topic, I guess how should we think about the piracy risk or maybe more minimal interest in going to a Hollywood film that has a delayed release in China, sort of later in the year, well after it was already released here in the US?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo your first question, Alexia. We haven't really seen an impact outside of China. And in fact, as we said in our scripted comments, the Rest of the World and the domestic market separately are very close to what our budget was at the beginning of the year. So there hasn't been really a noticeable impact.\n\nThe second thing would be the piracy risk. You know it's hard to gauge as we looked at after SARs happened in Hong Kong, the first half of the year was extremely weak, but the second half of the year was really very strong. And that's really the only measurement we have to go by. I think you are -- your point is well taken that impact some films clearly won't be able to be day and date because they are not being released right now, but I think you're condensing a year's worth of movies into however many months it is when it's open. So I think you have a lot more Hollywood movies in a shorter period than it would have been, but for this. So when you blend it all out, it may affect some movies, but I would expect it would probably be shorter play times because there are so many more movies out there in that period of time, but it's premature to quantify it.\n\nAlexia Quadrani -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\n\nAll right. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Eric Wold, B. Riley.\n\nEric Wold -- B. Riley -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Two question if I may. I guess, first off, Rich on the increase in TAM from 2050 [Phonetic] to 3300 plus, maybe kind of dive into that a little bit deeper kind of -- where you talk kind of where those markets or screen opportunity came from when you are small markets that previously couldn't support the screen, but now it can because of reduced cost of entry, with a market now developing in terms of overall movie going demand maybe where does that demand came from?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, I think the main markets Eric, the Middle East and specifically Saudi, which obviously didn't exist before last year as a market, Southeast Asia, India, Japan maybe a little bit South America. Again, just to remind you of the methodology, we do a bottoms-up approach every couple of years and it's done in combination with our field managers as well as our sales staff and we look at what's happened to the number of theaters in that country, the addressable market, ticket prices, resolve it out things like that, but that's kind of our best guess.\n\nEric Wold -- B. Riley -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And then Patrick, on the -- as you think about China and the kind of delayed releases of the titles in that market. I guess both for China only local language title as well, Hollywood ones being released in that market, how is the timing of delayed releases or even cancellations this week if there are, impact DMR cost recognition?\n\nPatrick McClymont -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nFor the local language titles we've done the work with Hollywood titles and so we've already had those expenditures, but we won't actually amortize that until they get released. And so just push it out until deeper into the year once those get scheduled. And for Hollywood, it will be probably titled releasing around the world, we'll continue to amortize those as they release, but we'll push some of the amortization deeper into the year once they get released in China.\n\nEric Wold -- B. Riley -- Analyst\n\nI guess the question was assuming it is cancelled not released theatrically, these expenses when do they eventually hit you?\n\nPatrick McClymont -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, if something were truly canceled and we haven't yet sent anything on the DMR then it's just it would come out of our numbers. If something gets canceled that we've already done the work on, then once it becomes canceled, we'd have to just run that through the P&L. But keep in mind that the way it works, the DMR work is done here for the China pays us for that and so as those things unfold there'd be an impact on the China P&L and a small impact on the core P&L as well.\n\nEric Wold -- B. Riley -- Analyst\n\nGot it. It's helpful, thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nUp next we'll hear from Vasily Karasyov, Cannonball Research.\n\nVasily Karasyov -- Cannonball Research -- Analyst\n\nHello, good afternoon. Thank you. Couple of questions. First, wanted to ask you to talk a little more about the drivers of the strength in international, ex-China box office in 2019, which was in dollar terms I think is the largest driver of year-on-year increase, what you're seeing by territory in terms of PSAs, because I think there was a concern that as you expand PSAs will drop. And so, wondering if you could give us some color on that?\n\nAnd the second question I'll ask right away, is it differently now to be dealing with five Hollywood studios, major Hollywood studios than with six, just curious how it changed your business, the acquisition of Fox by Disney? Thank you.\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo your first question, international ex-China. I think it's driven by a lot of theater growth and high-performance markets. So our Japan market will become much more penetrated and we have extremely successful theaters there and we're growing those fairly rapidly. The Middle East would be another area I would identify growing, India is another market that's been growing well, Europe. So I think on the expansion of our network, particularly in higher ticket price markets Germany would be another one, has really driven that. The second part was your PSAs, I don't have that by region off hand, but I can tell you that last year worldwide IMAX's PSAs, were up 2%.\n\nVasily Karasyov -- Cannonball Research -- Analyst\n\nRight. Then the [Speech Overlap]\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe haven't really seen an impact. At present we have a wonderful relationship with this being and ourselves. Fox has gotten integrated, we released a number of Fox movies through Disney and I don't really think there has been a change.\n\nVasily Karasyov -- Cannonball Research -- Analyst\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nUp next we'll hear from Mike Hickey, The Benchmark Company.\n\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\n\nHi Rich, Patrick. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on quarter guys. It looks like the coronavirus is driving an impact on stock, just curious your thoughts on any buyback moving forward, if you think you can be more aggressive, if you'd be buying in the quarter and in part that will be helpful?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe have a buyback authorization in place. We've said before that we'll be opportunistic and we will be. And that's about all I can say right now.\n\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\n\nOkay, good. Are you hearing anything, I guess, encouraging from China in terms of, when you think theaters are going to start opening up again, if it's going to be all at once or rollout? Or any positive signs coming from the region?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI mean, it's very hard to predict when the theaters will open up, because there are a lot of issues. It's not just the slowdown of the infection, but there's also getting infrastructure back and what government policies are. And certainly, we're not smart enough to predict that. There have been, over the last couple of days, some small positive signs such as number of cures has exceeded the number of new infections and things like that. And I think if you focus on some of the Tier 1 cities, clearly it hasn't been close to as dull as it has been in Wuhan and the surrounding province.\n\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\n\nI mean if the closure extends further, do have concerns that you may see some of the slate migrate to streaming like we saw with [Indecipherable]?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI'm sorry, it got garbled at the end. I got it. Not really. I mean, there was one film that went to streaming during Chinese New Year, but that was a unique situation where a particular service had a relationship with a director and the movie had some financial issues where it needed to recoup in a period of time, and that issues where it needed to recoup in a period of time, and that has not been very well received by the Chinese exhibition or studio community. So I don't think we'll see that.\n\nMike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\n\nOkay then. Thank you very much. Best of luck.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jim Goss, Barrington Research.\n\nJim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\n\nThanks. You have a number of motivations in terms of various markets in which you can expand your franchise that you've been outlining. Does this situation in China make you veer toward some of these other potential growth markets, just to sort of balance out the risk or does the bottoms-up approach and growth in China, do you expect will return, keep your efforts in that area as it has been?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nHey, Jim, in China, we created $1 billion business in terms of value. And it's -- there's been a black swan event that happened. I don't regret doing that. And we'll be doing business in China for a very long time. And I don't think a black swan event is going to change that, and we'll explore all opportunities throughout globally. But despite this obvious short-term setback, we remain long-term, as excited about China as we've ever been.\n\nJim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\n\nOkay, fair enough. And to the extent that you know this silver lining might have developed and that some of these movies that were going to be focused on Chinese New Year are going to spread over the rest of the year, I'm thinking back to the greater usage of the entire calendar domestically for Hollywood, do you think you might want to push that issue more in future years, just to take advantage of more of a calendar than you have been? And how much can you influence that process?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo we certainly, in general can influence release dates, but I think the Hollywood studios have a fair line in the sand about not sharing screens, and I don't think we have the ability to influence that policy. In China, even before this, they've been open to screen sharing in multiple titles. And as a matter of fact, we were going to play multiple titles during the New Year period. So I don't think this sad event has affected that one way or the other.\n\nJim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\n\nOkay, last question. You noted the new growth levers, streaming partnerships. Is there any conflict with the exhibitor stance in terms of when those issues that might require some adjustments or negotiations or do you think that can be finessed?\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI don't think it's going to be an issue, Jim. We played a short form piece called Anima, concert [Phonetic] film shot by Paul Thomas Anderson. And it was released by Netflix very close to when it was released and the exhibitors didn't have an issue with that. I think their issue is -- we're doing around traditional movies. So I don't think that will be an issue.\n\nJim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\n\nAll right, thanks very much. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd everyone, at this time there are no further questions, I'd like to hand things back to Mr. Gelfond for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nRichard L. Gelfond -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, thank you very much operator. And thank you everyone for joining our call. Obviously, 2019 was a very strong year for us. As Patrick said in his script, we outlined for you all on what we hope to accomplish financially and we met virtually all of those goals during the year. We expect it to use that momentum into this year, but unfortunately the sad events in China around the coronavirus have made it a tough start, but what we look at the film slate this year, we look at the film slate next year, we look at the growth we deliver and our expanded view of the markets, we can penetrate once we get past this period. We think we'll resume the kinds of things we've demonstrated in 2019. So thank you all for joining our call.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\n\nDuration: 44 minutes\n\nCall participants:\n\nHeather Anthony -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nRichard L.

            "content": "India poses a bigger problem than China when it comes to fighting climate change, particularly on reducing carbon emissions, Democratic presidential aspirant and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has said.\n\nDuring his maiden appearance on a Democratic presidential primary debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg said it was “ridiculous” of the Trump administration to take the U.S. out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as he outlined his approach to tackling climate change.\n\n“In all fairness, the Chinese have slowed down. It is India that is an even bigger problem, but it is an enormous problem. Nobody is doing anything about it,” Mr. Bloomberg said in response to a question on climate change.\n\nAlso Read Greening the powerhouses\n\nHe was asked about his business which is heavily invested in China, the number one producer of carbon emissions in the world, and how far would he go to force Beijing to reduce those emissions and tackle the climate crisis.\n\n“You’re not going to go to war with them. You have to negotiate with them and we have seen how well that works with tariffs that are hurting us. What you have to do is convince the Chinese that it is in their interest as well, their people are going to die just as our people are going to die and we will work together,” Mr. Bloomberg said in his response.\n\nThe billionaire and philanthropist, who announced his presidential run only this year, asserted that the U.S. was making a difference.\n\nAlso Read A case for a differential global carbon tax\n\n“We are closing the coal-fired power plants. If we and for some of the rules on fracking so that they don’t release methane into the air and into the water you will make a big difference but we are not going to get rid of fracking for a while and we frac incidentally not just natural gas, you frac oil as well,” he said.\n\nThe United States has already closed 304 out of the 530 coal fired power plants and 80 of them have been closed in Europe, he said.\n\n“Let’s start at the beginning. If you’re President, the first thing you do the first day is you rejoin the Paris agreement. This is just ridiculous for us to drop out,” Mr. Bloomberg said, adding that America’s responsibility is to be the leader in the world.\n\nAlso Read The wheels to a low-carbon transport system\n\n“And, if we don’t, we are going to be the ones that get hurt just as much as anybody else and that’s why I don’t want to have us cut off all relationships with China because you will never solve this problem without China and India, western Europe and America,” he said.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden accused China of spreading pollution across the world.\n\n“The idea of China and their Belt and Road proposal is they are taking the dirtiest coal in the world mostly out of Mongolia and spreading it around the world,” he said.\n\n“It is clear they make it clear when you call them to Washington in the first 100 days if you continue you will suffer severe consequences because the rest of the world will impose terror of sand on everything you are selling because you are undercutting the entire economy,” Mr. Biden said.\n\nIn June 2107, U.S. President Donald Trump today declared that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, saying the “draconian” deal unfairly punished America but benefited countries like India and China.\n\n“It is time to exit the Paris Accord and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country,” Mr. Trump had said, dampening global efforts to curb global warming.\n\n“India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,” Mr. Trump said."

            "content": "GoI to launch “TILHAN Mission” to make India Self Reliant in oil seed Production\n\nOn February 19, 2020, the Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced that Government of India is to launch “TILHAN MISSION” to boost the oil seed production. The announcement was made at an occasion of Soil Health Card Day. Soil Health Card Day was celebrated all over India on February 19, 2020.\n\nHighlights\n\nGovernment of India is to increase oil seed production in order to make the country self-reliant in oil seed production.\n\nThe Minister also announced that GoI is to create 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations all over the country. In order to support this, the GoI is to provide Rs 6,000 rupees.\n\nCurrent Oil Seed Scenario in India\n\nIndia is the fourth largest vegetable oil economy in the world after USA, China and Brazil. Today, the oil seeds account for 13% of cropped area in the country.\n\nThe National Mission on Oil Seeds and Oil Palm was launched by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare. The scheme was to be implemented for 5 years between 2014-15 and 2018-19.\n\nIndia-Malaysia\n\nRecently, there has been major rifts between India and Malaysia over Palm oil. Malaysia at the United Nations General Assembly meet placed open accusations on India for abrogating Article 370 and its other steps towards development of Kashmir. Malaysian PM accused India of invading and occupying Kashmir. According to India, Kashmir issue is completely internal and is between India and Pakistan to settle upon.\n\nFollowing such accusations, India gradually decreased its Palm oil imports from Malaysia. In September 2019, the palm oil imports (before the Malaysian PM’s accusation) were 310,648 tonnes. In October, the imports were reduced to 219,956 tonnes and in November it was 142,696 tonnes.\n\nIndia is the largest importer of palm oil in the world. And oil exports are highly important for the Malaysian economy as it accounts to 2.8% of its GDP and 4.5% of its total exports.\n\nInference\n\nIndia having cut its imports from Malaysia, is now on the plan of increasing its domestic oil seed production.\n\nGet these updates on Current Affairs Today Android App\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonth:Current Affairs – February, 2020\n\nCategories: Government Schemes in India\n\nTags: Agricultural Commodities • Agriculture • Article 370 • India-Malaysia • Oilseeds\n\n"

            "content": "Editor’s note: Six Democratic candidates met on the debate stage in Las Vegas on Feb. 19, discussing health care, immigration, billionaires and economic equality – as well as the name of the president of Mexico. We asked two scholars to pick out what they viewed as the night’s biggest moments as Nevada Democrats get ready for their caucuses on Feb. 22.\n\nBoth Lisa DeFrank-Cole, a professor of leadership studies at West Virginia University, and Jeffrey Waddoups, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, highlighted moments when Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren engaged in a fierce back-and-forth across the stage.\n\nLisa DeFrank-Cole, West Virginia University\n\nElizabeth Warren: “Can I defend Senator Klobuchar for a minute? Look, you want to ask about whether or not you understand trade policy with Mexico? Have at it. If you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable. … Let’s be clear: Missing a name all by itself does not indicate that you do not understand what is going on.”\n\nIn an era of political leaders bullying those they disagree with, it is refreshing to see one stand up for a competitor.\n\nEven though Warren attacked Amy Klobuchar’s health care policy by saying it could fit on a “Post-it note,” she stood up for her colleague during another exchange, when Klobuchar was weathering criticism that she hadn’t remembered the name of Mexico’s president. Warren’s dual role of critic and defender in the debate reflects a challenge every woman leader faces.\n\nThough a recent Gallup Poll found most Americans say they would vote for a woman for president, it is still not a sure thing. Society still expects women to be nurturing and helpful, not argumentative or decisive. Men, on the other hand, can be tough and strong with little or no regard for kindness.\n\nIt is hard for a woman leader to be seen as both likable and competent at the same time. This double bind makes it a challenge for women on the campaign trail like Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. They need to project warmth and compassion while also demonstrating the ability to get the job done. Their task is difficult: Be smart, but not arrogant. Be kind, but not weak. Be feminine, but not emotional.\n\nIn addition, it’s dangerous to focus on being a woman and to seek sympathy for having a harder time than your male competitors.\n\nBy attacking one of Klobuchar’s policies, and then within the same debate coming back to defend her fellow senator, Warren is projecting warmth and compassion. This is the dance that women leaders do every day: Take two steps toward strength and one step back to show kindness. It’s a dizzying maneuver to master.\n\nJeffrey Waddoups, University of Nevada, Las Vegas\n\nElizabeth Warren: “This country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt.”\n\nThere was a time in U.S. history when prosperity was more or less equitably shared across all economic classes. During the period that started just after World War II until 1978, increases in the minimum wage and the income of the median household reliably matched up with increases in productivity of the overall economy.\n\nDuring those years, increasing prosperity in the overall economy generally translated into proportionate increases in the prosperity of workers and middle-income households. In a real sense, the economy was working not only for the wealthy, but for middle-income and lower-income workers as well.\n\nThen things shifted: Starting in the late 1970s, productivity as measured by output per worker continued its upward march. But the economic well-being of middle- and lower-income employees stagnated. Most workers were no longer sharing proportionately in the economy’s prosperity.\n\nThat disconnection was accompanied by the weakening of two important forces for better wages: a minimum wage that tracked with inflation, and widespread collective bargaining. Both of those elements give workers power – which Nevada’s Culinary Workers Union wants to protect.\n\nThe current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, a number that has not risen since 2009. That amount has roughly 30% less buying power than the $1.60 hourly minimum wage in 1968, an amount worth $10.15 in today’s dollars, when adjusted for inflation. Many state and local governments have set higher minimum wages, but hundreds of thousands of workers across the country are earning the federal minimum.\n\nSimilarly, union representation has dropped since the 1970s. In 1979, 27% of American workers were represented by unions. In 2019, that number was just 11.6% – meaning millions of workers today don’t have the bargaining power to get wages and working conditions that similarly situated workers in the past enjoyed."

            "content": "Gold rose and global equity markets slid on Tuesday after Apple said it was unlikely to meet its sales guidance because of the coronavirus outbreak in China, a warning highlighting the epidemic's threat to global growth and corporate profits.\n\nChina reported its fewest new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll in a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should be viewed with caution.\n\nChinese officials reported 1,886 new cases - the first time the daily figure has fallen below 2,000 since January 30.\n\nApple said on Monday that manufacturing facilities in China that produce its iPhone and other electronics had begun to reopen, but were ramping up slower than expected.\n\nThe disruption in China will result in fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak.\n\nGold climbed more than 1 percent to a two-week high as investors sought safety in the wake of Apple's warning. The price of Brent, the global crude benchmark, fell below US$57 a barrel but later rebounded on reduced supply from oil-rich Libya.\n\nForecasters, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), have cut 2020 oil demand estimates because of the virus.\n\nEquity markets around the world fell, with MSCI's all-country world index slipping 0.52 percent.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.38 percent and emerging market stocks lost 1.18 percent.\n\nHSBC's announcement that it would shed USUS$100 billion in assets, shrink its investment bank and revamp its U.S. and European businesses in a drastic overhaul added to concerns about the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nThe UK-based bank, whose huge Asian operations are headquartered in Hong Kong, said the coronavirus epidemic had significantly impacted staff and customers. HSBC shares fell 6.35 percent, leading the FTSE 100 index to close down 0.69 percent.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 159.18 points, or 0.54 percent, to 29,238.9, the S&P 500 lost 9.03 points, or 0.27 percent, to 3,371.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.79 points, or 0.04 percent, to 9,734.97.\n\n\"We're seeing some renewed weakness in the stock markets following the announcement by Apple,\" said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen. \"It's having a global impact on supply chains and shipments - this will have a negative impact on growth expectations.\"\n\nUS stocks pared losses and the Nasdaq edged higher on speculation the hit to global supply chains by the coronavirus will be temporary.\n\nOvernight in Asia, China's CSI300 blue chip stocks index lost 0.5 percent after gaining sharply on Monday, encouraged by a central bank rate cut and government stimulus hopes.\n\nJapan's Nikkei lost 1.40 percent.\n\nThe dollar rose to nearly a three-week high against the euro after Germany's ZEW survey of economic sentiment showed slumping investor confidence in Europe's largest economy.\n\nThe euro was down 0.41 percent to US$1.079, while the dollar index rose 0.44 percent. The Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback at 109.89 per dollar.\n\nThe ZEW research institute said in its monthly survey that investors' mood deteriorated far more than expected in February on worries over the coronavirus' effect on world trade.\n\nThe survey added to expectations the German economy will lose more momentum in the first half as slumping exports keep manufacturers mired in a recession.\n\nSafe-haven German 10-year bond yields fell to -0.43 percent at one point. Other 10-year bond yields in Europe fell similarly.\n\nUS Treasury yields also fell. The benchmark 10-year note rose 11/32 in price, pushing its yield down to 1.5525 percent.\n\nOil prices slid over the expected impact of the coronavirus on crude demand and a lack of further action by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to support the market.\n\nCrude rebounded on the collapse of Libyan oil output since January 18 because of a blockade of ports and oilfields.\n\nBrent crude rose 8 cents to settle at US$56.93 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude settled flat, or unchanged at US$52.05 a barrel.\n\nUS gold futures settled 1.1 percent higher at US$1,603.60 an ounce."

            "content": "Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – Many policy and scientific questions have the form of a Whodunnit. In what Umberto Eco called the “closed” mystery, the aftermath of a crime is described by the novelist but the identity and the motives of the killer are not known.\n\nA big mystery is where all the methane in our atmosphere has come from. Since 1820, the average amount of methane has about doubled. Nearly 200 teragrams of methane seems to be going into the atmosphere every year. How much of that is produced by nature? Or are human activities releasing it in unusual amounts? Whodunnit?\n\nThe question is important because methane is 80 times more powerful as a heat-trapping gas than carbon dioxide (which is no slouch itself). About 25 percent of our current global heating is caused by methane.\n\nWhere did that 25% come from?\n\nThe detective, whether a policeman (in the case of “procedurals”) or a private detective or even private individual discovers clues that point to the identity of the perpetrator and her or his motives. Where the perpetrator is the boss of the detective, that is called a noir, from the French word for black. In a noir, the Establishment itself is corrupt and the detective does not realize that his or her efforts are being thwarted by the very people who are supposed to enforce the law. Dashiell Hammett maintained that when he was working for the Pinkertons he was sent to bust a mining strike in Montana. The implication is that his bosses wanted the chief union organizer to be murdered. This incident led him to write noir. Some have doubted his story, but it seems to me that working in the Pinkertons, a private security firm of the early twentieth century, could certainly have soured a person on the probity of American institutions.\n\nWe live in a very noir world, at the moment– Trump is the ultimate noir villain.\n\nJonathan Watts at The Guardian explores the implications of a new scientific paper in the journal Nature. To settle whether nature routinely puts a lot of methane into the atmosphere, Benjamin Hmiel and his colleagues examined an ice core sample from 300 years ago.\n\nWell, we’ve eliminated a murder suspect, folks. Volcanic activity and other geological processes only put 5.4 teragrams of methane into the atmosphere every year back in 1720. They just are very unlikely to be behaving any differently today. Some estimates had geology account for 60 teragrams of methane annually. It ain’t so. it is just 5.\n\nSo of the nearly 200 teragrams of methane that are put into our atmosphere every year, it is oil and gas drilling and fracking that are responsible for almost all of it.\n\nThis is a noir conclusion. It is our corrupt fossil fuel establishment that committed the crime.\n\nFracking or hydraulic fracturing is particularly thuggish. Another recent paper in Nature used satellite imaging to prove that “In the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, methane columns showed maxima over regions with the highest natural gas production.”\n\nSo we knew that drilling for oil and then burning it in automobiles puts heat-trapping CO2 in the atmosphere and contributes the lion’s share to global heating. But now it is clear that it also releases methane. Moreover, fracked oil and gas is particularly productive of methane.\n\nProponents of fracked natural gas argue that it is less carbon-intensive than coal. This is true. But if it is putting out enormous amounts of methane, then its advantage over coal may dwindle. Wind and solar are much better than both of them and Scotland has shown that a modern economy can rapidly implement them if it wants to (all Scotland’s electricity consumption will be from green energy by the end of this year).\n\nMethane, unlike carbon dioxide, doesn’t stay in the atmosphere that long. About nine years. So if we stopped putting 200 teragrams of it up there every year, by 2030 we’d reduce global heating by a quarter.\n\nThe conclusion is that we should replace fossil fuels as quickly as possible with wind and solar and geothermal.\n\nBut the other conclusion is that we should outlaw fracking immediately.\n\n—-\n\nBonus video:\n\nNASA Climate Change: “Methane in the Climate System: Monitoring Emissions from Satellites”"

The social network connects billions of users around the world, and is for many of them their principal way of receiving news and engaging with their community. When Facebook’s systems are exploited by Russia to interfere in elections, by extremists to live-stream their atrocities, or by armed gangs to carry out attacks on their rivals, we are right to ask what more could have been done to prevent this.\n\nAs an advertising business which gathers huge amounts of data about everything its users do on Facebook we are right to challenge the company about why more can’t be done to prevent people sharing images of child abuse, videos that seek to recruit people into terror organisations, or content that might encourage people to self-harm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust two years ago, the Cambridge Analytica scandal lead to widespread concern about how users’ personal Facebook data could end up in the hands of a company whose chief executive boasted in an undercover film about the effectiveness of hiring Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians.\n\nAt the time, Facebook said it was carrying out an audit into other developers who might also have acquired data in breach of the company’s rules and without users’ informed consent.

It will have surprised no-one that he doesn’t believe that any of these new rules need apply to Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his article in the Financial Times on February 16, Zuckerberg called for “more oversight and accountability” on decisions around content moderation on social media. However, in Facebook’s case this accountability would be guaranteed by a new “independent” Oversight Board, to be launched in the summer. This Board is being recruited by Facebook, and its remit is limited to considering whether the company has implemented its own policies correctly.\n\nAs Article 7 of the Oversight Board’s charter makes clear: “The board will not purport to enforce local law” when reviewing Facebook’s content-moderation decisions. What’s more, the Oversight Board will not be allowed to moderate on “content on WhatsApp, Messenger, [or] Instagram Direct”. This happens as Facebook is about to introduce end-to-end encryption to its messaging tools, in so doing further limiting any responsibility it might have to moderate them. This policy has been described by chief constable Simon Bailey, the UK National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, as one that “will knowingly put the safety of children at risk – ignoring the warnings of police, charities and experts across the world.”\n\nFrom a policy paper published by Facebook to coincide with Zuckerberg’s trip to Europe, entitled “Charting a way forward: online content regulation”, it’s even clearer that the direction he wants to take us on is a road to nowhere. This paper argues against establishing liability on social media companies for failing to remove illegal and harmful content. It also warns against creating mandatory standards for content removal, and tougher enforcement of citizens data rights. Instead it proposes that there should be “periodic public reporting of enforcement data”, based of course on self-declaration by the company, without any independent external audit.\n\nRead next Think Goop is bad? It's only the tip of Netflix's pseudoscience iceberg Think Goop is bad? It's only the tip of Netflix's pseudoscience iceberg\n\nFacebook’s paper calls for global standards on internet regulation knowing of course that reaching a consensus between the USA, China and Europe on these issues will be impossible. Another clear tactic for trying to kick all of this into the long grass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook’s basic pitch on regulation is that social media companies should be required to have “systems in place” to deal with illegal and harmful content, but that these policies should be written and administered by them, the social media companies. In Zuckerberg’s ideal world, the only role for government regulation would be to ask Facebook about the existence of these policies without the power to fully audit them. If that’s what Zuckerberg has come to sell, he might as well have stayed in California.\n\nAt the heart of Facebook’s defence against the threat of regulation is the protection of freedom of speech. Yet, in his lecture at Georgetown University last year, Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that “even American tradition recognises that some speech infringes on others’ rights.” Facebook’s preferred method for dealing with content that might cause harm is to downgrade its prevalence, making it harder to find rather than removing it. This line of action seems to imply that people largely see new content because they search for it.\n\nIt’s an approach that ignores the impact of co-ordinated networks of Facebook groups with millions of users pushing content through the system, or the undercover economy of Facebook Page administrators promoting other people’s content at lower fees than the company itself charges through its advertising tools. Also, I don’t believe that freedom of speech is the same as freedom of reach. Someone might have the right to share their opinions, but they shouldn’t have the automatic right to hijack social media in order to broadcast them to millions of people, multiple times a day at the click of a button.\n\nThese issues require a more proactive response from Facebook, and it shouldn’t just be left to them. It should be for governments to establish clear legal liabilities for social media companies to act against harmful and illegal content when it is being curated through their systems, by their own algorithms.\n\nRead next The rank hypocrisy of Jeff Bezos' $690,000 donation to Australia The rank hypocrisy of Jeff Bezos' $690,000 donation to Australia\n\nThese new regulations need to be overseen by truly independent regulators with legal powers to inspect and audit the companies and ensure they are complying effectively. The UK government has set out its approach to this in the Online Harms White Paper, and other countries are now looking at similar measures. Once again, Facebook’s response has been to offer too little too late.\n\nDamian Collins is the MP for Folkestone & Hythe, and the former chair of the Commons Select Committee for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, where he oversaw the \"Fake News\" inquiry\n\nMore great stories from WIRED\n\n🏙️ A huge Airbnb scam is taking over London\n\n🚙 Thinking of buying an electric car?

The slowdown came after the current account deficit hit a five-month high at $555 million in January due to uptick in imports and downturn in exports and remittance inflows.\n\n“The surge in deficit is in line with expectation…it seems sustainable,” commented Taurus Securities Deputy Head of Research Mustafa Mustansir while talking to The Express Tribune.\n\nCumulatively, the deficit stood at $2.65 billion in seven months of FY20 compared to $9.47 billion in the same period of previous fiscal year, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported on Wednesday.\n\nA significant contraction in imports has so far remained the major factor behind the narrowing of the current account deficit as exports are yet to pick up momentum in dollar terms while workers’ remittances have remained steady.\n\n“Uptick in imports in January came after the government eased restrictions on the import of machinery and raw material in a bid to give a boost to economic activities,” Mustansir said.\n\nAlmost 60% of imports are meant for re-export from Pakistan. Therefore, imports will rise gradually as the authorities soften regulations to ramp up manufacturing and exports.\n\nEarlier, the central bank allowed commercial banks to make up to 50% advance payment for the import of machinery, plants and raw material in December and up to 100% in January.\n\nBesides, it announced an increase of Rs200 billion in subsidised loans for exporters and offered such loans to almost all the exporters compared to mostly textile exporters earlier.\n\nThe pace of contraction in the current account deficit will slow down gradually in the remaining five months of the current fiscal year. “The contraction will be somewhere between 55% and 60% in FY20 compared to 72% in the first seven months,” the analyst projected.\n\n“What is disappointing is that exports have failed to pick up pace despite a number of measures, including a massive 55% depreciation of the rupee against the dollar from January 2018 to June 2019, while remittances have also remained steady against earlier expectations for a notable growth of 10-11% in FY20,” he said.\n\nThe growth in exports and remittance inflows has so far remained sluggish mainly due to the global economic slowdown amid prolonged US-China trade tensions and now due to the outbreak of a deadly virus in mainland China, which had spread to over two-dozen countries around the world, he added.\n\n“Overall stability in international crude oil prices, however, remained beneficial for Pakistan,” he said. Pakistan’s economy heavily relies on imported petroleum oil products as it meets over 70% of demand through imports.\n\nImport of goods declined about 20% to $26.08 billion in the first seven months of FY20 compared to $32.48 billion in the same period of last year.\n\nExport of goods improved just 2.2% to $14.44 billion compared to $14.13 billion last year. Workers’ remittances rose 4.1% to $13.30 billion compared to $12.77 billion last year, according to the central bank. In January alone, the import of goods rose 2.7% to $3.91 billion compared to $2.10 billion in December. Export of goods dropped 2.7% to $2.05 billion compared to $2.10 billion. Workers’ remittances fell to $1.90 billion compared to $2.09 billion.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 20th, 2020.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\nRead full story"

United Kingdom leaving the European Union represented in puzzle pieces.\n\nEuropean Union leaders will clash this week over the EU’s 2021-2027 budget as Britain’s exit leaves a 75 billion euro ($81 billion) hole in the bloc’s finances just as it faces costly challenges such as becoming carbon neutral by 2050. The budget is the most tangible expression of key areas on which the EU members must focus over the next seven years and their willingness to stump up.\n\nFor the coming seven-year cycle, the starting point for talks is 1.074% of the bloc’s gross national income (GNI), or 1.09 trillion euros. By contrast, EU national budgets claw in 47% of annual output (GDP) on average. Still, disputes over hundredths of percentage points have kept EU and government officials busy for the last two years and many diplomats remain sceptical that a deal will be reached on Thursday and Friday, when leaders meet in Brussels.\n\n“Tomorrow’s summit is a complex and complicated summit because the proposal we have received does not meet our expectations”, said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Italy is one of the net contributors to the common EU pot.\n\nThe EU budget gets money from customs duties on goods entering its single market, a cut of sales tax, antitrust fines imposed by the EU on companies, and from national contributions. It spends money on subsidies for EU farmers, on equalising living standards across the bloc, border management, research, security and various non-EU aid programmes.\n\nSome net contributors – the “frugal four” of the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark – want to limit the budget to 1.00% of GNI. Germany, the biggest contributor, is prepared to accept a bit more, but 1.07 is too high for Berlin.\n\nCOHESION FUNDS\n\nThe European Commission has proposed 1.1% and the European Parliament, which will vote on the budget, wants 1.3%. For net beneficiaries such as Poland, larger is better.\n\nFor many central and eastern European countries, EU “cohesion funds” are crucial. “The costs related to Brexit and other challenges should be more equitably distributed,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki wrote in the Financial Times, adding this was not the case due to proposed deep cuts for cohesion policies and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). But with less money coming in because of Brexit, some net contributors argue there is simply less to share around. Also, more money should be spent to modernise the EU economy rather than on preserving agriculture, they say.\n\nEU leaders will discuss the idea of a tax on plastic waste that would go to EU coffers and sharing some profits from trading carbon emission permits.\n\nThe EU is also considering other taxes – on the digital economy, on flying, on financial transactions and on products made with high CO2 emissions imported into the EU. Commission officials warn time is running out and the EU risks starting next year with no money to protect its borders, finance research and fund student exchanges, or equalise standards of living.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "content": "When the Soviet Union began its collapse in 1989, the world witnessed decentralization and secession on a scale not seen in Europe since the nineteenth century.\n\nOver the next several years, puppet regimes and states-in-name-only broke away from Soviet domination and formed sovereign states. Some states which had completely ceased to exist—such as the Baltic states—declared independence and became states in the own right. In total, secession and decentralization in this era brought about more than twenty newly independent states.\n\nThis period served as an important reminder that human history is not, in fact, just a story of ever increasing state power and centralization.\n\nSince then, however, the world has seen very few successful secession movements. A handful of new countries have come into being over the past twenty years, such as East Timor and South Sudan. But in spite of many efforts by separatists worldwide, there have been few changes to the lines on the maps.\n\nThis has certainly been the case in Europe and the Americas, where from Quebec to Scotland to Catalonia to Venice demands for independence have been met with trepidation and sometimes outright threats of violence from central governments. Anatomy of the State Murray Rothbard Best Price: $5.00 Buy New $5.82 (as of 05:45 EST - Details)\n\nCountries Don’t Like to Get Smaller\n\nThis is partly due to the fact state organizations—that is, the people who control them—have little motivation to give up the benefits conferred by bigness. States that control larger geographic areas and larger populations have greater ability to project their power and get more power.\n\nGreater size means a larger frontier that can act as a physical buffer between the state’s enemies and the state’s economic core. Physical size is also helpful in terms of pursuing self-sufficiency in both energy production and agriculture. More land means greater potential for resource extraction and acreage devoted to food production. From the state’s perspective, these activities are good things because they can be taxed or expropriated.\n\nIn terms of population size, state control over larger populations means more human workers to tax, and, potentially, more highly productive urban workers. Historically at least, larger populations also provided personnel for military uses.\n\nThus, states that control large territories and populations are able to directly control larger and more diverse economies within their borders. This means more tax revenue, which in turn means greater military capability. Naturally, state organizations are not inclined to abandon these advantages lightly, even when secession movement express a desire that they do so.\n\nWhy States Sometimes Get Smaller\n\nSometimes, though, states are forced to contract in size and scope. This usually happens when the cost of maintaining the status quo becomes higher than the cost of allowing a region to gain autonomy.\n\nHistorically, the cost of maintaining unity is raised through military means. Examples of this tactic being successfully employed include the cases of the United States, the Republic of Ireland, and some of the successor states of Yugoslavia.\n\nBut secession and decentralization have also often been achieved through bloodless or near bloodless means. This was the case in Iceland and throughout most of the post-Iron Curtain states.\n\nBloodless secession movements, however, only occur when the parent state is weakened by larger events beyond the secession movement itself. Iceland, for example, seceded in 1944, when World War II ensured that Denmark was in no position to object. The post-Soviet states seceded when the Soviet state had been rendered impotent by decades of economic decline and (in 1991) a failed coup. Nor is it a coincidence that India gained independence from the United Kingdom in the years immediately following World War II. It is likely the UK could have held on to India through military means indefinitely, but this would have come at a very high cost to the British economy and standard of living.\n\nIt is possible to envision largely “amicable” separations. The model for this is the separation of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand from the the United Kingdom. But even in these cases, British control over these Commonwealth states’ foreign policy was not totally abandoned until after World War II, when the British state had been weakened by depression and war. Moreover, the British state assumed that these newly independent states would remain highly reliable geopolitical and economic allies indefinitely. Thus, the geopolitical cost of separation was perceived to be low.\n\nMega-States Are the Ideal State\n\nIn cases where the seceding state is perceived to have differing cultural, economic, or geopolitical interests—which is true of the overwhelming majority of cases—the parent state is, all else being equal, likely to meet demands for secession with much hostility.\n\nAlthough liberal ideology has diminished the perception among much of the world’s population that bigger is better, most government agents—who are by nature decidedly illiberal—see things differently. For them, the ideal state is most certainly a large state.\n\nThose who delight in the generous application of state violence have noticed that it is not a coincidence the world’s most powerful states—e.g., the US, Russia, China—are those that control large populations, large economic centers, and large geographic areas with sizable frontiers. The combination of these three factors in various configuration ensures that existential threats to the regime are few and far between. Russia’s relatively small economy—only a fraction of the size of Germany’s economy—is mitigated by its enormous geographical frontiers. Its economy is nonetheless large enough to maintain a nuclear arsenal. China’s per capita wealth is quite small, but Chinese territory and the sheer size of its overall economy ensures protection from foreign attack. The US’s enormous economy and its huge ocean frontiers render it essentially immune to all existential threats other than large-scale nuclear war.\n\nLarge states such as these are limited only by the defensive capabilities of other states, and by the threat of domestic unrest and resistance. As Ludwig von Mises noted in Liberalism, states can take only as much power as their populations are willing to give it. There are limits to the public’s generosity.\n\nTotalitarian States Require Bigness\n\nThis relationship between bigness and state power has been illustrated in the fact totalitarian states are virtually always large states.\n\nIn her book The Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt examines a number of nontotalitarian dictatorships that sprang up in Europe before the Second World War. These included (among others) the Baltic states, Hungary, Portugal, and Romania. In many of these cases, Arendt contends the regimes attempted to turn themselves into totalitarian regimes, but failed. This was largely due to their lack of size:\n\nAlthough [totalitarian ideology] had served well enough to organize the masses until the movement seized power, the absolute size of the country then forced the would-be totalitarian ruler of masses into the more familiar patterns of class or party dictatorship. The truth is that these countries simply did not control enough human material to allow for total domination and its inherent great losses in population. Without much hope for the conquest of more heavily populated territories, the tyrants in these small countries were forced into a certain old-fashioned moderation lest they lose whatever people they had to rule. This is also why Nazism, up to the outbreak of the war and its expansion over Europe, lagged so far behind its Russian counterpart in consistency and ruthlessness; even the German people were not numerous enough to allow for the full development of this newest form of government. Only if Germany had won the war would she have known a fully developed totalitarian rulership.\n\nArendt was not an economist, but had she been one, she might have noted that the necessity of size is so central to totalitarian regimes because they are so economically inefficient. Contrary to promises of machine-like efficiency made by advocates of ever more powerful states, totalitarian states are absurdly wasteful both in terms of capital and human life. The same is true—to varying extents—for all regimes. But as the most centrally-planned ones—whether totalitarian or not—quickly become economic basket cases, large size is necessary. A smaller state would quickly exhaust its capital and its population, and the regime would collapse. Size can provide the appearance of sustainability for longer.\n\nCultural factors cannot be ignored, however. Arendt concedes this process of collapse can be drawn out longer in societies that are more ideologically tolerant of it:\n\nConversely, the chances for totalitarian rule are frighteningly good in the lands of traditional Oriental despotism, in India and China…\n\nThat region’s relative tolerance for despotism is enabled by local ideologies that foster a “feeling of superfluousness,” which according to Arendt “has been prevalent for centuries in the contempt for the value of human life.”\n\nContinued Movement toward Smaller States\n\nThe Origins of Totalit... Hannah Arendt Best Price: $8.49 Buy New $12.90 (as of 06:35 EST - Details) Fortunately for humanity, the trend in the world today is toward smaller states. As numerous scholars have noted, the average number of states in the world is larger now than at any other time in recent centuries. Moreover, the rise of global trade has lessened the benefits of imperialism and expanding a state’s frontiers and population. As Mises observed, freedom in trade negates the need for a state to acquire more of the world’s wealth through militaristic or imperialistic methods. States often still seek economic “self-sufficiency,” but the cost of this is so high, and the benefits of open trade so enticing, that more states are willing to accept trade as a substitute for “lebensraum.” This can already be observed, as globalization has allowed small states to thrive, and small states have even acted to force greater discipline on large states through tax competition.\n\nThere are certainly exceptions to this. Some small states, such as North Korea, have maintained an economically isolationist and totalitarian stance—fueled both by internal paranoia and by real perennial threats issued by its enemies (especially the US), in the case of the latter. For the most part, however, the spread of markets (and promarket ideology) has raised the opportunity cost of militaristic expansion from the state’s perspective. If offered the chance to expand at low cost, though, virtually all regimes would take the opportunity in a heartbeat. And this is why we will likely continue to see regimes enthusiastically resist secession within their own borders. States don’t have many opportunities to expand their territories and populations. So they’re not about to sign off on secession lightly. Nevertheless, new economic realities, wars, and demographic shifts may certainly affect the equation in coming years. And then we may again see a redrawing of maps of a sort not seen since the end of the Cold War.\n\nNote: The views expressed on Mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute.\n\nThe Best of Ryan McMaken"

            "content": "( Foreign Policy in Focus) – Democratic candidates offer a wide range of foreign policy views. These won’t decide the election, but they could have a huge post-Trump impact.\n\nThe next presidential election will not likely hinge on foreign policy.\n\nAmericans will go to the polls in November to express their fervent support, or disgust, for Donald Trump. The candidates’ positions on the issues — on any issues — matter only to a dwindling number of voters who have somehow managed, over the last three years, to remain undecided about the current president’s fitness for higher office.\n\nOf course, people are still responding to the pollsters when asked what they care about going into the election. Health care ranks number one in recent Gallup and Harris polls. The economy remains at the top of the Pew surveys, with the environment climbing to the number two position. National security, particularly terrorism, hovers somewhere near the top of the rankings.\n\nBut how many Americans will actually make up their minds in November based on these issues? According to The New York Times, only about 9 percent of the electorate is “truly persuadable.” Geoffrey Skelley at FiveThirtyEight arrives at a similar number — somewhere between 7 and 9 percent.\n\nEven this number overstates the size of this sliver of the electorate. The last election was decided in the Electoral College by a relatively small number of voters in three swing states. So, the “truly persuadables” of California or Oklahoma will be indistinguishable in the blue or red wave. Only the undecided voters in places like Florida and Wisconsin will matter.\n\nThese undecided swing-state supervoters, who hold the fate of the nation in their hands, might not care about anything except, ultimately, the personality of the candidates. The issues that matter to them will likely be domestic: health care or the state of the economy. Unless Trump starts a war between now and November — which is not impossible, given his impulsiveness — foreign policy will not decide this election.\n\nStill, it’s important to look at how the candidates consider the U.S. role in the world to understand what will happen after November. I’ve spent the last three years evaluating Trump’s erratic foreign policy: his militarism, his irrational trade policy, his war on migrants. If he gets reelected, expect four more years of nonstop aggression. It’s a terrifying prospect.\n\nIf Trump gets booted in November, he will leave behind considerable wreckage. How do the Dems propose to clean up this mess?\n\nStatus Quo Ante?\n\nThe Democrats offer such a wide range of options when it comes to foreign policy that they really represent three distinct parties. Dismayed by how far to the right the party of Trump has gone, you can back a moderate Republican in the person of Mike Bloomberg. With Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, you can opt for a Democratic version of “the Blob,” Washington’s foreign policy consensus. Or you could veer to the left and embrace Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.\n\nOf course, with Trump as the reference point, all the Democrats share a family resemblance when it comes to foreign policy. They all acknowledge the threat of climate change, want to revive U.S. diplomacy, and promise to smooth over relations with allies. Any one of them would repair some of the damage of the Trump years.\n\nBut the damage goes deeper than what Trump has wrought. So, a return to the “good old days” of the Obama years — with its expanded drone attacks, failed negotiations with North Korea, and corporate-friendly trade deals — won’t be sufficient. With that in mind, let’s look at the Democratic line-up, beginning with the man who is closest to Trump in temperament and views: Mike Bloomberg.\n\nAs a billionaire, a former Republican, and a fiscal conservative, Bloomberg is the textbook middle-of-the-road option. In some ways, President Bloomberg would not alter Trump’s foreign policy. He’s a fierce defender of Saudi Arabia, for instance, and continues to believe that its leader Mohammad bin Salman is the face of reform. Bloomberg is also a big booster of Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu in particular. Like Trump, the media mogul has a fondness for Xi Jinping and doesn’t consider him a dictator.\n\nDespite his credentials as a fiscal conservative, Bloomberg wouldn’t cut the military budget, which reflects his innate hawkishness. And he has no problem increasing surveillance of Americans and non-Americans alike.\n\nOn the other hand, Bloomberg supports rejoining the Iran nuclear deal without preconditions. He has poured a tremendous amount of his own money into battling the fossil fuel industry and promoting clean energy alternatives. He also wants to boost, not cut, immigration rates. He wouldn’t wage costly trade wars with China or America’s allies.\n\nIn other words, Bloomberg represents what the Republican Party might have looked like if it had evolved from the Yankee conservatism of George H.W. Bush instead of going off on the ruthless trajectory of the neoconservatives in the 2000s and the neopopulists under Trump. Bloomberg offers a version of Nixonian realpolitik with a green coating. He’s the kind of telegenic authoritarian that the chattering classes criticize but ultimately tolerate.\n\nPete Buttigieg has positioned himself as the most cosmopolitan of the candidates, the one who has studied abroad, served in the military overseas, and speaks a smattering of languages. Like Bill Clinton, he can code-switch between small-town American boyishness and Oxbridge sophistication.\n\nIn his first major foreign policy speech in July, Buttigieg offered five pretty good proposals: rejoin the Iran deal and the Paris climate accord, repeal and replace the Authorization for Use of Military Force, block assistance to Israel if it annexes the West Bank, and invest in renewable energy. In general, Buttigieg is firmly pro-Israel, but he at least is willing to break with the AIPAC line when it comes to saying yes to everything Benjamin Netanyahu wants.\n\nUltimately, however, Buttigieg is a younger, hipper version of the Blob. As Michael Brenes explains in The New Republic:\n\nOn close examination, Buttigieg’s foreign policy departs very little from the suburban-friendly centrism of his domestic plans. His ideas are of a piece with those of previous Democratic presidential candidates who have sought to project military strength and entrusted U.S. strategy to an inherently hawkish establishment of national security experts. Despite the salutary rhetoric, plenty of evidence suggests a Buttigieg presidency would likely extend the forever war rather than terminate it.\n\nAmy Klobuchar falls into roughly the same category as Buttigieg, both of them trying to navigate a centrist position among the crowded field of candidates. She wants to get tough with China on economic relations and human rights, but also end the current trade war. She says she supports the Green New Deal, but also favors nuclear energy. She has supported an expansion of drone strikes but says she wants more transparency. She supports the Iran nuclear deal but calls Iran one of the two biggest threats to the United States.\n\nIn other words, she’s an ace triangulator. But she’s also perhaps the least experienced candidate on foreign policy, as her failure to name Mexico’s president in a recent interview reveals.\n\nThe Biden Alternative\n\nIt’s instructive to examine Joe Biden’s current Foreign Affairs piece in light of what the more popular Buttigieg, Bloomberg, and Klobuchar are offering. Biden is an unexciting candidate in many ways, and he has suffered recent setbacks in Iowa and New Hampshire. A poor showing in South Carolina — indeed, anything except an outright victory there — will probably put the nomination beyond his grasp.\n\nStill, Biden has presented himself as the most experienced foreign policy candidate and remains a key party insider, so his views will be influential even if he falls far back in the pack.\n\nHis Foreign Affairs essay is entitled “Why America Must Lead Again,” which suggests the usual American exceptionalism. However, Biden leads not with military strength but with defense of democracy, rolling back Trump’s egregious immigration policies, and rooting out corruption.\n\n“Democracies — paralyzed by hyperpartisanship, hobbled by corruption, weighed down by extreme inequality — are having a harder time delivering for their people,” he writes. He pledges to pull together a Summit for Democracy in his first year focused on “fighting corruption, defending against authoritarianism, and advancing human rights in their own nations and abroad.” That’s a good idea that all the candidates should endorse.\n\nBiden recasts trade policy as a “foreign policy for the middle class,” which translates into trade deals with labor and environmental provisions along with strong enforcement mechanisms. And he emphasizes diplomacy, not military force — ending the “forever wars,” ending U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, negotiating deals with adversaries, going back to the table on climate change.\n\nIn fact, with its emphases on democracy, fair trade, and military restraint, Biden’s article is virtually indistinguishable from Elizabeth Warren’s own Foreign Affairs essay from one year earlier.\n\nThis reflects two things: a progressive shift in the mainstream of the Democratic Party and an inherited frustration with the Blob. Biden’s essay would have made a fine Nobel Prize speech instead of what Obama actually delivered, which was a measured defense of just war.\n\nHowever, Biden is largely interested in restoring U.S. foreign policy to what existed prior to Trump, but with a certain naivete about the influence of the Blob. As such, it’s what Biden doesn’t say that’s perhaps more telling than what he does. For instance, he has little to say about the use of military force beyond the usual bromides about maintaining U.S. military superiority and resorting to the Pentagon only as a final option.\n\nAnd that brings us to the progressive alternatives.\n\nMoving Forward, Not Backward\n\nRewinding U.S. foreign policy to December 2016 would be an enormous step forward. Ending Trump’s racist immigration policies, putting the nuclear button (and all other military buttons) as far from his fingers as possible, restoring a modicum of predictability to U.S. relations with allies, and rejoining key international agreements: that’s all worth supporting.\n\nBut Trump’s 2016 victory is also a reminder that the status quo is much more fragile than anyone ever expected. In office, Trump has skewered several important foreign policy certainties: that you just can’t meet with someone like Kim Jong Un, that you can’t walk away from a multilateral trade agreement, that you can’t reassign Pentagon funds to some other mission.\n\nDemocrats would do well to remember that the Blob has a Wizard of Oz quality. It speaks with the deep voice of authority, but it has no real public legitimacy. The average American is much more willing to consider radical changes in U.S. global posture than the Blob would countenance.\n\nSo, when progressives like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren talk about significant reductions in military spending — something that Bloomberg rejects and Biden sidesteps — it’s not so unfeasible as many pundits claim.\n\nLet’s start with Sanders. If you look at the key points of his foreign policy, they’re not that different from Biden’s. His commitment to democracy and human rights even leads a centrist commentator like Jackson Diehl to give Sanders a cautious thumb’s up on foreign policy (which is, in turn, a corrective to the Washington Post article claiming that Sanders would “upend America’s global role”).\n\nSanders is not an isolationist. He is simply (and rightly) skeptical of U.S. military interventions. He doesn’t just talk about the military as a last resort but wants to adjust U.S. spending priorities to ensure that the Pentagon no longer has a disproportionate effect on U.S. foreign policy. How much is he willing to cut? Perhaps wisely, he hasn’t talked about a specific figure, preferring to focus on misplaced budget priorities:\n\nThe time is long overdue for us to take a hard look at military spending, including the “war on terror,” and whether it makes sense to spend trillions more on endless wars, wars that often cause more problems than they solve. Call me a radical, but maybe before funding a new space force, we should make sure no American goes bankrupt because of a medical bill or dies because they can’t afford to go to a doctor on time.\n\nElizabeth Warren has been more specific about Pentagon budget cuts, and that has made her a more convenient target. In her detailed health care plan, she proposed cutting $800 billion from the military budget over 10 years. That might sound like a lot, and as a result, Washington Post columnist Henry Olsen called her a more terrifying choice than Trump.\n\nBut a reduction of $80 billion a year wouldn’t even restore the Pentagon to Obama-era levels. In 2015, military spending was $586 billion. By 2019, it had grown to $716 billion, and Trump now wants to push it to $740 billion. So, just returning to Obama-level spending, not taking into consideration the rate of inflation, would require something much closer to a $150 billion cut, nearly twice what Warren proposes.\n\nNeither Sanders nor Warren has offered anything truly transformational akin to a Global Green New Deal (as opposed to the domestic GND that Sanders touts), a new set of institutions to govern the global economy (a New Bretton Woods), or some fundamentally different way of engaging China and Russia. Although Warren’s catchphrase has been “I have a plan for that,” it hasn’t applied to foreign policy. As for Sanders, his Eurocentrism has prevented him from offering anything truly global in scope.\n\nLooking Elsewhere\n\nFortunately, other progressives are making bold proposals that the eventual Democratic presidential candidate can raise up. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) recently laid out a package of seven bills that would truly restore the United States to a leadership position in the world — through ethical action rather than stirring rhetoric or (worse) military/economic hegemony.\n\nTwo of Omar’s proposals are simple, imperative, and yet impossible without the Democrats winning a commanding margin in the Senate: ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (the United States is the only country that hasn’t signed it) and re-signing and ratifying participation in the International Criminal Court.\n\nA third bill, which would prohibit any security assistance to human-rights-abusing countries, is well worth considering. But it would encounter considerable resistance since the top recipients, Israel and Egypt, would face immediate scrutiny and their U.S. supporters would balk.\n\nThree other proposals could attract bipartisan support. One would provide congressional oversight of any economic sanctions the executive branch wants to impose. A second would push the United States to take leadership on a global migration pact at the UN. A third would internationalize the YouthBuild program, which helps disadvantaged youth get the education and job training they need.\n\nThe final bill in the series, the Global Peacebuilding Act, is particularly visionary. Instead of diverting $5 billion from the Pentagon to build the Wall, this legislation would transfer $5 billion from the Pentagon’s fund for fighting overseas wars into a multilateral Global Peacebuilding Fund. Such an elegant use of Trump’s own stratagem could attract support from many Democrats and even some Republicans.\n\nWill any of this make a difference in November?\n\nIt’s likely that anyone who would spend the time and energy to parse the foreign policy differences among all the candidates has already made up their mind about Trump. Moreover, what will win the presidential election is power, not policy: power of rhetoric, but more importantly power on the ground.\n\nAnd there’s one more element. Particularly with his foreign policy, Trump has gradually whittled his base of support down to the nativists, those who despise “shithole” countries, who want nothing but larger walls, who want to quarantine the United States from foreign influences of all sorts. Trump’s rivals, by offering a more inclusive global vision, could motivate a larger turnout among the foreign born and the larger diaspora communities.\n\nPerhaps in this way, at least, foreign policy can play a pivotal role in the election where it counts: getting out the vote.\n\nVia Foreign Policy in Focus\n\n—-\n\nBonus Video added by Informed Comment:\n\nKPIX CBS SF Bay Area: “Dem.

Didn’t they know that a vote for Brexit would, in itself, lead to 500,000 more job losses? Couldn’t they see that Nissan was bound to wind down its operations in Sunderland and move business to mainland Europe?\n\nAlmost four years on, it’s safe to say that most of the economic doom-mongering was nonsense. This week’s figures on jobs and earnings show that, since the referendum, employment is up by one million — and it is rising still. Unemployment in the UK is at its lowest since 1974. Unemployment in Wales is at its lowest since records began. Leaked internal reports from Nissan have revealed that, if the current round of Brexit talks fail, it could move production of Micras from France to Sunderland, aiming to capture a bigger share of the UK market.\n\nThis week’s figures also explain why Jeremy Corbyn failed to gain any traction with his idea of an exploited ‘zero hours Britain’ suffering at the bottom of a ‘widening gap between rich and poor’. It simply isn’t true that low-paid workers have fared worse than others. At the lower end of the income scale, earnings are growing faster than average — pushing income inequality towards a 30-year low. Welfare reform has helped move more people into work.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sharp rise in the National Living Wage, which will soon be one of the highest in the world, has helped this along. The bottom third of full-time employees received an above-average pay rise of 4 per cent. The bottom 5 per cent of part-time workers did even better, with an annual pay increase of 11 per cent. Employment figures, meanwhile, show how wrong William Hague’s Conservatives (and the CBI) were to oppose Tony Blair’s introduction of the minimum wage — and how right the Conservatives have been in recent years to embrace it. Far from the minimum wage destroying jobs, employment is at a record high. Work is paying more — and thanks to a steep rise in the personal tax allowance, it’s a lot more.\n\nA further revealing statistic published by the ONS this week puts paid to another assertion which has been made repeatedly over the past three and a half years: that a vote for Brexit would lead to an exodus of EU nationals. In fact, the number working in Britain over the past 12 months has increased by 36,000 to 2.31 million. The number of non-EU foreign nationals working here has climbed by 49,000 to 1.34 million. There are significantly more Italian, French, Greek and Spanish students studying here than before the referendum.\n\nSuch facts tends not to be reported very widely. Even now, when progress is reported, it is often presented as a baffling anomaly — the assumption being that Brexit should have plunged Britain into agony. ‘UK created jobs at pace… despite Brexit,’ said the Irish Times this week. Standard & Poor’s reported that the UK last year saw more private equity deals than any other European country, ‘despite Brexit uncertainty’. Reuters announced that Japanese banks are engaged in a ‘London rehiring spree, despite Brexit’. Forbes magazine surpassed itself, revealing that ‘Despite Brexit, English remains the EU’s most spoken language by far’ — with 44 per cent of Europeans speaking English, far more than the second most popular language (German).\n\nOf course, Brexit was never going to threaten any of these things. Britain’s economic prospects have not been smashed by our leaving the European Union — if anything, it’s a better time to invest in Britain than ever before. It might take a while for those who predicted disaster to understand this. Until they do, we will have to contend with two parallel universes: the real one, in which the economy has been growing, along with employment and wages; and the imagined one, featured in so many of the headlines, in which Britain is still trapped in recession and a low-wage spiral.\n\nNext year, when we will be released from EU rules, there will be more changes. A new immigration system will make it harder for unskilled workers to enter Britain — and we can expect some grumbling. Employers might have to pay more, or do more to train employees. Care homes who say they struggle to attract British staff may have to raise their salaries to something more befitting a job as important as caring for the elderly. Manufacturers who have skimped on investment (making Britain one of the least automated countries in the developed world) might now have to remedy this and equip their staff for higher-skilled work.\n\nFor a decade, from 2008, Britain endured the longest wage slump in history. But in the past year or two, a recovery has started — and Tory fortunes have also picked up. The last general election was, of course, an instruction to the government to get\n\nBrexit done and turn the page. But it was also a reminder that voters are likely to reward an administration that can push wages up and taxes down. As the government prepares to deliver the Budget, that’s something worth remembering."

            "content": "Whatever you think of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s undergraduate politics, you have to admit the former Bronx bartender has more charisma than all the Democratic presidential candidates put together.\n\nAt Bernie Sanders’ packed rallies in Iowa and New Hampshire, she always stole the show.\n\nTapping the 30-year-old Democratic Socialist as his sidekick after his heart attack in October was the smartest thing he’s done. She has sent his poll numbers soaring and helps “Bernie Bros” feel they are part of a dynamic millennial movement, not the last gasp of a worn out 78-year-old socialist.\n\nWednesday, when AOC appeared on ABC’s “The View,” her star power shone brighter than her sequined dress.\n\nShe was there to laud Sanders as a fighter for “people like us . . . working families . . . He wants a political revolution at the ballot box.”\n\nBut AOC also is using Sanders as a vehicle for the most dangerous idea to hit those unsuspecting working families: the Green New Deal.\n\nHer pet project, which she launched in February 2019, a month after assuming office, is a multitrillion-dollar, zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions plan aimed at redistributing wealth and radically transforming the American economy.\n\nHer former chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, admitted last year, in a conversation reported by The Washington Post, that the Green New Deal “wasn’t originally a climate thing at all, [but] a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.”\n\nNow Sanders has adopted it as the centerpiece of his climate agenda, and the other candidates aren’t far behind.\n\nIn just 12 months, what was an unthinkably extreme restructure of the American economy has moved into the mainstream of Democratic policy.\n\nThat’s quite some achievement for the fresh-faced freshman representative.\n\n“This is our World War II,” she said. “We call for a national, social industrial and economic mobilization not seen since World War II . . . It’s inevitable that we can use the transition to 100 percent renewable energy as the vehicle to truly deliver and establish economic, social and racial justice in America.”\n\nDanger, Will Robinson.\n\nSanders and the other Democratic candidates are on board because they say climate change is an “existential crisis.” They promise to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, lock the country into zero emissions by 2045 (Tom Steyer) or 2050 (Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg), close down fossil-fuel industries and endorse some form of carbon tax which will jack up energy bills for every American. So much for “working families.”\n\nBloomberg, new to the stage, has ruled out the Green New Deal as a vote-killer (no kidding), but has previously called for a carbon tax and bankrolled efforts to shut down fossil fuel plants.\n\nEven if you buy the climate-apocalypse claim, anyone who reads the Paris agreement, from which President Trump wisely extracted us, would see the true agenda in its preamble. It is a grab bag of social causes, including “climate justice,” “efforts to eradicate poverty,” “the rights of indigenous peoples, migrants . . . gender equality, empowerment of women” and “intergenerational equity.”\n\nThis is a social-engineering project which has nothing to do with fresh air or clean water and everything to do with controlling how we live.\n\nIts guiding principle is “equity,” which is another word for the disastrous socialist goal of “equality of outcome,” achieved by a massive wealth transfer from rich to poor nations.\n\nAnd even if every nation, including China, were to abide by the Paris agreement, Earth’s temperature would be reduced by less than 0.2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, according to Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers. At a cost of $1 trillion to $2 trillion a year.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how charismatic the salesman, the Green New Deal is a fraud.\n\nMike buys his backers\n\nHere’s a glimpse of what Michael Bloomberg’s billions buy.\n\nLast week, when the tiny technocrat was fending off accusations of sexism, racism and downright heartlessness, endorsements flooded in from women and people of color.\n\nOne was from Georgia Rep. Lucy Kay McBath, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus: “Mike Bloomberg is the kind of fighter we need in the White House . . . I’m proud to stand with him in this race.”\n\nJob well done. But turns out Bloomberg spent $115 million to elect McBath and 20 other Democrats in 2018.\n\nHe boasted about it in December: “I supported . . . 21 winning candidates in the mid-terms. One of them was Lucy McBath . . . I got to know Lucy through an organization I helped found called Everytown for Gun Safety.”\n\nAnd therein lies a legal problem, according to Adam Laxalt, outside counsel for public ethics watchdog Americans for Public Trust, which last week filed complaints against McBath and two other Democrats with the Office of Congressional Ethics and the Federal Election Commission.\n\nMcBath was the paid national spokesperson for Everytown when she filed to run for Congress on March 5, 2018, says Laxalt. One week later, she appeared on CNN both as spokesperson for Everytown and a candidate. Wearing two hats is a breach of FEC “coordinated communication” rules which require a 120-day “cooling off” period between roles.\n\nIn April 2018, McBath took a “leave of absence” from Everytown, which subsequently endorsed her and spent more than $4 million on her campaign, money the APT alleges constitutes illegal campaign contributions.\n\n“The law is there because if you could coordinate a congressional candidate with a group with unlimited [funds], then federal spending limits would not exist,” says Laxalt, a former Nevada attorney general. “Everytown spent more than anyone [else] in that race so that’s a huge benefit to her campaign . . . “I know of no other examples where someone has gone from an outside dark-money group into a congressional race in the same cycle.”\n\nLaxalt says the breach is “especially alarming” because McBath sits on the House Judiciary Committee with oversight over the Justice Department.\n\nMcBath’s Republican incumbent rival Karen Handel, who lost her seat by just 1 percent, is still sore: “What Lucy neglects to mention is that she is bought and paid for by Michael Bloomberg and Democrat special interests,” she tweeted after McBath endorsed Bloomberg.\n\nA billionaire with such political influence is the very definition of an oligarch."

            "content": "Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited have expressed concern about the recent directive issued by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to revise the policy on SIM card registration and usage.\n\nThey firm noted that the directive if implemented, would have a neutral effect on telecoms companies' earnings in the near-term, adding that there were also risks to the long-term earnings potential of the telecoms operating companies (Telcos).\n\nPantami, had in the directive, stated that the policy reversal was based on the need to combat the spate of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nAssessing the minister's directive, Cordros Securities stated that SIM card ownership limits were commonplace across the world, especially in developing countries.\n\nIt however said with a three SIM limit, Nigeria would likely fall in line with Cuba, Lebanon and Singapore, adding that it was unclear if there would be exemptions for corporates with large numbers of SIMs registered, since revenues from corporates made up about 12 per cent of MTNs revenue in 2019.\n\nLooking at the neutral impact and risks of the directive on telecoms business, the report stated: \"We see the NIN stipulation as a risk to mobile money adoption and potential revenues expected to reach $889 million by 2023 for telcos, and financial inclusion targets of 95 per cent by 2024 for the government.\n\n\"The unbanked population of about 60 million, which is the target of mobile money services, will be most affected by the NIN stipulation due to the significant challenges surrounding registration process.\"\n\nThe report further stated that the first directive was not new, with NCC stating this as far back as October 2019.\n\nIt however said enforcement had been weak, with customers still given the option of using any of the range of \"National IDs\" to register.\n\nThe second stipulation, however, \"is where our concern lies. Although the NIMC Act was passed in 2007, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), the body in charge of issuing NINs and maintaining the database, was not established until 2010.\"\n\n\"Worse-still, the commencement date for the enforcement of the NIN was on 1 January 2019, six years after the initial SIM registration process ended.\n\n\"This implies majority of all registered SIMs in the country do not have NINs attached. Mandating that all SIMs are updated with the NIN effectively re-starts the entire SIM registration process from square one, especially if done in the same manner as the initial phase,\" the report added.\n\nPart of the directive, which was signed by the Technical Assistant on Information Technology to the Minister, Dr. Femi Adeluyi, had stated: \"This is in line with the Powers of the Minister as stated in Section 25(1) of the Nigerian Communications Act 2003- the Minister shall, in writing, from time to time notify the Commission or and express his views on the general policy direction of the federal government in respect of the communications sector.\n\n\"The revision of the Policy was based on the feedback received from the security agencies following the successful revalidation of improperly registered SIM cards in September 2019 and the blocking of those that failed to revalidate their SIMs.\"\n\nThe policy was expected to include provisions such as: Ensure that the National Identity Number (NIN) becomes a prerequisite for Nigerians registering new SIM cards, while for foreigners, their passports and visas should be used, while already registered SIM cards are to be updated with National Identity Number (NIN) before December 1, 2020; ensure that only fully accredited agents support the SIM card registration process without pre-registering SIM cards themselves, while the eventual registration should be done by the operators; there should be a maximum number of SIM cards that can be tied to a single individual, possibly a maximum of three; ensure that no unregistered SIMs are ever allowed on mobile networks; ensure that subscribers can easily check the number of SIM cards registered to their name, along with the associated phone numbers and networks.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Nigeria Business ICT By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

The Minister ordered NCC to provide him with the progress reports on the implementation of the revised policy."

            "content": "China reported a dramatic drop in new cases in the province at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, while scientists reported the new virus may spread even more easily than previously believed.\n\nChina's central Hubei province had 349 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, down from 1,693 a day earlier and lowest since January 25. The death toll rose by 108, down from 132 the previous day, bringing to total in China to over 2,100 deaths and 74,000 cases.\n\nThe new figures include subtracting 279 cases in the province that were not confirmed, a larger-than-usual number. No explanation was given. Excluding the deductions, the number of new cases on Wednesday stood at 628, still a large drop.\n\nChina is struggling to get its economy back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year.\n\nBeyond mainland China, six people have died from the disease, and governments around the world are trying to prevent it from spreading into a global pandemic.\n\nAustralia's Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) said on Thursday it will ground the equivalent of 18 planes, freeze recruitment and ask its 30,000 staff to use up annual leave as it grapples with falling demand from Asia due to the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nScientists published on Wednesday preliminary findings in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested the virus spreads easily, including through patients who have no symptoms.\n\n\"If confirmed, this is very important,\" said Dr. Greg Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved with the study.\n\nHEADING HOME\n\nHundreds of passengers trundled off a cruise ship in Japan on Wednesday after being held on board in quarantine for more than two weeks, as criticism mounted of Japan's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nEven as passengers rolled their luggage off the Diamond Princess cruise liner, Japanese authorities announced 79 new cases had been discovered on board, bringing the total to at least 620, well over half of the known cases outside mainland China.\n\nThe Diamond Princess has been quarantined near Tokyo since Feb. 3, initially with about 3,700 people aboard. The rapid spread of the disease on board led to criticism of the Japanese authorities just months before Japan is due to host the Olympics.\n\nFrom Wednesday, passengers who tested negative and showed no symptoms were free to leave. Around 500 were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with the rest of those eligible leaving over the next two days. Confirmed cases were to be sent to hospital, while those who shared cabins with infected passengers may still be kept on board.\n\nAround half of the passengers and crew are Japanese, and are free to go home once cleared to leave. Other countries, including Canada, have said they will fly passengers home and quarantine them on arrival. The United States flew more than 300 passengers to air bases in California and Texas this week.\n\n\"I am very keen to get off this ship,\" Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters over a social-media link. She was among a group of Australians catching an evacuation flight back to 14 days of quarantine in the city of Darwin.\n\n\"COMPLETELY INADEQUATE\"\n\nInfectious disease specialist Kentaro Iwata of Japan's Kobe University Hospital, who volunteered to help aboard the ship, described the infection control effort as \"completely inadequate\" and said basic protocols had not been followed.\n\n\"There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship and there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as a professional. The bureaucrats were in charge of everything,\" he said in a YouTube video.\n\nHealth Minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan's efforts.\n\n\"Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases,\" Kato said in a report by state broadcaster NHK.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan's efforts \"may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship.\"\n\nClyde and Renee Smith, 80-year-old American cruise passengers hospitalized in Japan since testing positive for the virus on Feb. 3, learned on Wednesday they were still positive.\n\n\"We are very happy here,\" Clyde said from the couple's hospital room in western Tokyo. \"They're taking excellent care of us. This is the newest, fanciest hospital I've ever seen.\"\n\nFrom the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers were not confined to rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as passengers were being screened, events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class.\n\nAlso read: Shashi Tharoor says he has cough and cold; Twitterati tell him to check for coronavirus\n\nAlso read: What's the impact of coronavirus outbreak on India?

            "content": "BENGALURU (Reuters) - The impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China on U.S. economic growth will be negligible and short-lived, according to economists in a Reuters poll who nonetheless now say risks to their forecasts are skewed more to the downside.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A customer counts her money at the register of a Toys R Us store on the Thanksgiving Day holiday in Manchester, New Hampshire November 22, 2012. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi\n\nThe outbreak has also significantly increased the chance Beijing doesn’t comply with all of the terms of a Jan. 15 initial trade agreement signed with Washington, potentially reigniting a damaging trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nStill, medians from the Feb. 10-19 Reuters poll of over 100 economic forecasters found the overall U.S. economic growth outlook for this year unchanged compared with last month.\n\nThe forecast for growth in the current quarter was reduced just 0.1 percentage point to a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 1.5% - already slow, even by recent standards. The economy was then expected to grow 1.8-2.0% each quarter until end-2021.\n\n“At this point, we are assuming the coronavirus impact will be relatively small, and more importantly, temporary. So whatever drag there is in the first quarter will largely be reversed in the second,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities.\n\n“It will not have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. But that is certainly a risk for sure. I mean, that is the source to downside risk if it keeps escalating.”\n\nGrowth is expected to pick up to 1.8% in the second quarter of this year, only slightly slower than the 1.9% forecast in the January poll.\n\nIn that survey, which was conducted before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global public health emergency, 56% of economists said the risks to their U.S. growth views were more to the upside.\n\nHowever, as the outbreak spread, that has switched around to nearly 70%, or 33 of 48 respondents now saying the opposite. Around 75,000 people have been reported as carriers of the virus globally, with over 2,000 confirmed dead.\n\nU.S. economic outlook here\n\nDespite these risks, the likelihood of a U.S. recession in the coming year only edged up to a median 23% from 20% in January.\n\n“The threat the coronavirus outbreak poses in an environment of already subdued global growth underlines the potential for medium-term U.S. economic weakness,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\n\n“It is impossible to forecast the path of the virus, but it increases the chances the Federal Reserve will cut rates at least once more to provide some support to the economy.”\n\nWhile the consensus showed the Fed would keep rates unchanged at 1.50%-1.75% at least until the end of next year, Reuters analysis showed nearly 40% of economists polled now expect at least one rate cut at some point this year.\n\n“We think the Fed will keep rates on hold, but we agree with the market that there are asymmetric risks to policy where easing is more likely than tightening,” said Michelle Meyer, U.S. economist at BofA Global Research.\n\n“With underlying economic data remaining robust, core inflation trending higher and policy already accommodative, there is a higher hurdle to cut this year than last.”\n\nThe poll found that inflation as measured by the core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred gauge, would range between 1.8% and 1.9% until the second quarter of next year and touch the central bank’s 2% target in the second half of 2021.\n\nWhen asked if the chance of non-compliance by Beijing with the terms of the initial trade agreement had increased significantly since the coronavirus outbreak, nearly two-thirds of economists, 30 of 48, said yes.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A woman shops at The Grove mall in Los Angeles November 26, 2013. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThat stands in contrast to results from a separate poll last week on the hit to China’s economy, in which about 56% of economists said the chance of non-compliance had not increased.\n\n“If domestic activity in China remains severely negatively affected by the outbreak of the virus, in our eyes, it’s highly likely the Chinese would try to reduce the purchases of U.S. goods they have promised,” said Bernd Weidensteiner at Commerzbank.\n\n“There is actually a paragraph in the Phase 1 agreement that in case of natural disasters...there is a way to purchase less than the promised amount, and they have a reason now that they cannot fully live up to their commitments, which are relatively generous,” he added."

            "content": "A ballot initiative has been proposed in San Diego that would serve to ban the sale of new gas vehicles costing over $50,000 starting next year. The initiative would also add a 2.5% tax on any gas vehicles over $50k that are purchased outside of the city and registered within city limits.\n\nA new organization called Breathe Free America has been formed to circulate the petition for the ballot initiative, which they’ve dubbed the “Clean Vehicle Initiative.” They are looking to gather 76,000 signatures from San Diegans in order to get it on the ballot.\n\nSan Diego is a great place to have an electric car. It’s one of the largest electric car markets in the country (just behind California’s Silicon Valley area), and there’s a lot of state government and utility support making electric car ownership more attractive.\n\nIt also happens to have the highest solar penetration of any city in the US, making electric car energy generation completely emissions-free for homeowners with solar panels. But San Diego has issues with air quality, due to its spread-out nature requiring many vehicle miles to get from place to place. The San Diego metro area has the sixth worst ozone pollution in the country, so it’s going to take some work to clean things up.\n\nSo Breathe Free America has proposed that San Diego be the first in America to implement a (partial) ban on gas vehicles.\n\nA lot of cities and countries around the globe have considered ICE car bans lately. Especially within cities, pollution is a real problem: It harms public health, it makes everything dirty, and it reduces economic productivity to have a bunch of gas cars idling.\n\nSo cities have considered bans or other measures to reduce gasoline usage, particularly in the densest downtown areas. This is happening in Rome, Reykjavik, and around Germany, among other places.\n\nLarger regions are working on the problem, too. The UK just pushed their nationwide gas car sales ban up by five years to 2035 (and they might even go further than that). The Netherlands wants to ban the use of gas vehicles in the country by 2030.\n\nMost of these bans are probably still not as strong as they should be, considering the problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels to our health, our climate, and to the world economy.\n\nBut so far, these bans haven’t come to US cities. There have been rumblings of California possibly wanting to ban gas cars by 2040, and Seattle and Los Angeles have signed the C40 Fossil-Fuel-Free streets declaration, pledging to “ensure a major area of the city is zero emission by 2030.”\n\nLike most similar bans, the proposed San Diego initiative applies only to new cars — those manufactured after January 1, 2021. Unlike most other bans, which tend to target around 2030 or later, it goes into effect much earlier.\n\nBut it’s not a real “ban” on all gas cars, as it only bans more expensive cars, and applies a relatively small tax to cars that are sold outside of the city. Breathe Free America says this will generate up to $30 million for the city.\n\nThere are also lots of exceptions — commercial vehicles, construction equipment, and vehicles modified for people with disabilities would be exempt from the law, among other categories.\n\nThe idea still has a long way to go before it would become law. First, 76,000 signatures must be collected. Then there would be a campaign, with inevitable pushback from wealthy fossil-fuel interests and local car dealers. Finally it would come down to an up-or-down vote by San Diegans — not the city council, but rather city residents.\n\nYou can read the full text of the proposed initiative here.\n\nIf you’re interested in keeping up to date on this measure or giving it your support, you can learn more about Breathe Free America on their “Join Us” page. They’ll start gathering signatures around the San Diego area starting in March, 20 days after publishing the text of the measure in local newspapers (which will happen this weekend).\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Trump specifically mentioned low unemployment rates for minority communities, women and veterans.\n\nHe also focused on the U.S. military’s erosion ISIS's territorial control, touting the successful operation against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his administration’s controversial strike against Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nAnd he promoted his administration’s policies on immigration, trade and healthcare, seeking to draw a stark contrast with Democrats.\n\n“At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation,” Trump said. “This election is so important.”\n\nThe president also fleetingly criticized House Democrats over his impeachment, decrying it as a “hoax” and an attempt to “nullify your ballots.” At one point, the president labeled Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDon't let 'welfare for all' advocates derail administration's food stamp program reforms Hillicon Valley: Officials worry about Nevada caucus technology after Iowa | Pelosi joins pressure campaign on Huawei | Workers at Kickstarter vote to unionize | Bezos launches B climate initiative Pelosi joins pressure campaign on Huawei MORE (D-Calif.) a “wacko.”\n\nTrump’s Phoenix stop marks the first of three campaign rallies he will headline over the next three days as part of a broader trip west that includes both official and political business.

            "content": "E-commerce business is the new and improved way to buy items from all over the world. Running an online store is one of the smartest and most profitable decisions that an entrepreneur can make. However, no one should enter into the global market without learning about its top traders along with the risks and benefits to your online business.\n\nChina\n\nChina is one of the biggest importers and exporters in the world. With a population of nearly two billion, their imports and exports exceed trillions of dollars. Much of their international business takes place in Hong Kong. China e-commerce businesses are major contributors to the world’s economic growth. Many people are buying products that are shipped directly from China or from companies that buy from Chinese exporters. As a new world power, it’s very important to learn more about China’s economy and trade industries.\n\nMexico and Canada\n\nMexico has a trillion-dollar economy that is one of the largest in North, Central and South America. It has the 15th largest economy in the world, making it an ideal partner for international trade and e-commerce business.\n\nCanada has a good, stable economy and a highly developed global market. Its GDP ranks among the top 20 in the world, making it a wealthy country with many potential customers for your business.\n\nEurope\n\nEuropean countries have always been ideal places to promote global trade. Some countries like Germany and the UK are more powerful traders than others. Europe exports products to more than a hundred countries around the world. The Internet has made it easier for online businesses and customers to buy and sell products there.\n\nThe Middle East\n\nIndia, with a population over one billion, is the biggest global market in the Middle East. Many Indian consumers belong to wealthy, affluent classes who are demanding high-quality imports from China, the U.S. and other trading countries. In return, they are exporting rare, exotic items that can only be found in the Middle East.\n\nFactors to Consider When Trading With Any Country\n\nWhen evaluating any country’s position in the global market, there are several factors to consider. Think about the size of the country’s economy compared to other countries in the world. The best indicator is the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita that is based on nominal or purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP. PPP rates are commonly used to compare varying GDP rates in different countries.\n\nEvaluate the diversity within the country’s market. The U.S. provides the most diverse selection of products that can be bought and sold in small businesses, franchises or e-commerce stores. A country that manufactures or exports only a few items will not be easy to trade with.\n\nOnce you enter the global market, always review the constantly changing trends in international trade. All of these changes have effects on your own business regardless of its size and industry. Think of laws that ease restrictions on certain industries like food safety or manufacturing. Consider the rates of economic growth in certain countries like China or Germany. Stay up to date on the news, and learn how the global market affects your e-commerce business."

The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all gained.More than 2,100 people have died from the coronavirus in China, spreading to more than two dozen countries, and governments around the world are trying to prevent it from becoming a global pandemic.The most dramatic move overnight was a steep drop in the Japanese yen, which posted its sharpest fall against the dollar in half a year, even as safe-haven assets such as gold traded firmer.Selling was broad and sustained through the session.The yen fell nearly 1.4 per cent against the dollar and the kiwi and almost 2 per cent against the Norwegian krone - its sharpest daily drop against the krone in almost three years .\"It is rare to see USD/JPY and gold ripping at the same time, but the simple explanation is that the world is awash in a flood of money and there are not many attractive places to park that excess liquidity,\" said Brent Donnelly, Spot FX Trader at HSBC.The yen recouped some of those losses in morning trade, to rise 0.2 per cent to 111.17 per dollar.Elsewhere oil prices held overnight gains, while gold gave some of its rise back.US crude last sat 30 cents firmer at $53.60 per barrel and Brent settled at $59.12. Gold last traded at $1,609.33 per ounce."

            "content": "Andrew MacDougall is a Director at Trafalgar Strategy, and a former Head of Communications to Prime Minister Stephen Harper\n\nWhat do Justin Trudeau, Peter Garrett, and Ian Smith have in common? Other than being powerful white men in ‘settler’ states at a point in their lives, probably nothing.\n\nIndeed, one assumes—quite comfortably—Trudeau and Garrett, the Midnight Oil singer/environmental and Indigenous rights campaigner turned Aussie cabinet minister, wouldn’t want to be caught dead in the same hypothetical conversation as Smith, ex-leader of the Rhodesian Front, who didn’t exactly share the former pair’s commitment to social justice. But that doesn’t mean the three of them didn’t grapple with a similar question, even if they did land on different sides of the ‘who should control the nation’s bounty’ divide.\n\nThe mid-1960’s postcolonial Smith was definitive: the white minority should remain in charge of a newly-independent Rhodesia and all of its spoils, not a British-backed multiracial government. Garrett was equally crystalline as he sang about the plight of Australia’s Aborigines in Midnight Oil’s 1987 mega-hit “Beds are Burning”: “The time has come, a fact’s a fact, it belongs to them, let’s give it back.” With the ‘it’ in question being Australia. And where does Trudeau come down?\n\nWell, if you take Trudeau at his word: on all sides. Trudeau is not only for Indigenous reconciliation, he is for natural resource development, for the environment, and stands four-square behind the rule of law. The trouble for Trudeau at the moment is the four corners of his agenda aren’t lining up into a square. Indeed, everything is askew. The protests over the Coastal GasLink pipeline have metastasized across Canada, drawing in groups and communities at great distance from ground zero in Northern British Columbia. Coastal GasLink is now a proxy for whatever the ultras want it to be.\n\nAnd while many a reasonable Liberal and Conservative will agree that responsible resource development can be squared with Canada’s climate commitments and recently-expanded Indigenous consultation regime, it’s not clear the Prime Minister has carried the argument with all of the impacted parties.\n\nAs the lawlessness spreads, it doesn’t appear to matter that regulators and 20 First Nation band councils along the Coastal GasLink route have said ‘yea’ to development, as long as a handful of Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs say ‘nay’. Is this pipeline dispute about the environment? Economic development? Or Indigenous governance? Or the right for Extinction Rebellion types to execute people’s arrest warrants against the democratically-elected NDP Premier of British Columbia? No one is quite sure anymore.\n\nAnd that includes Trudeau.\n\nPart of the reason everything has become a mess is because the Prime Minister has—to date—been happy to have his stakeholders believe their view is the one he really holds. But the simple truth is many of his stakeholders don’t believe you can square Trudeau’s circular pitch on energy, Indigenous rights and the economy. For them you can have one, and only at the expense of the others. And instead of using the current impasse to clarify or defend his position so that everyone can get on with their lives, Trudeau has (again) retreated to the comfort of the seminar room and its wet language, inviting more disruption and delay.\n\nLet’s take it as read that no-one wants an armed response. Fine. But the trouble with hosting an endless series of meetings that don’t produce a drop of action is that it emboldens the protesters and infuriates those Canadians who know they would go to the pokey for doing the same. Punting doesn’t take the issue of the boil, it turns the hob knob up to 11.\n\nYou want an off ramp? Start by separating the issues out instead of lumping them together. Draw clear lines. Enforce the law while setting up whatever safe space you need to have the dialogue most Canadians thought was already hard-wired into the law. Most importantly, explain to the protesters that civil disobedience has historically resulted in consequences. Indeed, that’s the bloody point of civil disobedience: get locked up to demonstrate the horribleness of the system. Divorced of consequence civil disobedience is anarchy, tarted-up.\n\nGoing the clarity route would risk making Trudeau some enemies. The Prime Minister already has enemies, of course. And he appears to be fine with the concept of being un-liked, as long as his critics are conservative. What he appears hesitant to bring on is opprobrium from any members of his progressive coalition. And as Jody Wilson-Raybould will also tell you, this Prime Minister doesn’t like to be challenged when he thinks he’s right. Or go ahead and ask Andrew Scheer, for that matter, who wasn’t invited to a meeting on the crisis because he said something the Prime Minister disagreed with in the House which, as near as I can tell, was simply repeating what millions of Canadians are currently saying around their water coolers and dinner tables.\n\nWhich brings us back to Zimbabwe and Midnight Oil.\n\nIan Smith was never going to win the argument as a representative of the white minority elite. Robert Mugabe was on the right side of history, even if he then went on to write some of the most disastrous and shameful chapters in recent political history as the dictator of Zimbabwe. And while Peter Garrett went on to complete the rare move from activist to legislator, the plight of the Australian Aborigine remains much the same as it was when he was hectoring for change from the stage. Not much has been “given back”. And forget the beds, large swathes of Australia are now burning.\n\nTrudeau’s trouble is that he knows—much like Garrett—he can’t deliver for Canada’s Indigenous people, at least not in a way the most militant activists want or in a manner that will fully right a historical wrong. Trudeau has already had five years in power and hasn’t succeeded in moving the dial, as the current pipeline impasse so clearly demonstrates. Here, Trudeau’s failure is arguably worse than any by Stephen Harper, if only because the latter didn’t promise a moon he couldn’t deliver. Hopes are being dashed.\n\nCanada might be the most progressive country in the world, true to Trudeau’s dreams, but will the majority of Canadians ever be prepared to upend a system that works incredibly well for the vast majority of people but very poorly for some of the country’s oldest and most impoverished populations?\n\nTrudeau’s choice is now whether he sides with the Indigenous leadership that have chosen to pursue economic opportunity through Canada’s current, if flawed, system, or whether he puts that chance at prosperity on hold in favour of a broader and much more difficult conversation that risks putting a much larger population out of joint.\n\nMORE ABOUT COASTAL GASLINK PIPELINE:"

            "content": "The British government has unveiled plans to revamp the UK’s post-Brexit immigration system. Work visas for low skilled migrants will now be curtailed and a new focus will be put on investing in training programmes for British citizens.\n\nThe desire to control immigration was, of course, one of the key reasons why the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. With many claiming that the bloc’s freedom of movement policy contributed to wage stagnation, increased property prices and overpopulation in large cities.\n\nJournalist Marcus Stead gave his views on whether the new plans put forward by the Conservative Party will finally placate the British public’s worries.\n\nSputnik: How will the British government’s new immigration policy affect the country’s economy?\n\nMarcus Stead: The government is today outlining what its immigration policy is going to be, once the transition period comes to an end, and it’s clear that there is going to be a points-based system, with an emphasis on the skills of the individual, skills shortages in the UK, and a minimum salary threshold for the position you’ve been offered, so that you are likely to be a contributor to, rather than a beneficiary of the benefits system.\n\nAs Home Secretary Priti Patel says, this will now be a level playing field, so somebody from Australia will not be at an advantage over somebody from France, or vice-versa more to the point perhaps. The big problem is, who is going to pick the fruits in the fields of Lincolnshire in the summer? Who is going to wipe the tables of the coffee shops of London? Who is going to clean the toilets of the hospitals up and down the country?\n\nIt’s true to say that an oversupply of cheap labour in the UK has led to a suppression of wages in low skilled jobs, but even so, there is a cultural problem in the UK in that a lot of young people in particular seem to think that they are above doing these sorts of jobs. And the reality is for the most part, employers have also spoken very highly of labour from places like Poland, they have a good work ethic, they can be trusted to turn up on time and do an honest day’s work.\n\nHow do we replace them? These types of workers wouldn’t do very well under the proposed new points system, and I suggest that it would come hand in hand with benefit reform. Despite the rather clumsy and sometimes downright cruel attempts at benefit reform with the rollout of universal credit in recent years, the UK welfare bill went up from 253 billion pounds in 2013 to 264 billion pounds in 2017.\n\nWhatever you may think of Iain Duncan-Smith’s reforms, it was really tinkering around the edges, and this rocketing bill is not sustainable in the long term. So the government needs to think big when it comes to tackling welfare dependency, and bluntly, that means that welfare should only really be for pensioners, the genuinely disabled, and temporary help for the unemployed as they find alternative work. Pretty much everything else will be unaffordable long term, as the reality is that we are living longer, pensions are costing more year on year, and a very large number of people rely on the state because of social breakdown, and a decline of the traditional family unit.\n\nThere’s a carrot and stick element to this. The stick is that low skilled unemployed people need to be told that they are not above picking the fruit or wiping the tables, and the carrot is that ending uncontrolled mass immigration will put an end to the suppression of wages caused by an oversupply of cheap labour, and therefore wages should rise in the long term.\n\nThat cultural shift will not prove to be an easy one. We need to return to the work ethic of previous generations, our grandparents' generations, where welfare dependency was frowned upon.\n\nSputnik: Will the UK be able to negotiate a post-Brexit free trade deal with the EU?\n\nMarcus Stead: We need to get real about what’s happened here, and about what’s on offer. Last Thursday the UK’s Chief EU negotiator David Frost made a speech in Brussels, where he called for a Canada style free-trade agreement type relationship.\n\nUnder that Canada agreement, import tariffs on most goods have been eliminated, though there will still be customs and VAT checks, but that is the least of the negotiating team’s problems right now.\n\nBear in mind that Boris Johnson’s own deadline for the negotiations is the 31st of December this year. He says that if no deal is reached by then, the UK will trade with the EU on WTO terms.\n\nSo with that in mind, here is what happened with Canada. It’s formally known as CETA, which stands for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The framework for talks was agreed in March 2004. A study assessing the costs and benefits was released in October 2008. Negotiations were officially announced on the sixth of May 2009. An agreement in principal was signed four years later on the 18th of October 2013, and negotiations were concluded on the first of August 2014, with the EU Parliament approving the agreement on the 15th of February 2017, and after that, it required ratification from a total of 38 legislative bodies across the EU.\n\nWe’re still a very long way from all of that being done, and the vast majority of these legislative bodies have not yet passed the agreement. Just yesterday, the Dutch lower house just about gave its consent in a very tight vote. There’s no guarantee that the upper house will still do so, that remains to be seen. And the French lower house ratified it on the 23rd of July last year, whilst the upper house has not yet done so.\n\nWith all that in mind, the process that began in 2004 and has not ended yet, does David Frost and the rest of Boris Johnson’s negotiating team really think we can get a Canada style free trade agreement ratified by December this year?\n\nUnless the EU changes its own procedures, it’s a complete non-starter. Does Mr Frost think that it’s a case of picking the Canada style agreement off the shelf and tipexing the word Canada out, and replacing it with the words UK? In the real world, it’s not going to be anything like as simple as that.\n\nMeanwhile the EU’s Chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has made it clear that the UK cannot have the same deal as Canada because of its geographic and economic proximity to the EU, as the reality is that the UK and the EU would become economic competitors as well as partners.\n\nThe EU has also said that it wants a common set of rules on worker’s rights, environmental regulations, and state aid, including subsidies for business, and the EU has also said that it will refuse to give British companies tariff-free access to the single market if British companies have the ability to undercut rivals based in the EU.\n\nDavid Frost said in his speech last week that the freedom to diverge was the whole point of Brexit, and he insists that the UK will have high standards, but they won’t be the EU’s standards, and for the EU that does not appear to be good enough.\n\nThat is the argument that will be one of the main battles in the months ahead.\n\nSputnik: Could Boris Johnson cave in and accept EU regulations for the sake of avoiding a reversion to WTO rules?\n\nMarcus Stead: Mr Frost also said that the UK needs to have the ability to set laws that suit us, and the European Court of Justice must not have any jurisdiction in the UK, and that the UK will set out more details next week on the stance, and how he feels the relationship should be.\n\nOne of Boris Johnson’s main character flaws is that he is not a man known for his attention to detail, or for policy depth. The jury is still out as to whether Mr Frost and his team have the necessary skillset to make up for that, in what will be very tough negotiations with the EU in the months ahead, and the clock is ticking.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."

(Cebelihle Mthethwa/News24)\n\nMore than 20 civil society groups have submitted their recommendations to the Zondo commission on how to reform the state and private sector in the wake of state capture.\n\n\n\n'An Agenda for Action' was submitted to the commission this month by organisations including Open Secrets, the Dullah Omar Institute, Equal Education and Corruption Watch.\n\nThe coalition was based on their unity against the looting of public funds and a commitment to promoting the interests of the public.\n\nAt a briefing on Wednesday, Open Secrets researcher Mike Marchant said their submission sought to \"put on the agenda the fact that banks, law firms, consultancies and accountants sit at the heart of the economy which enables corruption\".\n\nOPINION | Dear Shamila Batohi, the honeymoon is over\n\nIt was not necessarily a solution to turn away from the State and towards the private sector for solutions to state capture, he said.\n\nTogether with Shadow World Investigations, their investigative report 'The Enablers' hoped to draw the commission's attention to the role of the private sector in facilitating alleged criminal conduct.\n\nOrganised crime network\n\nMarchant raised the recent scandal surrounding global consultancy firm McKinsey, who subcontracted Gupta-linked firm Trillian, allegedly without a contract in place, to assist with developing a turnaround plan for Eskom. McKinsey settled with Eskom in July 2018, agreeing to pay back nearly R1bn and admitting it overcharged the parastatal, Fin24 reported.\n\nREAD | Nail them on tax and the rest will follow, says Motlanthe\n\nWith any organised crime network, the main challenge was obscuring the fact that money was illicitly obtained and then getting that money out, he said.\n\nWith the Estina/Vrede dairy project, Marchant questioned why banks facilitated transactions instead of flagging and stopping it.\n\n\"For example, why would a local dairy company be sending money to Dubai?\n\n\"And yet those banks banked that company for years, Standard Bank for many years prior to 2015. Remarkably FNB [First National Bank] continued to bank Estina even after the Free State department had cancelled the contract.\"\n\n'Pay back the money'\n\nHe said some of their recommendations were aimed at the role of the Zondo commission, such as changing the narrative.\n\n\"The TRC didn't look at the private sector during apartheid and the entrenched system of corruption. [Zondo] has the opportunity to place private actors from the margins to central analysis.\"\n\nALSO READ | Zondo says not granting commission extension will be a disaster\n\nStandard Bank's former group legal counsel Ian Sinton, who has testified more than once at the commission, first told Zondo that the bank was allegedly pressured to rescind a decision to close its business with the Guptas' Oakbay company in September 2018, News24 reported.\n\nFNB also testified on the same incident, with former First Rand CEO Johan Burger saying it played hardball and declined to attend a meeting called by an inter-ministerial committee to discuss the closure of the Guptas' accounts, News24 reported. It was the first time in his 32 years in banking he had heard of such a request.\n\nIn another appearance in March 2019, Sinton attempted to show how multi-million rand transactions were made between certain Gupta-linked company accounts, having first been transferred from state-owned enterprises like Transnet and Eskom, News24 reported.\n\nMarchant said the commission should use its powers to interrogate banking executives on what steps they took to stop very conspicuous and corrupt transactions.\n\nThere should also be a change in how to \"pay back the money\", perhaps by creating a fund to benefit the true victims of state capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Corporations which have been caught out quickly pay back the fees from the project, say sorry and move on,\" said Marchant.\n\nHe said these fees did not account for the damage wrought on vulnerable institutions.\n\nImplicated firms should not pick and choose where the money went to try and \"whitewash their reputations\".\n\nOpen Secrets director Hennie van Vuuren said they believed the joint submission by the civil society groups could achieve the change that was needed."

New robotic environmental management will also be tested alongside live monitoring of the health of Sherwood Forest to preserve the site for future generations.\n\nFunding will also go to 5G trials in air and sea search and rescue in Dorset to help save lives using terrestrial and satellite connectivity. This project will also trial 5G connectivity for remote farms to track crop growth, monitor livestock and reduce water pollution using 5G.\n\nThese new trials will help spread the benefits of technology across the country and allow the UK to grasp an early advantage by using the new applications 5G networks can enable.\n\nThis forms part of our £200 million investment in testbeds and trials across the UK to explore new ways that 5G can boost business growth and productivity, improve the lives of people in rural areas and maximise the productivity benefits of new technologies. Our innovative trials will also support the Government’s ambition to diversify the supply chain for digital infrastructure in the UK, a key recommendation from the Supply Chain Review.\n\nDigital Secretary Oliver Dowden said:\n\nWe’re determined to make the UK a world-leader in 5G and deliver on our promise to improve connections for people and businesses across the country. Today we’re announcing new funding to seize the new opportunities this technology will offer us. This includes seeing how it could create new jobs in the countryside, make businesses more productive and unleash even more ideas in our cutting-edge creative industries.\n\nCouncillor Kay Cutts, leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, said:\n\nThis project will be front and centre of retelling the story of Robin Hood to future generations. It will be situated in the ancient royal forest of Sherwood, which has been wooded since the end of the last Glacial Period. There is no better opportunity to trial 5G in a forest setting anywhere else in the UK – not just for the area’s geography, but for its rich and fascinating history. I see this project as the start of a journey that will truly see Nottinghamshire on the regional, national and international tourism and environment management maps; as well as providing us with the opportunity to build the digital skills and opportunities of our residents and businesses.\n\nResearch lead professor Mohammad Patwary, from Birmingham City University, said:\n\nThis is a unique opportunity for the UK to become a world-leader exploiting the technological innovation that 5G can offer by developing and using innovative technology for destination branding for the visitor economy, preserving the wellbeing of the environment, and creating a scalable and sustainable commercial grade experimental network; a world first.\n\n5G has speeds up to ten times faster than 4G and will greatly increase mobile capacity across the UK, meaning more people will be able to get online and find and download the content they want, without slowdown.\n\nBut 5G is about more than a speedier internet connection. It uses technology that is far more advanced than that of our current mobile networks, so as time goes on it could transform the way we interact with critical services - from energy and water, to transport and healthcare.\n\nIt will also drive the adoption of new technologies such as driverless cars, remote healthcare and the ‘smart’ devices we increasingly use in our homes and at work.\n\nThe £65 million package announced today includes:\n\n£30 million for the Rural Connected Communities (RCC) competition for seven 5G research and development projects across the UK. This includes five in England, one in Wales and one in Scotland with plans to expand into Northern Ireland. Test sites will be set up in Yorkshire, Gwent, Monmouthshire, Orkney, Wiltshire, Nottinghamshire, Dorset, Shropshire and Worcestershire.\n\nMore than £5 million of funding will be awarded to two industrial projects, led by Ford Motor Company and Zeetta Networks, to test the benefits of using 5G to boost productivity in the manufacturing sector.\n\nA new £30 million open competition - 5G Create - has been launched to develop new uses for 5G in a variety of industries, including our creative sectors such as film, TV and video games. From enabling remote production to supporting the expansion of the increasingly popular world of esports, 5G has the potential to revolutionise the UK’s booming creative industries.\n\nTim Davie, Co-Chair of the Creative Industries Council and CEO of BBC Studios, said:\n\nThe Creative Industries Council is delighted that DCMS is launching 5G Create. We have been advocating a funded competition along these lines, as an exciting opportunity for UK creative companies to develop innovative products and services using this transformational technology. 5G offers innovative opportunities right across the sector from film and tv, to games, to music, fashion and advertising. We hope that start-ups and well-established companies alike will bid for the available funds.\n\nThe new 5G Create competition will open in early March and run until the end of June.\n\nENDS\n\nMore information on the projects\n\nWhile the commercial rollout of 5G by mobile companies continues at pace, the government is investing in these testbeds to push the envelope of what high speed connectivity can do across a range of industries and geographic areas.\n\nInternational firms, SMEs, public sector organisations and universities will come together to prove new ways for 5G to transform rural tourism and farming, tackle loneliness and improve digital skills in some of the UK’s remote areas from the Orkney Islands to the Chalke Valley. In North Yorkshire, 5G will be used to monitor the environment to give the county council and its partners an early warning system for flooding.\n\nIn the industrial projects, UK tech company Zeetta will lead 5G-ENCODE based at Bristol’s National Composites Centre. It will experiment with how 5G can improve the design and manufacture of composite materials, including through augmented reality and the remote monitoring of multiple factories at once. Vodafone Business and Ford will lead a consortium trialling how 5G mobile private networks can improve the manufacture of electric vehicles at two sites in Essex and Cambridge.\n\n5G Create is an open competition with the Government hoping to attract bids from a variety of industries where the UK has a competitive advantage, encouraging dynamic business models and opening up new opportunities and markets. This includes our creative industries but also our rich variety of technology businesses in sectors such as energy, water, health and social care and logistics.\n\nNone of the winning projects, or future projects from 5G Create, will use equipment from high risk vendors.\n\nRural Connected Communities Projects\n\nMobile Access North Yorkshire (MANY)\n\nGovernment funding: £4,431,677\n\nProject Summary\n\nThe Mobile Access North Yorkshire (MANY) project will support the development of future rural connectivity in the county by developing new technologies, apps and services tailored for rural areas. These will focus on tourism, mental health, coverage for emergency services and environmental management.\n\nThe project will build small mobile phone networks in areas that have no mobile coverage. It aims to understand how the public, private and community sectors can work together to reduce the cost of delivering mobile access in rural areas. The project is led by Quickline Communications, the largest wireless ISP in the country working with North Yorkshire County Council, two universities and four small businesses.\n\nSteve Jagger, Managing Director, Quickline said:\n\nQuickline’s mission is to use innovation in equipment and approach to bring ubiquitous coverage of high speed data and associated services across the harder to reach parts of the country. We are pleased to be part of a project that shares these values and outcomes and are excited by the opportunity to push the boundaries further.\n\nWest Mercia Rural 5G\n\nGovernment funding: £3,285,705\n\nProject Summary\n\nOperating in the rural area where the counties of Shropshire and Worcestershire meet, ‘West Mercia Rural 5G’ will explore infrastructure challenges when planning, building and operating a rural 5G network and look at how 5G can enhance services for the benefit of residents, particularly researching 5G enabled health and social care applications.\n\nLed by Worcestershire County Council, key partners on the network side are Airband and Three who will plan, build and operate the 5G network. Local NHS organisations alongside Worcestershire County Council and Shropshire Council will work on the health and social care applications. The University of Worcester, University Centre Shrewsbury, and West Midlands Academic Health Science Network are providing their expert support across the project.\n\nCouncillor Ken Pollock, Worcestershire County Council’s cabinet member with responsibility for economy and infrastructure, said:\n\nWorcestershire County Council are delighted to have been successful in leading a bid which will investigate the positive impacts that emerging 5G technologies could have on rural communities, around how 5G networks can be built and their use in supporting health and social care services. The project highlights the huge joint ambitions of the innovative public and private sector partners we have drawn together, as we strive to find ways to improve connectivity and provide access to key services in rural areas.\n\nAt a time of increasing demand for public services, improvements in connected technologies offer new ways of working that can help maintain and improve service delivery and quality of life for residents and businesses alike.\n\n5G Connected Forest\n\nGovernment funding: £4,975,948\n\nProject Summary\n\nCentred around the ancient Sherwood Forest, the focus of the 5G Connected Forest project will be to explore the potential for 5G applications in the preservation of forests and their environment, and in enhancing the experience of visitors to the forest and surrounding area.\n\nFrom robotic environmental management and non-intrusive live monitoring of the health of a forest, to live AR and VR experiences for visitors of all ages, and inspiring public transport users; the project will also investigate business models that can enable operators to boost rural connectivity and create innovative applications with the potential for commercial development.\n\nCouncillor Kay Cutts, Leader of Nottinghamshire County Council said:\n\nThis project will be front and centre of retelling the story of Robin Hood to future generations. It will be situated in the ancient royal forest of Sherwood, which has been wooded since the end of the last Glacial Period. There is no better opportunity to trial 5G in a forest setting anywhere else in the UK – not just for the area’s geography, but for its rich and fascinating history. I see this project as the start of a journey that will truly see Nottinghamshire on the regional, national and international tourism and environment management maps; as well as providing us with the opportunity to build the digital skills and opportunities of our residents and businesses.\n\nResearch Lead Professor Mohammad Patwary, Birmingham City University said:\n\nThis is a unique opportunity for the UK to become a world-leader exploiting the technological innovation that 5G can offer by developing and using innovative technology for destination branding for the visitor economy, preserving the wellbeing of the environment, and creating a scalable and sustainable commercial grade experimental network; a world first.\n\nMONeH (Multi Operator Neutral Host)\n\nGovernment funding: £2,359,762\n\nProject Summary\n\nThe MONeH Consortium, led by Telet Research, CH4LKE Mobile and Associated Networks, aims to demonstrate how multi-operator, neutral host cellular networks based upon small cell technology can be used to provide multiple user slices, serving different customer groups within rural areas with little or no coverage. Initial deployment will be in the Chalke Valley, South West Wiltshire with two other sites in Preston Bissett, Buckinghamshire and Lucknam Park, near Bath.\n\nDeployments will utilise unused mobile spectrum, using the new Ofcom-issued Local Access licencing procedures to offer a service that is both technically and financially robust in areas where conventional coverage solutions are not commercially viable for mobile network operators or cannot scale to cover small areas.\n\nJames Body, Technical Architect of the MONeH Consortium, said:\n\nInstead of building large, expensive and unpopular large masts in our rural areas, we can use inexpensive low power small cells to provide a quality local service to users of all mobile networks, in addition to Emergency Services, National Health Service, Utility companies and any other local private users in a rapidly deployable and cost effective manner. Empowering local organizations to deploy their own networks offers reduced costs, shorter build times and the ability to provide coverage where it is really needed.\n\n5G RuralDorset\n\nGovernment funding: £4,335,000\n\nProject Summary\n\nCoastal public services – using 5G to save lives and enhance safety in coastal areas focusing on incident prevention. Using terrestrial and satellite connectivity, we aim to track critical equipment and pilot advanced search and rescue techniques.\n\nAgri-tech - how connectivity needed by remote farms can be delivered cost-effectively. We will pilot leading-edge agricultural technologies to track crop growth, monitor livestock and reduce water pollution.\n\nCommercial connectivity - new 5G services on the Lulworth Estate and festival site, unlocking potential social and commercial uses from tourism and education to safety.\n\n5G innovation hub - developing Dorset Innovation Park (formerly Winfrith) to allow existing and new businesses to test and develop 5G products and services collaboratively and securely.\n\nDeputy Leader of Dorset Council Peter Wharf said:\n\nWe are delighted to receive this funding. Improved connectivity is critical to our smart rural place aspirations and making Dorset a great place to live, work and visit. Introduced sensitively in our world-famous UNESCO-recognised coastline and the wider environment, 5G can help keep vulnerable people safe and well, deliver economic growth, and provide enhanced educational and social opportunities. The 5G RuralDorset project is an exciting opportunity for our county to become a leader in Europe, showing how next generation connectivity can positively transform lives in rural communities. We look forward to sharing our learning experiences with other parts of the UK.\n\n5G New Thinking\n\nGovernment funding: £5,000,000\n\nProject Summary\n\nThe 5G New Thinking project will look at the provision of mobile/wireless connectivity primarily using the shared spectrum and local spectrum licencing options announced by Ofcom in July 2019. Working closely with communities, the project will develop a community toolkit to allow the creation of networks that provide rural connectivity for cooperatives of consumers, local enterprise, councils and other stakeholders. The project will work to create facilities and tools for spectrum sharing and monitoring, neutral hosting, partnerships and B2B engagement models with operators. In its first stage the project will create models, strategies and use case demonstrators on the Orkney Islands network, and engage forward with community and council partners in Borderlands, Scotland, Northern Ireland and areas of rural England to help develop and ultimately roll-out 5G connectivity.\n\nDez O’ Connor, Cisco and Chief Technologist of 5G New Thinking Project, said:\n\nWe’re excited to be working on this new and ambitious rural connected community project with DCMS. The new project, 5G New Thinking, aims to showcase the benefits of 5G rural connectivity and sustainability. Cisco and its partners are bringing forward extensive knowledge from recent projects, including 5G RuralFirst based in Orkney, Somerset and Shropshire. We’re pleased to be working again with principal partner, University of Strathclyde, and others including BBC R&D, CloudNet IT Solutions, and also new partners such as Federated Wireless, Pure Leapfrog and the Scotland 5G Centre. With key ingredients of spectrum, cloud and core, backhaul, and community/civic engagement the project will look at how it can help to address some of the most pressing technology challenges to help the UK in improving connectivity across rural, and indeed so called ultra-rural areas.\n\nConnected Communities in the Rural Economy (CoCoRE)\n\nGovernment funding: £5,000,000\n\nProject summary\n\nThe project will connect rural communities by demonstrating how 5G technology can open up new opportunities for businesses and citizens. It’s focus is centred upon the south east Wales rural region of Monmouthshire and its neighbour Blaenau Gwent. We will innovate in areas such as ‘immersive tourism’ and ‘farming security’ as key parts of the rural economy, whilst leveraging related technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things and Cyber Security as part of an ‘innovation platform’. Everyone in every industry will feel the positive effects of 5G and we aim to put rural Wales at the front of the queue through our ‘Connected Communities in the Rural Economy’ project.\n\nSecretary of State for Wales Simon Hart said:\n\nThe UK Government is committed to eliminating the difference in connection between urban and rural areas whilst exploring innovative ways to use 5G technology to develop emerging industries, supporting our rural economy in Wales. Today’s announcement is a great opportunity for rural parts of Wales to boost the productivity and capacity of their digital infrastructure and forms a key part of our plans to build a UK which is fit for the future.\n\nIndustrial 5G Projects\n\n5GEM - 5G Enabled Manufacture\n\nGovernment funding: £1,942,275\n\nProject Summary\n\nThis project will focus on the use of 5G in manufacturing to connect machines allowing real-time feedback, control, analysis and remote expert support. Two Vodafone mobile private networks will be installed in Ford Motor Company’s Dunton facility and TWI Cambridge, respectively. Ford will focus on the connectivity of welding processes, used in the manufacture of electric vehicles. TWI will support Vacuum Furnace Engineering in connecting their heat treatment equipment. ATS, TM Forum, HSSMI and Lancaster University join the consortium to work on the associated challenges such as cyber security, scale-up, standards, machine learning and developing the 5G technology for an industrial environment.\n\nChris White, Ford 5GEM Project Lead, said:\n\nConnecting today’s shopfloor requires significant time and investment. The technology used is inflexible and bespoke. It can often be viewed as the limiting factor in reconfiguring and deploying reliable manufacturing systems. 5G presents the opportunity to transform the speed of launch and flexibility of present manufacturing facilities, moving us towards tomorrow’s factories with mobile assets, remote computing, remote expert support and artificial intelligence. Through 5GEM, we will build two demonstrators to accelerate this transformation within the UK and beyond. These test beds will be an excellent environment for our partners to resolve the issues around making this technology shop floor ready and supporting the fourth industrial revolution.\n\n5G ENCODE\n\nGovernment funding: £3,822,760\n\nProject Summary\n\nZeetta, a UK technology company, has been selected to lead the £9m DCMS-funded 5G-ENCODE project at the National Composites Centre (NCC) in Bristol.\n\nThe consortium comprises ten companies including Telefonica, Siemens, Toshiba, Solvay and Baker Hughes. Zeetta will be offering its multi-domain orchestration technology based on 5G network splicing and slicing.\n\nThe project will examine new business models for private mobile networks in the manufacturing sector. It will investigate three key industrial 5G use cases to improve productivity and effectiveness of composite design and manufacture: interactive augmented reality (AR); asset tracking across multiple sites and locations; and industrial system management.\n\nThe 5G-ENCODE project will start in February 2020 and will run until March 2022.\n\nVassilis Seferidis, CEO of Zeetta Networks, said:\n\nZeetta is proud to be leading the 5G-ENCODE project on behalf of a consortium of leading industrial innovators. The company has a strong track record of delivering 5G solutions based on our network splicing™ and slicing technology which is a key enabler in delivering multi-domain orchestration across public and private networks for a seamless and customised delivery of 5G services. The ability to dynamically slice and dice the resources of the network according to the demands of users and applications is the fundamental difference between 5G and older technologies and it is expected to play a transformational role in improving industrial productivity.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nDCMS press office can be contacted on 020 7211 2210."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there’ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Adrian Littlewood. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nWell, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I'm joined by Phil Neutze, our CFO. It's a pleasure to present our first half results for 2020. So, I'll refer to the presentation. The presentation is a fully complete document. We’ll touch on the highlights of the year as required.\n\nSo look, turning to Page 4 and just a quick scan of the results. Overall, look at an interesting year for tourism and one that just gets more interesting in the next few months. But looking back at the prior half from our results point of view, look at reasonably flat results, up 1% on revenue, underlying profit up just a touch over 2% to $140 million and strong growth investment in capital assets up about 75% on prior period, reflecting the big program we have underway.\n\nUnderneath all that, obviously, tourism markets cycling through a more subdued period. We've had some changes and additions, I guess, in our market. The passenger movements in the period just softly down just 0.5%. Underlying earnings per share $0.115 and dividends about $0.11 in the period.\n\nSo looking at Page 5, just looking at the different lines of business inside our organization. As I touch on before, aeronautical, obviously, influenced by the moderating passenger growth and across both international and domestic. Domestic affected obviously by the exit of Jetstar on regional, but also some capacity being held back from the market.\n\nIn fact, overall, and I'll talk about the slider strengthening lives right across our international and domestic market suggests this, there's no demand problem there. Retail performed well in that context up 2.5% in the period, a good lift in international passenger spin rates just a touch under 5% and a continuing good lift in Off airport sales.\n\nTransport, a bit of jumps around there with a big increase in capacity, obviously, flowing through to our revenue per space, softer in the period, but overall revenue up 4.5% in the period. Properties continued its good run. We got about $300 million of direct investments underway and running, revenue for the period up 6%, very strong occupancy still being held and then we obviously have our JV investments of the hotel on top of that.\n\nAnd, in fact, our hotels, some of the best performing hotels in the country. So. revenue in the up 5.5%, but we continue to see strength in that market supporting our future investment. And lastly, Queenstown had another really good period there, great passenger growth and it flying through to a 15% lift in revenue.\n\nSo, turning to Page 6, and this is a little bit looking ahead and Phil will touch on guidance in a minute, but naturally, like everyone, we are very focused on the coronavirus impact and how that is unfolding. Obviously, not really showing up in our first-half results, but something we’re looking ahead to. And frankly, it is evolving. We are tracking the information like everyone else to try and understand how it is unfolding. There is going to be an impact on our business and we are sort of assessing what that looks like.\n\nWe have obviously looked back to past events like size and others in the past. I think there's no question that this is different to that. And it just reflects the influence and impact of the Chinese economy globally, as well as on our country and our travel markets. So, this has got some time to work through, but we have tried to judge, we'll talk about that shortly the impact on to here.\n\nI mean, longer-term, we still have that overall confidence in our longer-term prospects and our markets have traditionally remained very resilient to that. And what will be interesting to see is, as this issue works its way through how the various markets respond and we're certainly starting to see this without government putting more stimulus into the international tourism marketing with a new fund.\n\nCertainly, other markets like Singapore government tipping in a huge amount of money into the tourism market simulation, and obviously waiting to see what the Chinese government does in response to try and get the economy going again. So, we're monitoring this really, really closely and we have seen an impact on obviously travel demand in China and we'll need to work our way through that later.\n\nThe other big thing for this period is that, the very big investment program that’s underway. Lots of projects in the ground now and going that's really pleasing to see that it's done to get the diggers into the ground. There's some highlights there about expansion and renewal around our airfield, stands, taxi wise and renew works, got our northern road network, which travelers to Auckland can see every day as they come through.\n\nWe’ve announced today, we'll touch on this later, the new international arrivals project, as well as the formation of a construction alliance for the build of the new Domestic Jet Hub and our commercial property business continues to go fast with our hotel building and others. So, a really historic period, I think of investment in growth in critical assets for the future.\n\nWell, before I go into more detail, I'm going to hand to Phil just to update on outlook and guidance and then tune in detail to our financial results. So, Phil, over to you?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nThanks. Thanks, Adrian, and for the eagle-eyed out there. You might notice that this is the first time I’ve ever started with guidance. So, it's a little bit different this year. Naturally, listeners will be particularly interested in how we’re expecting things to shape up for the full financial year, given the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nSo, let's start with our guidance then I'll get on to the interim results. So this updated guidance is based on our knowledge and expectations as of today. We will update, if necessary, if actual outcomes differ materially from our current assumptions.\n\nSo, turning now to Slide 8. First one even of size that Covid-19 impact on underlying profit is uncertain. Our current forecast is approximately $10 million after-tax impact and the second-half of FY 2020 and that’s over both aeronautical [indiscernible] revenues and that assumes increasing impacts over March and April, and then a gradual recovery over May and June.\n\nPrior to the coronavirus outbreak, our guidance would have been unchanged for the full-year, but we now expect FY 2020 underlying profit to be between $260 million and $270 million for the full-year. I think it's also important to reconfirm to our investors that our dividend policy has unchanged and this has informed our $0.11 per share dividend for the first-half.\n\nLooking at our high-level Covid-19 assumptions, we see the greatest impact being on passengers direct to and from China from February 2020; and as I mentioned a gradual recovery over May and June. We say a lot albeit still significant reduction in pigs from other countries that were previously transiting through China. And we expect other Asian direct routes to be down to, about to a lesser extent and what we some flown to New Zealand domestic travel.\n\nSo looking at CapEx guidance, we continue to expect total CapEx in FY 2020 of between $450 million and $550 million for the year and we see total commission CapEx for PSE3 to be on track versus our original forecast.\n\nSo, let's now turn to the financial results for first-half, we’re now on Page 10. Starting with the aeronautical revenue, we had reductions this half, reflecting resetting our target return for PSE3 to 6.62% from the start of FY 2020 onwards and [that lowered] overall revenue growth to 1.1% for the half year.\n\nGiven the slowing revenue growth that we've been expecting this year, we've been working hard on OpEx discipline and first-half OpEx growth for FY 2020 fell to 2.1% that versus 13.6% in the prior corresponding period and 6.3% for the full 2019 financial year. Underlying profit after-tax was up a bit stronger than EBITDAFI at 2.2% versus PCP and that was assisted by lower interest expense.\n\nSo, looking at revenues now in more detail on Slide 11, it was a 5.4% reduction in aeronautical income – sorry, airfield income and that’s landing and aircraft parking charges. That was impacted in roughly equal proportions by [our aero] price reductions, as well as reduced make time.\n\nThe 2.4% reduction in passenger charges on the other hand was dominated by the aeronautical price reductions from the start of this year. And, however, these aeronautical revenue reductions were more than offset by solid total revenue growth versus PCP, and that was across retail, the car parking, and investment property.\n\nSo, retail income increased by 2.5%, parking revenue grew by 4.3%, and nearly 60% of the $2.6 million property rental increase was driven by rental reviews on existing properties and the remainder was from new properties added to the portfolio.\n\nTurning to Page 12 now, international passenger numbers, excluding transits were down very slightly on PCP, and that mainly reflected the exit of Air Asia X and Hong Kong Airlines services during FY 2019, partly offset by some growth elsewhere. Domestic passenger numbers fell more significantly than international this half and that reflected, as Adrian touched on, Jetstar’s regional exit in November 2019 and New Zealand's capacity reductions on domestic routes. Transits increased slightly for the period, as explained on this slide.\n\nLooking at the aircraft movements and MCTOW on Slide 13, both of these measures declined by more than the passenger numbers and that implied higher load factors in airline profitability on both domestic and international services versus PCP. And the greater fall in international MCTOW and aircraft movements and international reflected Air Asia X’s canceled Tasman services being backfilled by smaller aircraft for New Zealand, Virgin, and Qantas.\n\nOn to Slide 14, so asset management maintenance and airport operations continues to be our biggest cost growth category. Roughly a quarter of the $3.9 million growth versus PCP in this cost category reflected increased activity in revenue generating [indiscernible] businesses, for example, valet parking and parking lot and the reminder was driven by additional aeronautical operations and maintenance costs.\n\nRates and insurance costs increased by $1 million, reflecting valuation uplifts that was across our entire property portfolio, particularly the international terminal following the completion of the outbound processing, retail capacity enhancements, as well as investment property developments.\n\nAnd these increases were offset somewhat by a $2 million reduction in consultancy and legal costs versus PCP. So, overall, we had growth in OpEx significantly down on previous periods at 2.1% versus 13.6% PCP. And finally, interest expense fell 13.5%, reflecting lower average rates in higher capitalized interest.\n\nTurning now to Slide 15. As Queenstown Airport delivered another strong contribution to our underlying profit, up nearly 30% versus PCP, and that was on the strong international OpEx growth of 17.1%. And Novotel hotel joint venture with Tainui also delivered a strong underlying profit contribution for the half year. It was up 9.5% and we were very pleased to see a lift in both occupancy and average room rate versus the first half of FY 2019, given the growth in hotel room supply on the Auckland market over the last 12 months. In fact, we did much better than the overall Auckland market in this regard.\n\nSo, I'll be handing back to Adrian shortly to talk to Auckland airports progress against their four key strategic themes, but first, a quick look at CapEx and funding on Slides 16 and 17. So, the chart on Slide 16 shows that aeronautical investment property CapEx for the first-half of FY 2020 was almost identical to our full-year CapEx in those categories for FY 2019 and total CapEx was up 74% on PCP.\n\nWe remain comfortable that our full-year CapEx will fall within our reconfirmed guidance of between $450 million and $550 million. And we've refined our approach to risk adjusting our detailed bottom-up CapEx forecasts for deliverability. And this approach informs our longer-term CapEx projections.\n\nSo, aeronautical projects underway in [indiscernible] H1 FY 2020 are described on the slide. So that includes getting start of them new northern stands and taxiways, the international arrivals expansion and the design of the new Domestic Jet terminal. And as I mentioned before, we still expect commission [indiscernible] CapEx during PSE3 to be broadly on track with our original processing forecast.\n\nSo, finally from me, turning to Slide 17. This slide summarizes our borrowing portfolio as at 31st of December 2019 and summarizes our key credit metrics, all of which is strong. The dividend reinvestment plan will remain in place for the interim dividend at 2.5% discount to market price. And Auckland Airport remains committed to its A minus long-term corporate credit rating from Standard & Poor's and our dividend policy of paying circa 100% of underlying impact.\n\nWe don't have a large CapEx program to deliver over the next few years and we’ll likely be launching a domestic fixed rate bonds and/or an Australia bond over the next three months to partly fund it.\n\nSo, back to Adrian now.\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nThanks, Phil. So, I'm just going to touch on a bit of detail around the various parts of our activities. I'll start with travel and trademark, it's on Page 19. So, as we touched on before, we've actually looking at our business and comparing capacity development against passengers in that top left-hand corner. You can really see the impact of capacity dropping back, but actually passengers holding up.\n\nAnd, in fact, we’re now really comfortably above 80% loads on our analysis across both domestic and international. And it does give us some real comfort around the strength of the underlying markets. I think anytime year-to-year you can get impacts from various things. And certainly, as Phil touched on before, we've had some impacts from aircraft issues, obviously, the 707 engine issue continues, but also the 737 MAX issue globally is understood to have an impact and that's really where airlines are redeploying particularly wide-body planes on to say domestically short haul flying to fill the gap with the 737 MAXs that are on the ground.\n\nSo, look, it may be that if that – if and when that issue is resolved, that new capacity comes back into the market that will be something that we will be targeting and going after. Looking at different routes. So, if you're looking around the world, the Middle East has actually hit some good performance here, capacity ticking up, but passengers even stronger. North Asia was affected by the Hong Kong riots and changes there. And so that did see a bit of an impact from there.\n\nWe think Japan is a little bit underserved and probably could do better for more capacity was there. China, we talked about before, is obviously in the first-half pre-coronavirus, dropping back from a capacity point of view, but actually the key message is at the direct service passengers are actually growing quite healthily.\n\nSoutheast Asia has been going really well. Singapore is performing incredibly well. And we continue to see opportunity in markets like the Philippines, India and other areas. North America is another one, obviously, didn't really see the benefit of some of the new announcements in this half. They will show up over the coming halves and towards the back-end of this calendar year with markets like Vancouver, New York, and Dallas coming on Board. So, really pleasing to get those announcements from New Zealand and America.\n\nJust turning to Page 20. I just want to dive a bit deeper into the China market and some of the other dynamics going on. And just bear in mind, these are all pre-coronavirus numbers. But on the left-hand side, if we look at that nationality perspective from China, one of the headlines has been around New Zealand tourism market has been the decline of the growth rate of the China market, decline of that market.\n\nIt's really important to understand that that's – that reflects actually what's going on in direct travel. Actually direct travel to New Zealand by Chinese nationals is actually up about 5 – was up about 5.5 in the period. And that reflects that transition to premium mono destination travelers coming on the direct services.\n\nThat to me is actually an evolution in a maturing of our tourism market for that sector, like that market actually in line with what we want people who are coming, spending more time here, getting around our country. That you can also see across on the right-hand side there and the Australian market with their changing shape of the Australian market with the first freedom carriers like Emirates withdrawing from the market, Jetstar and – yes, sorry Qantas in New Zealand, sorry, Virgin in New Zealand separating out in that market changing.\n\nSo, we've seen that connecting via Australia declining and actually more point-to-point traffic there. And if I go to the bottom right, the domestic underlying demand, we do think remain solid. I think, the economy remains in pretty good shape, good underlying growth. And I guess we would track that by saying if you look at the capacity in the market, obviously, that's been declining, fewer seats being flown, but actually passenger volumes have held up a bit better than that. So that's just obviously growing load factors. Introduced underlying demand is actually in pretty good shape. Now, I do have to carry it, that – that's all pretty coronavirus.\n\nJust in that context, Page 21. Again, just paints that broader picture. Our business has been through various, both global and local events. And while we might have had a bounce or a short blip for a period, actually, the underlying markets are strong. And I actually think if I look longer-term or even medium-term; the underlying drivers remain solid with that growth in the middle class, one flight away from us. So, I think in our tourism product remaining strong also.\n\nRight, turning to Page 22 and this is a complicated story to tell, but the real story here is around the core investment and major infrastructure here. So, we are investing significant money, as Phil said, in big infrastructure assets for the long-term growth. And we're really pleased to get now – have four of our main eight anchor projects into construction, and we'll touch on that more in a minute.\n\nSo, across the current domestic terminal works and northern stands and taxiways, new international arrivals and our transport network those are all in the ground and going and that’s several of those eight anchor projects are very close to diggers in the ground as well. So, really pleased that we're keeping that machine turning.\n\nSo, I go to a bit more detail on each one of those projects. On Page 23, northern stands and taxiways, it's about six. I think rugby field’s worth of space 250,000 square meters, 350 million-plus, that's well underway now, and we're planning to bring that into operation in stages, taxiways, operational 2020 remote stands like [21].\n\nTravelers [indiscernible] can see the routing network upgrade, which is a reminder is the future transport system to enable the future integrated terminal. That's well underway, tracking really well. Team is doing a great job of keeping the traffic flowing, while that is ongoing; plan to be fully operational by mid-2021. And that will also enable public transport connectivity in a bit of walking and cycling experience for travelers with dedicated mass transit lanes for buses getting connectivity all the way through.\n\nNot on this list of our eight anchor projects is our southern network, which is also getting a big upgrade. And so we turned and saw it on our joint project with NZTA and Auckland Transport to do a mass transit line connection, all the way to the main line train station that is being upgraded at [indiscernible]. So, which for the first time will have a really integrated public transport service to the south of our city and down to the CBD. So, that's a very exciting project.\n\nWe continue to – on item three there, continue to work in our domestic terminal. We've expanded the security area there and have upgraded the retail there. So, that's going well. On item four, and really one of the announcements today at our results was the – getting the diggers in the ground on the international arrivals project, something we've been working on for sometime through an ECI [ph] process with Hawkins as main contractor, working very closely with the Border Agency.\n\nSo, enabling works actually started last year. We're about to break into video construction, and this will be a complete upgrade of the arrivals experience for international travelers to our country, a brand-new border processing experience, and a brand-new public arrivals area there.\n\nThere’s a couple of visuals there on the right-hand side. There's a great video for those Aucklanders who are keen to see what that looks like, but that will be a really dramatic upgrade. And passengers will exit that area out onto a new Plaza between the two hotels, the new one, Pullman, we are building with Tainui. So that whole experience will be a big change, as well as an integrated transport connection area right adjacent to that.\n\nSo, some big changes for customers coming through and we're planning to have that completed unlike 2023. The other big news in a similar vein is on the Domestic Jet Hub. So, it has been a challenging project, there was no question about it. And I think it's just the fact that when you are connecting in big new infrastructure into existing operations and a brown-field site, there was a lot of complexity.\n\nWe had a lot of issues to resolve how that connection happened. What was the passenger experience, the connectivity we're trying to achieve? What services and infrastructure did we have to relocate? What operations that we have to relocate to make that happen? So, we've been infected and enabling works process for some time now.\n\nOur fuel on upgrade system that is ongoing right now is underway, in line with this design, but the big news here is that, we have now progressed the design to the point we were able to form a construction alliance arrangement with two preeminent builders, New Zealand, Downer Group and Fletcher Construction, but also bringing the engineering design team from Mark McDonald into this alliance with us.\n\nSo, that's an alliance model, sort of in line with where the government construction accord had been focusing on, which brings that risk sharing in together, brings the supply chain pair of those two organizations with us with joint accountability. And I think for a project of this complexity, scale and size is appropriate and realistic for the New Zealand market.\n\nSo, we're really pinning our ears back on that one and construction specifically, on that project, will start in late 2020 and we're targeting the first stage for completion in 2023. Passengers naturally will see that benefit of being able to directly connect into one facility between Domestic Jet and our international services.\n\nTurning on to Page 26 on the other balance of our major anchor projects, Northern runway again continued excellent progress on the design and planning work on that. We've now completed the notice of requirement, the planning permissions for that and have secured that for the full length runway.\n\nThe concept design work has been progressing really well actually and some excellent work by our team on the sales and engineering and design work on that front. And obviously, we are still doing the work on the timing of it – the specific timing of that. Network is continuing and we're planning to make some announcements and updating on timing later this year.\n\nNumber 7, our multi-story car park and new transport interchange hub. Again, excellent progress on the design of that. Negotiations are ongoing around construction. We've actually isolated the site in the last few weeks and created a different passenger pathway. So, we can get into that project. And it will obviously connect them with a new Domestic Jet Hub. You obviously got to have the transport and the change to go with the terminal. That is well underway and looking to make some announcements hopefully later this year around construction commencement, but we're targeting in a completion around 2022.\n\nAnd lastly, we continue to work on our cargo, precinct and weekend the feasibility and design of those options for the future. But look, these are just eight of hundreds of different projects that are interconnected and in any other year. Those other projects would feature now on our list here, things like our fuel pipeline upgrade is a very big and complex project that's well underway and going, but we've got just hundreds of projects underway and connected to them.\n\nRight. Turning to our commercial property business on Page 27, look, the team is still running really hard and fast and doing a great job. We're continuing to tune out high-quality development class-leading assets in the industrial and commercial sector, and it's showing up in results. We continue to lift down, annualize rent roll now to $105 million on an annualized basis, occupancy is strong and [Walt] is lengthening and we still got 200-plus [hectors] to develop.\n\nWe also are continuing our speculative program, continuing to bring in the multi-use or dedicated facilities, where we see them, but we're also getting great re-contracting from existing tenants like DHL and Hellman and it continues to go really well. And obviously, listeners to this call also remember that we've got two hotels under development, a Mercure four-star hotel, which is tracking really well, in fact, and in the five-star Pullman hotel outside the front door of the terminal in partnership with Tainui Group Holdings about the tracking to plan and budget.\n\nPage 28 just talking about a terminal and operations. We continue to work hard on our capacity and effectiveness. We've rolled out some new services around automated border processes with pre-security gates. We continue to roll out our pre-check and check-in kiosks and starting to spread that around a precinct stepping out of the terminal itself into Novotel hotel and Park & Ride, so people can check-in before they arrive physically to the terminal and we’re continuing to upgrade different areas around passenger immunity.\n\nIn the broader experience, we continue to work with FSIC to bring some innovation around different passenger pathways, the family line and the prepaid passenger line to try and speed up their process and also expand in some of their processing areas and continue to invest in the technology to help people plan for the journey.\n\nSo, launched our home to gate feature on our app, the big upgrade to our online services, which also allows people to see processing times with border security, aviation security, and the like, so they can plan their journey, continue to work on us for the future. We're looking at automatic backdrops now and other real-time reporting for our partners. So, they can help optimize the whole airport system for efficiency in a better customer experience.\n\nPage 29, just quickly touching on our consumer business. Retails continue to perform well, despite the moderating passenger growth, completed a lot of those projects in the terminal at international. As I said before, we've had that good uplift and spin rates and actually quite pleasing performance in terms of sales and their core categories with Duty Free PSR up 7% across the period.\n\nThe online and multichannel work continues to grow as we learn that business and test out new ideas. Transactions have grown 55% in the second-half compared to the prior period. And we've launched our WeChat Mall and we're testing out different direct shipments to China angles and there's some interesting ideas in there.\n\nWith the first airport, I think to bring both WeChat Pay and Alipay functionality into one payment window for airports globally. So, that's a – it’s a great feature and something that we know our customers are looking for and our domestic terminals continue to lift with our food and beverage upgrades.\n\nOn transport, page 30. Again, some moves and changes there with new capacity coming in, both in self park and valet, valet has gone very strongly and we have been using that as a method just to upgrade people to give them a better experience, but also to manage capacity a bit more and that's led to a strong lift in valet growth.\n\nAnd we've got some big new capacity coming on with a new Park & Ride South facility the ground is broken on that, I didn't mention it earlier. It’s about 3,200 car parks coming on in late 2020, which will coincide and is working in with the NZTA 20B project. That will also be available also for construction staff as well, as well as the multilevel car parking outside the front door, the Tainui I mentioned before.\n\nFinally, just talking to our people and our place in the world look really pleasing from a customer experience point of view to see some of the upgrades that have already come through really showing up and customer satisfaction scores. So, our surveyed scores have really been performing well, despite some of the disruption and I think people are starting to see the benefits of the upgrades.\n\nSo that's great to see that flow through some high results here, as well as some of those core metrics that people care around, around baggage recline time, busing movements dropping down and improving there.\n\nFrom a safety and sustainability point of view, we are committed to that. We continue and have for many, many years, focus on our place in the world and how we can minimize our impact through our program. And we're applying those building standards as we go through, but really pleasing to see the focus on safety coming through. It's going to be critical for us through this project phase that we're running around having this focus on safety. So, great to see a decrease, such a big decrease in recordable injury rate, but also the increase in reporting.\n\nAnd then finally, we truly believe in the opportunity that a multibillion dollar program can offer to this part of South Auckland. And so ADA, which is our jobs and skills hub in partnership with the government, is really still paying really big dividends, and we are hosting many jobs exposed to put local people into local jobs and it's something we're really committed to.\n\nSo, with that, I'll pause there and I know that's a lot. We are very busy as you can pick up. Lots going on, but it’s a really exciting time for us at the airport, and happy to turn now to any questions.\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Andy Bowley from Forsyth Barr. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Bowley\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning, Adrian. Good morning, Phil. I've got a couple of questions. First, around the development pipeline, and specifically around the northern runway, you made reference to reviewing the timing of the Northern runway in your presentation, but no reference to the runway land charge. So, I guess, in that context, can you give us a probability of you imposing the runway land charge from 1st of July this year?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nYes, I'm sorry. In term of timing, we're working that through on our Board Strategy Day in April and again, looking for a Board decision in May. So that decision isn't yet made, I think as we have discussed with a few investors, analysts over the last few months, the likelihood of that kicking off the runway land charge from FY 2021, as we previously expected, is clearly diminishing. And we would expect that the timing of the runway itself commissioning is going to be somewhere in the early 2030s rather than 2028 that we've been talking about previously.\n\nAndy Bowley\n\nGreat. Thanks, Phil. So, the second question, again, reference to the presentation, I recognize you don't have a crystal ball, but what do you think that potential impact on non-China passengers could be from coronavirus? And I guess, how much do you expect non-Chinese Asian routes to be down as a result, recognizing things could deteriorate from here, but you made specific reference to non-Chinese Asian routes in the presentation? Could you elaborate a little bit more?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nYes. I don't really want to get into the detailed assumptions there, Andy. The reality is we really don't know any more than anybody else does on how the coronavirus is going to pan out. It's fair to say that we're seeing very little, if any contagion on other international destinations other than Asia. And it's almost exclusively on direct flights to China at present, as well as through traffic transiting through China.\n\nWe are expecting that there will be some material impact on other Asian ports, but that all rolls up into our $10 million after-tax impact. The reality is on those individual assumptions will be wrong individually on all of them. But we do believe that that $10 million impact is a very sound is based on current information.\n\nAndy Bowley\n\nYes. So, just digging down into that, so Adrian mentioned Singapore in terms of Singapore government increasing investment in the tourism sector, see this week the Singapore Airlines started cutting back capacity. What are other airlines saying to you about the demand outlook in terms of what they can see in their bookings?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nI think, Andy, there's no question they're sort of saying the forwards are looking a little softer. And I think what they don't know is, potentially people are leaving the decision quite late in terms of whether like cancel an existing booking, and that's why it's really hard to tell and even hard for them to judge. So, basically, as Phil seeders reflected on our numbers here, but I think we should expect it to be a bit lumpy over the next few months. So, we just need to keep reading the data as it comes out.\n\nAndy Bowley\n\nYes. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Wade Gardiner from Craig Investment Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nHi, guys. The first question, $300 million pipeline for property development. I mean, I think that's similar to what you've seen in the past, but can you just give us an idea of what we're going to see during FY 2020 and sort of how that $300 million got spent over the preceding years?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nWe'll have to come back to you on any sort of detail breakdown on that Wade, but it’s fair to say what we should say is that’s what we know at the moment. We do have an ambitious investment property growth strategy. So, we're looking at all sorts of opportunities at the moment, all of which have strong ROI potential, all of them a long way of board approval at this stage, but I think big picture, if the things go according to the perspective opportunities you could see the run rate increase going forward from the past.\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nAnd Wade just a note, that $300 million is excluding the Pullman Hotel.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nOkay. Just drilling down a little bit into the cost lines, can you give a bit of a color on the professional services and your other line for costs and therefore what we should expect from those in the second-half?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nA big picture, we expect ongoing cost control, obviously, that's the most immediate lever that we have in terms of the overall P&L out term. So, we would expect the full-year out term in total OpEx to be the growth rate to decline a little bit from what you saw at the half year.\n\nIf you – in terms of what's in other expenses, just bear with me a sec. We did have a couple of one-offs in the last period, which haven’t been repeated this period. So, we had a bad debt in relation to one of our international terminal retailers that’s exited, as well as a small write-down on asset disposal to make way for our terminal exit road. So that won't be repeated in other categories that fall in the likes of staff travel. And, of course, that’s another area of focus for us at the moment.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nWhat about professional service phase, which was way lower this period?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nYes. So, we – I mean, you would have observed that we have been growing headcount over the last probably at least two years and there’s been a focus on building that institutional knowledge and expertise and housing more of what were previously outsourced. So, again, strong controls here. The consultancy is across a whole range of factors. There's dozens of things that we've had consultants assist us with, but as I mentioned on ongoing focus going forward.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nOkay. So, the sort of that close to [3 million to half] is the more likely run rate going here rather than sort of the – sort of four or five that we've seen in the past?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nThat’s our plan.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nOkay. Next question, just given the runway issues in the last couple of months, can you just give a bit of color on that and I guess with a confident that it's being remediated and we're not going to see this an ongoing problem?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nYes, Wade, Adrian here. Yes, look, absolutely. And so as we see this today, and we've also had that just independently checked in reviewed just to have complete confidence in that. So, we absolutely getting on with it. We have a standard process of private management that runs across the entire airfield.\n\nYes, there are some areas that as part of our exit replacement program have been scheduled for works, covering about 5% of the airfield runway area and now are going to be programmed and going and those have been notified to the airlines over time. And so yes, that program maintenances I can tell you comprehensive and in a very robust and we’ll just need to work our way through the ongoing replacement program after time.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nAny reason why it occurred and other than just bad luck or it wasn't a case of delayed maintenance or anything like that?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nWell, actually, the review said that the recent unusually hot and dry weather we've had in Auckland was a contributor to thermal expansion fairly, which sort of means it's a – it was a new thing that we hadn't seen previously before. So, that's been a real focus over the last couple of weeks in terms of the review to make sure that we are accounting for that in terms of our planning and our maintenance programs, and that has all been put into place.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nOkay. And finally, for me, just, I know that you don't necessarily want to – around the coronavirus, yet, necessarily know what's going to happen here, but can you just give a color around, I mean, you put some – you've clearly made some assumptions around what you're expecting around businesses. But specifically, what have you assumed in terms of the Chinese visitor ban and when that end?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nWell, I think just really roughly right. So, there's no question impact heavily in February and March, late drifting probably into April and their gradual recovery into May and June from there. I mean, that's our beasty summit at the stage. Just a reminder, we had 45 services probably expected this time of year. We've now got between 8 and 11, but it is a little bit variable. So – but we are really started saying close to the Chinese Airlines.\n\nAnd look, one of the things we are discussing with them actively is actually also Air Cargo, because in terms of the recovery and the return, Air Cargo could come back quite quickly as supply chains are constrained in New Zealand. We know we're starting to hear a lot, because the factories haven't been tuning in China.\n\nSo, enough people have urging gaps fill on their supply chains, we may see a big rush on Air Cargo, which could actually help those routes to slowly rebuild around passenger volumes as well. So, that's been in a real topic of discussion in the last week or so with the carriers.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nOkay. So, from that it’s fair to say that, that your assumptions are in the visitor ban it ends call it, within the next couple of weeks?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nLook, we haven't specifically gone to that. We focused on some rough, high-level assumptions around how long an impact will last, but look, we would expect it to run for some time yet, but it will be very much dependent, I think, on my judgment is based on what our partners like Australia do.\n\nAnd I think you can get some sense that they are looking at it closely and that they shortened the review window from – the window from 14 days to 8. I think the government – both governments I know are very, very mindful of the impact on the respective economies. So, they're watching it closely from a health point of view.\n\nWade Gardiner\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Marcus Cleary from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nMarcus Cleary\n\nGood morning, gentlemen. Just a few, could you talk a little bit about the domestic terminal project? I suppose, I take note that it's now a billion-dollar-plus project, where I suppose last time you saw the CapEx system, I thought it was around $700 million. And could you also talk to the comments around staging? Yes, it looks like from the comments that this is now going to be, yes, delivered in phases. And so how much of the investment should we expect to turn up in the next control period?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nSo yes, just starting with the numbers. So, if you drill into our schedule 2018 from our original price hitting disclosure in 2017, there were two line items that covered the domestic terminal. So, that was one that was, I think, called something very close to domestic terminal and there was another one, both of them referred to Phase 5, which is our internal name for that project. The other category of stains and aprons, and in nominal dollars, each of them was $720 million in just under $300 million, which takes you to a bit over $1 billion.\n\nNow, we can't give you a specific number at the moment. We're working through where there alliance on the target out to end cost and won't be until we've completed that process or have a clear view on the ultimate cost estimate.\n\nOn staging, what we – the way we plan our infrastructures after delivery to have forecast capacity for somewhere between 5 and 10 years depending on the infrastructure we're talking about. So, while the domestic terminal completion in roundabout 2023, that's going to cover our capacity needs until 2028.\n\nMarcus Cleary\n\nSorry, can I just ask one further here? So, is it right to assume that the billion-dollars turns up in the PSE4 aeronautical CapEx, or should we read into this. And I suppose I did read into your aeronautical report that with negotiations with the airlines, you've decided to split this project into phases to make it more palatable, I suppose in terms of the cost?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nYes.\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nYes. So, the billion-dollar-plus that'll be the actual CapEx spend itself will be concentrated over late PSE3, early PSE4 and commissioned we're targeting in calendar 2023, any further CapEx will be outside of PSE4, so they're beyond FY 2027.\n\nMarcus Cleary\n\nSo, yes, so the $4 billion is still expected to turn up and the airport charges in PSE4?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nThat's right, fairly in PSE4.\n\nMarcus Cleary\n\nAnd secondly, can you talk a little bit to, yes, the performances of your Duty Free operators, obviously, last time they provided public statements, yet, both of them were unprofitable. Yes, has there been any discussions? Do you have any visibility in terms of how they're traveling at the moment? And your views around risks, yes, for them as the concession holders?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nSo, I think, as you see last time, Marcus mixture, and again, as I said previously, this sort of repeats. We were in the last contracting cycle. One is performing well and going in line with expectations, the other one still got some work to do in a furious, but they're working hard at that. There's obviously global considerations for them in terms of the longer-term plans, but not – Duty Free actually performed very well on the periods. And so we're very happy with how they performed.\n\nMarcus Cleary\n\nAnd can you remind us, obviously, the expansion of certain phases? Yes, when is the next review of the concession for Duty Free?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nYes. I have a 2022, 2023.\n\nMarcus Cleary\n\nThank you. And then just finally, so is it a reasonable step up in capitalized interest in the half. I suppose if you’re annualizing that for the full-year. I suppose it did surprise me a little, given the modest amount of CapEx that’s been done. Could you just give a little bit of perspective around what's happening there and what we should expect?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nYes. And this is notoriously difficult to forecast. I imagine you share a pain on capitalized interest and depreciation. I think at the annual results announcement back in August, we guided an uplift in depreciation and interest for the full-year of $10 million. We have had more capitalized interest, so delay in commissioning dates versus the budget that we work that off. So we would expect those two categories together to be more like $5 million up or and FY 2020 versus FY 2019.\n\nMarcus Cleary\n\nAnd is that just for capitalized interest, that sounds like a, yes, and assure on timing that’s limited to this year, or yes, does that expand in the future years?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nWhat – sorry, our forecast in our previous guidance related only to FY 2020, but we expect to have growing works under construction going forward over the next couple of years. So, the level of capitalized interest should continue to increase.\n\nMarcus Cleary\n\nYes, I understand. Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Adam Fleck from Morningstar. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Fleck\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. As a follow-up on the Duty Free performance and the coronavirus impacts, obviously, retail saw TSRs in the period, but slowing in international – revenue per international passenger. So, how much of that estimated $10 million in impact do you expect to come from retail? Is that a concern here in the near-term?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nSo, the next big picture is roughly two-thirds, aeronautical one-third [indiscernible], and then that [indiscernible] is split across categories like our Strata Lounge, that's a VIP lounge that's owned by Auckland Airport, off-airport retail, transport likes of car parking in taxis, Uber, et cetera. And for retail to the extent that we're trading above [Meg] that takes a little bit of a hit that big picture of two-thirds aeronautical, one-third retail.\n\nAdam Fleck\n\nOkay, great. That’s helpful context. Thank you. And then just wanted to follow-up on drilling down into Queenstown a little bit, obviously, the strength we've seen there is impressive, particularly in the international traffic numbers. How do you balance in your discussions with them? The share gain, it seems like they're heading on the trans-Tasman routes with the performance of travelers into Auckland specifically?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nLook, it is something we consider, but I guess, our focus is on growing our markets. I think, our share of total international market has held pretty firmly, maybe just dropped down a touch. So, they are targeting, particularly the Aussie market. A lot of the long haul premium international travel markets connect through here. And that's why I think they reasonably complement each other well as assets. So, I think it can work quite well together, but they have their own independent Board and they have their own objectives that they're going after.\n\nAdam Fleck\n\nSure, sure. Okay. Alright. Great. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Suraj Nebhani from Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nSuraj Nebhani\n\nGood morning, guys. Just a quick one. So, the $10 million impact that was called out for the coronavirus, so that’s, call it, 4% impact to FY 2020, but the guidance was down rated by only 2% at the midpoint. So, I'm just wondering what's driving the underlying upgrade?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nYes. I think we've just touched on that. So, we – we've had a lower interest expense than what we originally guided on that explains most of that [implicit upgrade].\n\nSuraj Nebhani\n\nOkay. Thanks for that. So, just thinking about that $10 million, I guess, we analyze that, that's roughly 8% annualized impact. So, should we think of that as the base case estimate for like a go-forward basis, if things don't improve in the near-term?\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nWell, I think it'd be too early to call that. I think, we really got to wait to see how things unfold. We're still some way from the end of this financial year before we start to look at how that flows through to the next year. And look, what we have seen and I'm not suggesting this will happen, but in the following years, after an event like this, you can see a reasonable bounce. So, well, let's just wait to see how it unfolds to the balance this year and how quickly markets return.\n\nSuraj Nebhani\n\nOkay, thanks for that. And just finally, can you talk about traffic and what are you seeing year-to-date? Obviously, you haven't released January data, but just interested in some trends like how has the traffic been in January, for example?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nYes. Look, obviously, flattish in this year. And just like some international, flattish this year following several years of rapid growth. We've been around all our carriers in this half speaking with them, focusing on the current routes, focusing on future. And look, I think, as I said on a earlier meeting with analysts that, I was expecting a bit more neutral, maybe the negative in terms of the sentiment in the outlook, but actually, at that stage the outlook is actually neutral to positive on a lot of our route.\n\nSo, we're actually able to engage with the carriers and sort of future focused growth opportunities, optimization, frequency, gauge, discussions, which I think is really pleasing. And look, towards the end of the year, we obviously saw the announcements around Dallas with American direct, New Zealand direct in New York.\n\nSo, I’ll then also get back to the loads that we're seeing across domestic and international. They are remaining very strong, and very high, and the airlines are doing a great job of filling the planes, but that also indicates that new capacity would be supported by underlying demand.\n\nSo, I think those are good prospects for the future. And I also remain optimistic about New Zealand's tourism proposition, I think, our offer of a welcoming culture and open culture and a fantastic location is where the future tourism consumer is going. And good news is New Zealand has always been there. So, I remain positive at the long-term outlook for tourism.\n\nSuraj Nebhani\n\nOkay. Thanks for that, Adrian. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Shane Solly from Harbour Asset Management. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nShane Solly\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for the rundown. So, apologies, but I just want to go back to the team now, can you break down how you arrived at the $10 million for Covid, please?\n\nPhil Neutze\n\nNo. So, we're not going to go into detail on that, as I mentioned earlier, any of our estimates individually will be wrong. Big Picture though, we thought it was important to give the market our central view on the head to underlying profit. I guess, analysts can test your own assumptions and calibrate them against that $10 million, probably what I'd advise, but as I mentioned, two-thirds aeronautical, one-third [indiscernible].\n\nShane Solly\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no other questions as of the moment. Presenters, please continue.\n\nAdrian Littlewood\n\nWell, thanks, everyone, for joining us for the call and look forward to catching up with those of you we're going to have do reconversations with. Have a great day. Thank you."

Genesis has four business segments. The Offshore Pipeline Transportation services segment is engaged in providing the critical infrastructure to move oil produced from the long-lived world-class reservoirs from the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico to onshore refining centers.\n\nSamantha, would you please check to see that the Internet connection is on?\n\nUnidentified Speaker\n\nIt is on.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. The Sodium Minerals and Sulfur Services segment includes trona and trona-based exploring, mining, processing, producing, marketing and selling activities as well as the processing of sour gas streams to remove sulfur at refining operations. The Onshore Facilities and Transportation segment is engaged in the transportation, handling, blending, storage and supply of energy products, including crude oil and refined products.\n\nThe Marine Transportation segment is engaged in the maritime transportation of primarily refined petroleum products. Genesis operations are primarily located in Wyoming, the Gulf Coast states and the Gulf of Mexico. During this conference call, management may be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nThe law provides safe harbor protection to encourage companies to provide forward-looking information. Genesis intends to avail itself of those safe harbor provisions and directs you to its most recently filed and future filings with the Securities Exchange Commission. We also encourage you to visit our website at genesisenergy.com, where a copy of the press release we issued today is located. The press release also presents a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Grant Sims, CEO of Genesis Energy, L.P. Mr. Sims will be joined by Bob Deere, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Sims, Senior Vice President Finance and Corporate Development.\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. For the quarter, our diversified businesses in total performed slightly better than our expectations and we ended the year toward the high end of our revised annual guidance for adjusted EBITDA. In our offshore pipeline transportation segment, we saw strong volumes across our platforms and pipelines as newer projects continue to ramp and subsea tiebacks and infill drilling more than offset any natural decline from our dedicated fields.\n\nDuring the quarter, we announced new contracts with Murphy Exploration & Production Company, USA, subsidiary of Murphy Oil to support their operated Khaleesi/Mormont and Samurai field developments through the new King's Quay floating production system. The King's Quay FPS will have the capacity to produce up to 80,000 barrels per day of oil and up 100 million cubic feet of gas per day from the field development starting in mid 2022.\n\nThe King's Quay FPS will tie-in subsea to our 100% owned Shenzi lateral and the crude oil production will then be delivered 50% to our 100% owned Cameron Highway system and 50% to our 64% owned Poseidon crude oil system for delivery all the way to shore. The associated gas production will tie-in subsea and be gathered on our 100% owned Anaconda system which ties in to our 25.67% owned Nautilus gas system for transportation to shore.\n\nGiven the multiple opportunities for Genesis to handle both the oil and gas production from the King's Quay FPS and if their producers are able to achieve their anticipated volumes, we would reasonably expect to see a benefit of approximately $50 million to $60 million of annual incremental EBITDA associated with the King's Quay FPS.\n\nDuring the quarter, the producing community also made a couple of significant announcements in the Gulf of Mexico. Chevron announced their final investment decision or FID to sanction their $5.7 billion anchor project in Green Canyon. Talos Energy announced they were acquiring a broad portfolio of Gulf of Mexico producing assets, exploration prospects and acreage from a variety of smaller companies for approximately $640 million. We believe all of these announcements are indicative of the near, medium and long-term opportunity sets in the Gulf of Mexico and that the economics and production profiles of these projects are competing favorably against other opportunities sets in the Company's portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, significant upstream players are seemingly dismissing any political uncertainty around the future of the Gulf of Mexico in 2021 and for decades to come. Our team continues to finalize agreements to move the total of what is anticipated to be an incremental 20,000 barrels per day to 25,000 barrels per day of new production on Poseidon. These volumes are expected to come online in mid-2020 and will be life of lease dedications from several new tie back developments, that will flow through one of our wholly owned laterals that connect subsea into Poseidon.\n\nIn addition, we expect to see volumes from BP's Atlantis Phase 3 development in the second half of 2020, and we'll benefit from a full year production from LLOG's Buckskin development this year. No capital will be required by us to provide these incremental movements in 2020.\n\nAs a result, we remain on track with our third quarter comments and reasonably expecting segment margin in our offshore pipeline transportation segment to be up approximately $20 million to $30 million year-over-year in 2020. As a reminder, these incremental volumes in 2020 are in advance of BP's Argos production facility which is scheduled to come online in mid-to-late 2021 and Murphy's King's Quay FBS, which we just talked about, which is scheduled to come online in mid-2022, both of which will have a meaningful positive impact on our offshore pipeline transportation segment margin going forward.\n\nLooking out longer-term, we remain in active discussions with multiple producers regarding potential new developments that could come online in the 2023-2025 timeframe. These opportunities would be similar in size and scale as other recently announced projects, and could represent meaningful midterm opportunities for us including discretionary extensions and expansion of our existing assets.\n\nWe would reasonably expect these producers to come to an FID on these new developments sometime over the next 12 months to 24 months. However, unless and until the parties enter into a definitive agreement, there is no direct guarantee that we will be successful in capturing some or any of these volumes. In our onshore facilities and transportation segment, we experienced a ramp in crude by rail volumes throughout the quarter, as a result of curtailment relief granted in Alberta and we exited the year averaging approximately one train a day. We have experienced a continued ramp above that in January and February and have received nominations for March consistent with the first several months of this year.\n\nWe have seen and expect no significant slow down or changes to volumes as a result of operating conditions on either the Canadian Pacific or the Canadian National railroads. Furthermore, we have not seen any impacts from a fire at Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery last week. We continue to monitor all these situations to see if they might potentially impact volumes in the first half of 2020, but at this point we expect none.\n\nDuring the quarter, we also saw increased volumes on our Texas pipeline as a result of increased offshore volumes that feed our Texas City terminal. We remain encouraged with the additional activity in and around the Texas City and Houston markets, and believe there will be opportunities to further optimize our onshore pipelines and terminals with the increasing volumes from our offshore pipelines.\n\nOur Marine Transportation segment continued to perform as expected and reported increased segment margin for the eighth consecutive quarter. We experienced strong utilization and improving fundamentals and day rates across our inland and offshore fleets. IMO 2020 appears to be having a positive impact on our inland, black oil barges as refiners need to get the intermediate refined barrel to the right location.\n\nUpwards of 90% of our barges are typically contracted to provide services to refiners moving their intermediate products from one location to another. The Corps of Engineers is undertaking significant repair and maintenance of locks on the Mississippi River and its major tributaries this summer. As a result, we anticipate a near-term reduction in, quote-unquote practical supply, as movements in and out of such region take longer and are less efficient than normal.\n\nAs a result, demand and day-rates in our brown water fleet should improve. We are also seeing increased demand for our blue water vessels. Our offshore fleet is benefiting from certain competitive dynamics on the East Coast as well as more required product movements because of the closure of refining capacity in Philadelphia.\n\nOur larger offshore vessels are benefiting from increased movements of crude oil as more and more barrels reach the Gulf Coast, where the Gulf Coast refiners basically have limited incremental demand for those types of barrels. Turning to our sodium and sulfur services segment, our legacy refinery services business performed as expected in the quarter, and importantly it appears most of the production and market interruptions it faced in the second half of '19 are largely behind us as we move into 2020. Excuse me -- As we mentioned on our third quarter call, we were then seeing signs of slowdown in demand for soda ash globally, particularly in Asia.\n\nWe believe this was tied mainly to the ongoing uncertainty around the US-China trade war, but also to decelerating GDP resulting from tightening monetary policies by most central banks in early 2019, which policies appears to have been reversed in the second half of last year. Nonetheless, this demand trend accelerated into the end of the quarter as customers continued to be longer [Phonetic] and respective finished goods, like flat glass and soda ash inventory. At the same time, it appears that Genesis and the other US producers made and marketed more soda ash in the last quarter compared to the years earlier quarters.\n\nAs a result, price fell in the export markets to clear this demand/supply imbalance, and we experienced our lowest quarter of financial contribution from our soda ash operations, of just over $38 million, since we acquired the business in 2017. Unfortunately, most prices for the subsequent year are negotiated in the preceding December and January timeframe. Even though most domestic prices are set on a multi-year basis, many subject to caps and collars, our export contracts and negotiated prices are much shorter in duration.\n\nGiven the dynamics going into the price negotiations described above, we expect export prices, which represent approximately half of our total annual sales, to be significantly lower in 2020 than they have been in the prior 2.5 years since we acquired the operations. Experience has shown, because of the nature of the mix of contracts, it can take anywhere from four quarters to eight quarters for the underlying fundamentals to get back on historical trends.\n\nDuring the first quarter 2020, we have continued to monitor the impacts from the coronavirus in China and the potential impact that may have on synthetic production of soda ash demand in the region. China like the US, is a net exporter of soda ash and synthetic production out of China competes head-to-head with exports in natural production from the US. It is too early to tell -- to determine the net effects of reduced supply from and reduce demand in China and potentially reduce demand from other economies throughout Asia.\n\nHaving said that, we continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of the business and the cost competitive advantage natural soda ash enjoys over synthetically produced product. We remain confident that the market will need, and we can easily and profitably place the incremental tons coming from our Granger expansion beginning in mid-2022.\n\nAccording to third party reports, soda ash demand outside of China is estimated to increase approximately 4 million tons between 2019 and 2023 and approximately 9 million tons between 2019 and 2028.\n\nTo put it in perspective, our Granger expansion of an incremental 700,000-or-so tons per year represents less than 20% of the estimated demand increase between now and 2023 and only some 8% of the estimated demand increase through 2028.\n\nFurthermore, some of our competitors including but not limited to Solvay and general resources are also seeing these global demand forecast and thus have announced our own respective natural production expansions that would add incremental natural production to the market over the next few years. Even with all of these proposed expansions, natural gas production is expected to represent somewhere between 25% and 30% of overall supply to the global market, thus requiring higher cost synthetic production to be produced to satisfy the increasing future demand.\n\nTherefore, we're confident that prices will rise over the period of 2019 to 2028. While our soda ash business will no doubt be significantly weaker this year, our belief in the longer term fundamentals reinforce our view. We will work through these broader economic uncertainties and get back to the historical trend line for demand growth and pricing.\n\nAs we look beyond 2020, we have a very good line of sight on significantly improving financial performance. First, we would reasonably expect our existing soda ash operations to return to trend and add some $40 million or $50 million a year by 2022 at the latest. Argos is scheduled to come on-line in the second half of 2021, which represents potentially $30 million to $40 million of incremental annualized EBITDA. King's Quay is scheduled to come on-line in the first half of 2022, which represents potentially $50 million to $60 million of incremental annualized EBITDA.\n\nFinally, assuming a return to trend on soda ash pricing, the Granger expansion is expected to add potentially $60 million of incremental annualized EBITDA beginning in mid-2022. Therefore, given a starting point of being very close to cash flow neutral this year as we described in the earnings release and taking into account the meaningful new EBITDA discussed above, we believe we will be able to de-lever our balance sheet and restore and maintain our financial flexibility to capitalize on future discretionary opportunities.\n\nAs always, we intend to be prudent, diligent and intelligent in achieving and maintaining the financial flexibility to allow the partnership to opportunistically build long-term value for all our stakeholders without ever losing our commitment to safe, reliable and responsible operations. As always, we'd like to recognize the efforts and commitment of all those with whom we are fortunate enough to work.\n\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the moderator for any questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni.\n\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe we can start off with the soda ash guidance for this year and I do appreciate all the color that you gave. I was trying to understand how you're accounting for the coronavirus. Is it -- are you saying from where you are right now, you're basically accounting for the worst of the inventory builds right now and that in theory China's position as a net exporter could add, if they [Indecipherable] recovers faster, [Indecipherable] recovery or so of some form that, that could make things better or worse from where you are? I'm just trying to understand how we should be thinking about the impact given that China is a net exporter?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAt this point, our implied guidance on soda ash is independent of any effects of the coronavirus. We just don't know export data out of China is do -- generally speaking we're good at the 20th to the 24th after the sub-preceding month and so we just haven't seen it yet. So we do know that there are several large synthetic soda ash production facilities in Wuhan province, which we would anticipate are completely shutdown. But again, we don't know the net effect within the dynamics within the Chinese economy.\n\nSo as you stated or asked in the question, yes, the kind of the US domestic exporters' coming out typically the Pacific Northwest, the marginal competition is with synthetic production coming out of China into the non-China Asian markets.\n\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nOkay. So in fact the real way to think about it, as long as they're -- the net exporting position stays roughly the same, even if their imports are down a lot. But if their exports are down a lot as well too, the impact could be effectively muted and we should sort of be thinking of more of the global market. Is that sort of the right way to think about it?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe think that's sort of the right way to think about it at this point.\n\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nOkay, great. Just two follow-up questions. If I remember correctly from your prepared remarks, you sort of talked about two -- $620 million of cash outflows for this year. I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the assumptions, I'm trying to understand, is the Granger JV fully funded from a capex perspective for 2020 and that's why the outflows are that low?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThat's correct. We believe that the -- given the structure of the redeemable preferred that we put in place that it doesn't stress the internal balance sheets, there's no cash payments associated with that during the construction period. And the sources of the funds are under draws under if you will, or issuance of the redeemable preferred.\n\nSo as we look at it and how we manage the business and how our banks think about it also is basically there are recurring obligations for -- in the zip code with $620 million and that includes all of the cash taxes, senior secured interest expense, all of the run rate on the senior unsecured on the bond complex, maintenance capital spent, the preferred distributions and common distribution.\n\nSo on top of that, we have around $25 million worth of -- as we said around $25 million worth of budgeted growth capital and around $20 million of AROs, which are really kind of non-recurring and it's -- the majority of which is associated with an asset, which we think that we can sell either by the end of '21 or certainly, I mean, 2020 or certainly in 2021 and a multiple of those encouraged. So kind of at the mid-point of our EBITDA guidance that's where we think that we are cash flow neutral.\n\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And one final question if I may. If I recall, you did a big financing earlier this year. If you reduced all of your upcoming maturities and reduced your credit facility balances to almost zero, is that sort of a correct characterization that there's really no maturity or lingering type of issues that we need to be thinking about it in the near-term while you go through the soda ash issue?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe senior secured facility as it currently exists has a term going through, I think May of 2022 and the first maturity of a bond is sometime in 2023. I'm not sure what month in 2023, so what we did with the refinancing was basically issue 28s and called the 22s and stuck them at the end of the maturity ladder.\n\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nAnd you took down your balance on your revolver as well?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nNo. It was basically equal to the issuance that we redeemed.\n\nShneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Perfect. Alright, thank you very much. That does it for me.\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kyle May.\n\nKyle May -- Capital One Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. I wanted to ask about your assumptions for crude-by-rail volumes coming out of Canada. Based on the information in the press release, it sounded kind of lumpy through the year. So just wondering if you could walk us through your assumptions and then how we should think about this segment of the business beyond 2020?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, it in part is why we ranged the overall EBITDA here. I think as we said on the third quarter call, if we just average one train a day, which is approximately 70,000 barrels a day for the year of 2020, we would expect everything else the same, that the contribution margin from onshore facilities and transportation would be $10 million higher than it was in 2019.\n\nSo we are ranging it a little bit as you look in the aggregate from the $640 million to $680 million. At this point, as we said in the prepared remarks and the press release, we have a clear visibility through the first quarter, but we've not yet received nominations for April. And given just the dynamics of pipelining out of Canada, as we mentioned in the press releases, there's less diluent required and therefore there's more capacity in the second and third quarter typically. And so we don't know yet how that may or may not affect the economics. But suffice it to say, in the first quarter we're averaging over the 70 kbd i.e., over the one train a day and we would expect that in the fourth quarter also, we're just a little bit uncertain on the second and third quarter.\n\nKyle May -- Capital One Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then appreciate the EBITDA contribution you provided for some of the long-dated projects. But just wondering if you can give us an update on your thinking around the leverage ratio projections or when you may hit some of the targets you have in mind?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, what we didn't kind of expect was the -- while we consider it to be a cyclical fall and contribution of soda ash which we'll recover, but, so if, again, if you kind of do the arithmetic, actually in 2021 or 2022 with the addition of the everything that we threw out there with and everything else the same, and we would, there's close to $200 million of incremental EBITDA. So if everything else is the same, you can kind of get your hands around the arithmetic of being paying down cash, at the same time the denominator of trailing EBITDA is increasing.\n\nSo it's probably in the -- kind of the '21, '22 type timeframe that we start getting down into the low 4% from our perspective of managing the leverage calculation or the leverage covenant.\n\nKyle May -- Capital One Securities, Inc. -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Got it. That's all from me. Thank you.\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of TJ Schultz.\n\nTJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning. Just a follow up on soda ash, you mentioned I think due to the mix of contracts that a recovery historically can take from four to eight quarters, so with that, you point to a recovery in cash flow by 2022. So are you locked-in now for the next two years or could you reset contracts at the end of this year and 2021 is kind of still to be determined?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, it's a good question and I will put some more color around it. As I said in the -- as we said in the prepared remarks, and in the press release, the domestic contracts are typically under -- call it two to three, sometimes five-year contracts, most of which are subject to annual redeterminations. And most of those are subject to a caps and collars around the pricing. So those are kind of fixed if you will within a band for a period of time.\n\nAs a general proposition, as I said, half of our sales go to export markets. And then, this is very general, but half of it goes -- half of that, so a quarter of the total sales go into Latin America, which typically are one-year contracts. Not all, but typically are one-year contracts, and then the other half of the exports or a quarter of total sales go into Asia and those are typically three to six month contracts.\n\nSo in any given year, contract year, the only thing that can really move or be redetermined primarily and then this is very general, but are the agent contracts if you will, but then after four quarters and you can reset the Latin American contracts to the higher price. So I'll just give a little historical perspective, I'm not going to talk about the absolute price levels, because I'm uncomfortable doing that, given that there are only five domestic suppliers and other -- we have other arrangements for exports through ANSAC.\n\nBut the -- in the last two occurrences where we saw export prices dip this low within 12 months, prices had recovered 15% within the subsequent 12 months they had recovered an additional 12% to 15%. So I think that, that's why we said typically we've seen historically that it takes -- it can take because of the nature of the contracting and the terms can take four to eight quarters before we can get back on trend.\n\nTJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nOkay, great. Thanks for that. I have just two quick clarification on some of the guidance you gave for 2020. First, what's the maintenance capex to be spent for 2020 that you include in the cash obligations? And then, what cash flow impact in 2020 is there from recontracting the Phoenix? Thanks.\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe maintenance capital spent as currently budgeted is around $60 million to be spent in 2020. The American Phoenix, I would say in today's market probably, but it's directionally correct, because six or nine months ago it was probably $20,000 a day of recontracting risk. I would say today it's somewhere in the order, if they were to reprice in today's market, I think it's probably close to a $5,000 a day. So not a large -- in the overall scheme of things, not a large amount of recontracting risk.\n\nTJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks, Grant.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal.\n\nSunil Sibal -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\n\nYes. Hi. Good morning guys. I just want to see you know, if you remind us, where do your covenants sit on the leverage metrics for the next few quarters?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nIt's at 5.5% for the remaining term of the senior secured credit facility.\n\nSunil Sibal -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And you were low-5% at the end of 2019, considering, there maybe some more variability with all that's going on in China and all that. Could you talk a little bit about the levers you may have a level to a kind of scale comfortably within the 5%, 5.5%?\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe say even in stress situations to the downside, that we don't perceive any issues, we are staying comfortably within the 5.5%.\n\nSunil Sibal -- Seaport Global -- Analyst\n\nOkay. That's all I had. Thanks.\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time.\n\nGrant E. Sims -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOkay.

            "content": "Over the last few years, the public perception of technology companies has shifted quite dramatically. Large tech firms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon are no longer the darlings of the world. They are attracting the same kind of ire that financiers attracted a decade ago.\n\nAt the political level, this translates into a broad bipartisan support for regulating the sector, due to the opinion that the most powerful technology companies are monopolies that stifle competition. There are also concerns that they have too much control over the creation and dissemination of news. On both of these counts, regulation will be complicated.\n\nImposing a stricter framework of rules on tech companies is far from straightforward, as the most successful businesses tend to benefit from advantages that come from scale.\n\nAs a social network like Facebook grows in size, it is able to use data to offer better services, which in turn attracts even more customers.\n\nGiven the essential role that scale plays in many tech firms, it is not clear that the kind of antitrust action that we saw in the US more than 100 years ago is relevant to today’s economy.\n\nWe know how to break up a rail company or an oil business into smaller components, but tackling the monopolistic power of a technology company would likely require a different approach, since a simple deconstruction would likely take away many of the elements that make it a successful company in the first place.\n\nIt is also hard to see how the modern conception of pernicious monopolies applies to companies like Facebook and Google. In the 1970s, antitrust regulation was reformulated in terms that focused on consumer welfare: a monopoly was considered pernicious if it negatively impacts the price available to the consumer.\n\nWhen we apply this metric to Amazon for example, we find that its ability to offer low prices is actively a plus to the consumer, despite its dominance of the e-commerce market.\n\nAnd then there are companies that provide services that are nominally free to users, such as Facebook.\n\nEven if you take into account the data that they farm from their users, it is hard to say that the consumer is not getting a good deal. Advertising revenues at Facebook are 43 cents a day per user, which results in a profit of nine cents in the US and three cents in Europe. Does a user get three cents worth of utility from the platform?\n\nResearch from 2012 also suggested that free digital services increase the consumer surplus in the US alone by over $100bn per year, which is equivalent to $300 per capita. So it appears that the new interpretation of monopolistic also does not fit technology.\n\nMoving onto the issue of fake news being spread on tech platforms, we find an equally complicated situation.\n\nOne of the main complaints here is that social media algorithms ensure that people only see news they agree with. This not only leads to a polarisation in political attitudes, but it also allows voters to be influenced by factually inaccurate reports.\n\nIt is not clear how breaking up the companies could help with this — if for example, Instagram were separated from Facebook. But there is an argument that larger companies have the resources to invest in the workforce and the artificial intelligence needed to combat the spread of fake news.\n\nSmaller companies would be unable to keep up. For shareholders in the larger tech companies, we can read this as a situation where there is short-term pain for long-term gain, in the form of barriers to entry in the future.\n\nIt should be clear by now that no matter how governments approach the regulation of large tech firms, the path ahead will not be a straight one.\n\nIt seems likely that countries will coordinate on a supranational level to reform tax systems for the globalised twenty-first century. Examples of solutions include the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base that would allocate the taxable profits of a multinational corporation by a formula.\n\nThis has the benefit of allowing individual nations to decide what rate to tax their share of the tax base. The reason that this reform has taken so long is that it is difficult for countries to agree on a common formula. We think the idea has enough political momentum to happen in the medium term.\n\nTo summarise, current regulation in the US is not fit for purpose with today’s digital economy. Certain aspects of internet companies make competition in their respective markets unlikely, and politicians are likely to view increased regulation, rather than direct public provision, as the solution.\n\nRegulation is likely to segment these global businesses, as regional regulators focus on their preferred measures.\n\nThe complexity of many of these issues means that investigations will take many years, in which time the companies may have changed, perhaps in anticipation of the regulator’s judgements. Acquisitions will increasingly come under scrutiny and are more likely to be blocked.\n\nGiven the difficulty in regulating these businesses, perhaps the easiest route for governments to follow is to increase the tax burden on them. Traditionally, tax has been one of the most effective ways of mitigating the market failure caused by monopolies.\n\nBut big tech firms tend to provide customers with a desirable service at a negligible cost, which makes them harder to tax. It seems likely that international coordination will be needed in order to increase the tax burden of big tech in the next few years.\n\nSign up to City A.M.’s Midday Update newsletter, delivered to your inbox every lunchtime\n\nMain image credit: Getty"

            "content": "Right now, it seems that this \"positive\" scenario for the United States will last for the full year of 2020.\n\nForeign risk-averse monies continue to flow into the United States as economic uncertainty, coupled with new news about the coronavirus from China, captures attention.\n\nWednesday morning, the dollar strengthened in foreign exchange markets as it took only $1.0790 to buy one euro.\n\nThe value of the US dollar rose again, and this time, the dollar cost of a euro dropped below $1.08. This is the first time since the middle of April 2017 that the price has fallen this low.\n\nThe US dollar index (DXY) has risen to just under 99.50, and again, one has to go back to the middle of April 2017 for the index to be so low.\n\nAs I wrote last week, the major driving force seems to be the risk-averse monies coming from around the world coming to the United States.\n\nAnd, there seems to be a reason for risk-averse monies to be nervous about a lot of things happening in the world. For example, the news coming out of Germany and out of Europe has seemingly gotten worse.\n\nChina's coronavirus situation seems to be getting worse as even Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is saying its earnings will be impacted.\n\nFurthermore, the US economy seems to be doing well, especially when compared with the performance of other major areas of the world, and the Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve continue to hold on to the trust of the financial community in terms of continuing to support current growth rates.\n\nAll this together also continues to support the US stock market.\n\nStock prices in the United States seem to be coming back today after dropping on Apple's concerns, which came out yesterday.\n\nEven with Apple's news, the NASDAQ index recovered and moved to a new daily high.\n\nThere are just two points that I would like to make on this movement in the value of the dollar.\n\nFirst, I believe that the strength of the US dollar gives us a clue about the \"general\" state of mind in global financial markets.\n\nFor whatever is going on in the United States, its economics and its politics, the managers of money in the world appear to believe that the best place to place their funds is in the United States and not elsewhere.\n\nAnd, given the political situation in the rest of the world, it appears as if these money managers believe that, although things are not in very good shape right now, they don't see the situation improving much, if at all, in the near future.\n\nFor example, given the strong role that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has played in the world over the years she has led Germany, it is hard to see the effort by some to get Ms. Merkel to resign her post early.\n\nReal leadership in the world seems to be particularly sparse these days.\n\nThe second part of this reflection considers how this picture plays within the United States itself.\n\nThe United States economy is going to do OK in 2020. Although the numbers on GDP growth may not be too strong, coming in around 2.0 percent to 2.2 percent, the actual economy, as I have been writing, may actually be stronger than these numbers indicate.\n\nFurthermore, with the Federal Reserve continuing to underwrite the expansion, as it has done for ten years, and with international financial markets supporting the US dollar with monetary flows, the economy should do all right.\n\nIt is going to be difficult for politicians to \"talk down\" the economy in this presidential election year.\n\nAs far as the dollar is concerned, it may be the case that breaking the $1.08 floor, the new range for the dollar/euro exchange rate may need to be dropped. Maybe the new range should be $1.0700 to $1.0900 from $1.080 to $1.1000. I am going to have to give this some more study.\n\nThe U. S. Dollar Index should rise at least to 100.00.\n\nThe important thing for now is that the US dollar has gotten stronger and will remain around this level for the foreseeable future. This should help to provide a positive appraisal for the United States economy in this election year.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

            "content": "The RBA may be getting ready behind the scenes to cut rates soon. (Salvatore Laporta, Getty Images)\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may be considering cutting the official interest rate from 0.75% after unemployment rose quicker than expected.\n\nWhile creating 13,500 more net jobs in January, the unemployment rate jumped from 5.1% to 5.3%.\n\nThe market appears to be pricing in an April cut as a result, although there is a chance the RBA could cut at its next rates meeting in March.\n\nVisit Business Insider Australia’s homepage for more stories.\n\nPhillip Lowe is not going to be happy about this one.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor would be tearing his hair out today down at Martin Place with Australia’s unemployment rate shooting up to 5.3% in January, according to new seasonally adjusted data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\nLowe’s been playing a game of cat and mouse with the Australian labour market, naming the taming of it a top priority for the central bank. In an ideal world, he’d be starting at a number below 4.5% – in order to get our wages seriously growing and get us shopping – but we don’t live in that world, and the economy doesn’t look like it’s going to grant that wish anytime soon.\n\nInstead, unemployment has jumped from 5.1% in December despite the economy producing more work, not less. In the month of January, part-time workers said goodbye to 32,700 jobs but there were 46,200 more full-time jobs to go around – a net increase of 13,500.\n\nRegardless, unemployment is still on the rise, largely because of an increase in the participation rate – the percentage of the population over 15 who are either in work or looking for it. That nudged upwards from 66% to 66.1%. For perspective, Australia thought it’d hit peak participation rate in March 2018, at 65.7%, but what did it know? In other words, more people than ever want a job in this country and we just can’t create them quickly enough.\n\nOverall it paints a “messy” picture, AMP Capital senior economist Diana Mousina, with the RBA expecting it to rise at 5.2%\n\n“The unexpected increase in the unemployment rate sits against the better composition of jobs growth – a big lift in full-time jobs growth,” she said in a note issued to Business Insider Australia.\n\n“Our jobs leading indicator suggests that employment growth will remain below 2% per annum which will keep the unemployment rate elevated around 5.3% or slightly above.”\n\nBut there’s another all-important number to consider, the underutilisation rate – which includes the unemployment rate as well as the number of people who have work but not enough – reached 13.9% on a seasonally adjusted basis. Unfortunately, that’s the highest it has been since April 2018 and appears to be rising.\n\n“The underutilisation rate has a strong relationship with wage growth and the increase suggests that wage growth could soften from its already low levels,” Indeed Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering said.”Overall the quality of job creation appears to have declined. Hours worked rose by just 1.3% over the past year, compared with a 2.0% increase in employment. Consequently, the average worker is working fewer hours each week. Hours worked has tended to lead changes in employment growth, suggesting that employment growth may soften in the coming months.”\n\nThis sluggish labour data, with potentially more to come, falls after repeated signals from the Reserve Bank of Australia that it could continue to cut rates from 0.75% in order to keep unemployment in check.\n\nWhile negative, the result shouldn’t snap the Lowe and his board into action just yet, according to Commonwealth Bank senior economist Gareth Aird who revealed he expects the RBA to wait a little longer before slashing interest rates.\n\n“We retain our view that April looks the most likely month for the next 0.25% rate cut. March is clearly ‘live’, but we suspect the RBA will want to see the February employment report before delivering on its easing bias,” Aird said.\n\nLooking ahead, there could be worse yet to come in the way of – to quote former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld – two ‘known unknowns’.\n\n“The ABS also noted there was little impact from the bushfires on employment thus far – we didn’t expect it to really emerge yet, but bushfires and now coronavirus remain a risk for employment in the months ahead, particularly via the highly casualised tourism industry,” Capital Markets macro rates strategists Robert Thompson said, noting he remains more optimistic as to the full impact of both.\n\n“We continue to look for further easing from the RBA in June this year, but with the risk that this slips into the second half of 2020 as the Bank looks through a likely weak raft of first-quarter data on the grounds that current noise from bushfires [and the] coronavirus will reverse and should be looked through.”\n\nLowe would bloody hope so.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

Welcome to the Sunstone Hotel Investors Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded today, February 19th, 2020 at 12:00 PM Eastern Time.\n\nI'll now turn the presentation over to Aaron Reyes, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAaron Reyes -- Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have all received a copy of our fourth quarter earnings release and supplemental, which were made available yesterday. Who do not yet have a copy, you can access them on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in our prospectuses 10-Qs, 10-Ks and other filings with the SEC, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. We caution you to consider these factors in evaluating our forward-looking statements.\n\nWe also note that this call may contain non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted FFO and hotel adjusted EBITDA margins. We are providing that information as a supplement to information prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nWith us on the call today are John Arabia, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bryan Giglia, Chief Financial Officer. After our remarks, we will be available to answer your questions.\n\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to John. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. Aaron. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining us today. We'll begin today's call with a review of the successful 2019, including the better-than-expected fourth quarter and full-year operating results and earnings, which benefited from continued investments in our portfolio. Next, I'll provide our thoughts on the 2020 operating environment and discuss our approach to capital allocation. Afterwards, Bryan will provide an update on our fortress balance sheet and review the specifics of our initial 2020 guidance.\n\nLet's begin with a recap of last year. In 2019, we continued to see the long-term benefits from the investments made within our portfolio over the last few years. Some of these investments, including the renovation of Boston Park Plaza and Hyatt San Francisco resulted in meaningful RevPAR index gains and profitability increases over the last few years, yet, we believe that these properties in general have reached stabilization.\n\nHowever, we expect to continue to benefit from other investments including from the continued RevPAR index gains in Wailea, as the hotel continues to benefit from a multi-year ramp up, from the new ballroom at the Renaissance Orlando, which is attracting higher quality and larger groups, from the 17 keys added at the Hyatt San Francisco late last year and from the rooms renovations completed at these Hilton San Diego Bayfront earlier in the year.\n\nRenaissance Orlando is a great example of making strategic long-term investments translates into value creation and future earnings growth. In January 2019, just over a year ago, we opened a new 46,000 square foot state-of-the-art meeting space, which has not only generated great customer feedback, but has also helped the hotel produce the highest number of group room nights booked at the hotel in a single year.\n\nMoving on to smaller yet equally important projects, we invested over $9 million into a variety of environmental projects during 2019, including, retrofitting additional lighting systems, installing low-flow plumbing fixture and bulk amenity dispensers, as well as upgrading several building systems in order to reduce overall energy consumption. These important projects not only reduce the environmental impact on our portfolio, but in several cases also result in attractive economic returns. We will continue to make these important ESG investments as we focus on ways to use more renewable energy, reduce our usage of single use items such as plastic containers, straws and trash bags and to increasingly incorporate more reclaimed and recycled materials into our renovations.\n\nIn addition to capital investments, we continue our ongoing initiatives to recycle capital and to concentrate our portfolio into long-term relevant real estate. Late last year, we disposed of the leasehold interest in the Courtyard, LAX for $50 million. The sales price equates to an estimated 5.8% cap rate on our full year 2019 forecasted NOI, which is roughly 200 basis points lower than the implied cap rate on the remaining portfolio as calculated by our recent share price and our 2020 guidance.\n\nThat is, we sold one of the lowest quality hotels and one subject to a ground lease at a price, well in excess that implied by our current share valuation. This sale further consolidates our portfolio into Long-Term Relevant Real Estate and reduces our ground lease exposure. While RevPAR comparisons don't always tell the full picture, it's worthwhile to note that the hotel's 2019 RevPAR and EBITDA per key was approximately 21% lower and 37% lower, respectively, than was the case for the remainder of our portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, the sale of one of our last ground lease assets reduced our total actual hotel EBITDA subject to ground or air rates to approximately 15% down from over 50% several years ago. With only three leased hotels remaining in the portfolio, we are very pleased with our success in reducing our leasehold exposure to one of the lowest levels among the hotel REITs.\n\nNow, let's talk a little bit about recent operating results. Despite a challenging operating backdrop, we were pleased that our results came in are the high end or -- high end up or exceeded our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year. Fourth quarter comparable portfolio RevPAR increased 80 basis points over the prior year and comparable portfolio total revenues increased 2.1% bringing our full year RevPAR and total revenue growth to 1.9% and 2.9%, respectively.\n\nConsistent with our commentary in prior quarters, we continue to seem room revenue growth, driven primarily by transient segments. During 2019, transient room revenue grew approximately 3% while group revenue was roughly flat. Overall, our fourth quarter room revenue exceeded our expectations and contributed to a full year RevPAR growth at the high end of our guidance. In addition to strong performance in the rooms department, total comparable portfolio revenue benefited from a 2.6% increase in food and beverage revenues, a 14% increase in ancillary property level revenues during the quarter.\n\nWhile hotel revenues were stronger than anticipated, hotel profits were negatively impacted by ongoing cost pressures, specifically in wages and benefits, property insurance and property taxes. Nevertheless, comparable hotel level EBITDA exceeded our expectations for the fourth quarter and resulted in full-year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted FFO per diluted share that exceeded the high end of our most recent guidance.\n\nSo, let's talk a bit about some of the positives and negative operating trends from the prior year. Full year 2019 results benefited from continued outsized growth in Wailea and from the contribution of our 2018 capital investments, specifically the renovations at JW New Orleans and Marriott Boston Long Wharf as well as the meeting space additions at Renaissance Orlando that I discussed earlier. In addition, we saw a better-than-expected market growth in Washington, DC, and while the San Francisco market fell short, the very lofty expectations that were in place at the beginning of the year, the city still posted solid RevPAR growth in 2019. Offsetting these areas of strength was general market weakness in Chicago, Portland, La Jolla, and New York City and disruption from the renovation work we hadn't processed at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront and Renaissance Baltimore early in the year.\n\nMore recently, operating trends in the fourth quarter were generally better than anticipated, particularly in December, and we were more -- and they were more encouraging than those witnessed in the third quarter. Several markets exceeded our expectations, including Wailea, Long Beach, Chicago and San Francisco. Transient business in particular, performed better in the fourth quarter with higher than anticipated room rent growth, stronger food and beverage outlets sales and higher ancillary revenues. Offsetting some of the fourth quarter was weakness in Key West, Time Square and San Diego.\n\nWhile our fourth quarter labor productivity improved, we were still negatively impacted by a 2.4% increase in hourly wage rates, higher cost from property insurance and loyalty program expense also constrained profitability and contributed to a 110 basis point reduction in margins and a 1.4% decline in comparable portfolio EBITDA in the fourth quarter, despite a 2.1% increase in comparable portfolio revenues.\n\nNow, let's turn our attention to our outlook for 2020. Our baseline assumption for this year is that the operating environment will be similar to that witnessed in 2019, including tepid RevPAR and total hotel revenue growth. We anticipate that the majority of our markets will experience limited RevPAR growth in 2020. San Francisco is expected to have solid levels of demand in 2020 by historical standards, but the year-over-year comparisons is expected to be challenging given its strong performance in 2019. In addition, we expect headwinds to persist in New York as the market deals with another year of elevated new supply.\n\nThat said, we anticipate healthy growth in Key West, and in those markets with strong citywide calendars, including Boston, Chicago, and Washington DC. In addition, our recently completed renovations at the Renaissance Baltimore and Hilton San Diego Bayfront should result in RevPAR growth in excess of market levels. Finally we expect Wailea Beach Resort to once again be one of our strongest performers in 2020 as the hotel continues to gain share and further surpass our expectations.\n\nWhile RevPAR growth is expected to remain roughly flat, we expect to see a continuation of elevated cost pressures primarily in wages and benefits, property taxes and insurance. Collectively, these three line items make up just over half of our total hotel level operating costs. Additionally, we are engaging a dispute related to the scheduled ground rent increase at the Hilton Times Square that may not be resolved until later in the year. During this dispute and appeal period, we will record the higher rent expense and will receive a refund, if we are successful with our appeal.\n\nFrom a capital perspective, the renovation work -- our renovation work is fairly limited in 2020 and should result in less disruption compared to prior years. Our primary project this year is the full repositioning of the Marriott Portland, which is currently under way and going exceptionally well. The work includes the renovation of all 249 guest rooms, bathrooms, the addition of nine new guest rooms and the complete redesign of all public spaces, meeting areas and food and beverage outlets. The renovation is intended to better position the hotel to compete with many of the independent lifestyle hotels in the Portland market. We expect to incur $2 million of total revenue displacement in the first half of 2020 in connection with this project.\n\nAs we move into 2020, current year group pace for the portfolio is up over 4% and we have 81% of our Groups already on the books, which is the highest crossover level that we've had in the last several years. Our guidance for the first quarter and full year takes into consideration roughly $1 million loss revenue related to already identified group cancellations and attrition in San Francisco, San Diego and Washington DC, attributed to the coronavirus. We expect to mitigate some of this revenue loss through cancellation fees and additional transient bookings, so the net impact is expected to be less than $1 million mentioned.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that our 2020 expectations and earnings guidance do not include any additional impact from the coronavirus which if were to have a negative impact on global economic growth and travel could materially impact our business, our earnings and our outlook for 2020. Simply, too early to accurately assess the impact on our hotels or what it can mean for RevPAR growth, margins and profitability for our portfolio.\n\nSo let's talk a bit about the current investment environment. As we've discussed on prior calls, we continue to struggle with the current pricing expectations on Long-Term Relevant Real Estate. During 2019, we actively underwrote several billion dollars of single assets and portfolio transactions. We've been on several of these potential investments, but in the end, we were not willing to pay the prices needed to compete for an acquisition. Pricing expectations for high quality assets that fit our strategy remain elevated and translated into cap rates after property tax resets below 5% in most cases, and in many cases, cap rates in the mid-3s to mid-4% range.\n\nLooking forward, we continue to expect to underwrite new investments and remain hopeful that we will find the right opportunities will add to our shareholder value over time. At the same time, we expect to dispose of the remaining hotels that do not fit our strategy at reasonable prices. Considering the recent range of our stock price and the resulting implied valuation, we continue to believe that the best use of our excess liquidity will likely be to repurchase our own shares, even if that means shrinking the size of the Company in the short term. Just for this reason, we increased the size of our share repurchase program from $300 million of which we had purchased $54 million to a new authorization of $500 million. As we said before, our repurchase activity will not be programmatic, rather is likely to occur opportunistically and be share price dependent.\n\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan, please go ahead.\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, John and good morning, everyone. We ended 2019 with significant financial liquidity, including more than $680 million of total adjusted unrestricted cash and an undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility. We have approximately $1.2 billion of consolidated debt and preferred securities outstanding and our current in-place debt has a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 4.1 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. Our variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt stands at 23% and 44% of our debt is unsecured.\n\nNow, turning to first quarter and full year 2020 guidance. A full reconciliation can be found in our supplemental and in our earnings release. Our 2020 guidance does not assume any additional share repurchases, nor does it include the impact of any additional asset sales or acquisitions. As John indicated earlier, other than what we have been able to identify to date, our guidance does not include any potential additional impact from the coronavirus, which could have a material impact on travel, hotel demand and profitability. For the full year, we expect total portfolio RevPAR growth to range from down 1.5% to up 1.5%. We expect full year expense growth to increase 3% to 4% driven by a 4% to 6% increase in wages and benefits, which make up 45% of our total cost. This expense growth is expected to result in a same-store margin decline of approximately 150 basis points to 175 basis points.\n\nOur full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges from $280 million to $305 million and our full year adjusted FFO per diluted share ranges from $0.95 to $1.05. Our outlook for 2020 includes approximately $2 million of total revenue displacement and approximately $1 million of EBITDA displacement related to our planned 2020 capital investment projects. In addition, our guidance includes approximately $2.4 million of additional expense related to a disputed ground rent increase at the Hilton Times Square, which is scheduled to increase starting May 2020.\n\nFor the first quarter, we expect total portfolio RevPAR to range from down 0.5% to up 1.5%. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between $54 million and $58 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share to be between $0.16 and $0.18. Finally, this guidance reflects our existing 20 Hotel portfolio and does not assume any additional hotel dispositions, nor does it reflect the incremental future earnings potential that would result from the deployment of our cash.\n\nNow, turning to dividends, our Board of Directors has declared a $0.05 per common share dividend for the first quarter. Consistent with our practice in prior years, we expect to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock throughout 2020, to the extent that the regular quarterly common dividends do not satisfy our annual distribution requirements for 2020, we would expect to pay a catch-up dividend that would generally be equal to our remaining taxable income. Our total cash dividends for 2019 including our fourth quarter catch-up dividend equates to an annual dividend yield of approximately 5.5%. In addition to the common dividend, our Board has also approved the routine quarterly distributions for both outstanding series of preferred securities.\n\nWith that, I'd like to now open the call to questions. Derek, please go ahead.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nLukas Hartwich -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nThanks. Fundamentals continue to be pretty weak. I'm just curious, you kind of commented on hotel values, it sounds like there is still a robust bid out there. But are you seeing any impact to hotel values, given this tough backdrop for fundamentals?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nHi, good morning, Lucas. No, it's bifurcated into a couple of groups for those assets that are really high quality, high-end, iconic Long-Term Relevant Real Estate. There's still an incredibly strong bid for those assets. There is a value add component or something interesting in terms of the ability to bring a new management or if the franchise is subject to change then, I think there is a pretty strong bid for that as well. For more commodity assets, I think the -- it's a little bit more difficult.\n\nLukas Hartwich -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nThat's helpful. And then can you provide -- you touched on this a little bit, the Wailea Beach Resort continues to ramp. In the past you've talked about the rate gap there. Can you remind us what it was prior to the renovation, what you expected and where it is today?\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nGood morning, Lucas, it's Brian. When we acquired the hotel and when we talked about the concept, we're talking about the Wailea luxury set. On a full year basis, the hotel in 2014, was about, $280 behind that set, ending this year, we are $100 -- ending '19 we are at $180 behind that set. So we took the ADR Index from 48% to about 70%.\n\nLukas Hartwich -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nGreat. And then do you have a sense of what the EBITDA per key for those -- that comp set is?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nNo, not on an EBITDA per key basis, we would have RevPAR, but not EBITDA per key.\n\nLukas Hartwich -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nOkay. That's it for me. Thank you.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Lucas.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, we'll next go to Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nSmedes Rose -- Citi -- Analyst\n\nHi, thanks. I wanted to ask you just a little bit more about the Hilton Times Square. You mentioned that some property taxes increases are going to weigh on your full year margin expectations and it seems like that's what may be around $4 million or so of incremental taxes and then you have about $4 million of interest expense there, that I'm just looking at the EBITDA that came in for the year and the fact that the debt, I guess, needs to be refinanced coming into the year. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe talk about some of the issues facing you there and what maybe your longer-term plans are?\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nGood morning, Smedes. The property tax did go up on that hotel. That's not part of the disputed amounts that we are talking about. I think if you look across the board, property tax in a lot of markets is an item where you continue to see pressure especially late in the cycle. And so, when you look at our fixed costs at many markets, Boston, Chicago continues to be a market, Orlando, these are all markets and New York, these are markets where we see significant property tax increases.\n\nFor the Hilton Times Square specifically, what we have under dispute right now is about a $3 million increase to the ground rent expense, that is the lease has a reset that happens in mid-2020 this year, the City of New York is our landlord. They have noticed us that they believe that, that ground value, which is how the rent is calculated has increased. We believe very strongly that it hasn't, given the pressures that, that market has been under. We are going through the arbitration process now, which will take time, but unfortunately part of the lease, we are forced to pay the higher amount during that arbitration period. And then once if we are -- if we prevail, we would get a refund but we will have to absorb that amount, which I think is about 30 basis points on margins until we have a final decision.\n\nWhen you look on a pro forma basis, those increases to the Hilton's costs including the loan, the interest expense, it -- the EBITDA being produced by that hotel is minimal, if any, and so we will, the maturity isn't until later this year, we will assess any options we have at that time and come up with what was the best course is for us.\n\nSmedes Rose -- Citi -- Analyst\n\nOkay, thanks. And then, John, I just wanted to ask you, I mean, you said that the buybacks will be opportunistic versus programmatic, but you also made your commentary that suggests you think the stock is significantly below with the underlying asset value. So I'm just wondering why wouldn't you have a more kind of programmatic or aggressive repurchase program in place at these levels?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nSmedes, we're really not going to comment on how we're going to approach the share repurchase, but clearly, it's something we're highly focused on and something that we think represents our best incremental investment, at least relative to any potential acquisitions.\n\nSmedes Rose -- Citi -- Analyst\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, we'll next go to Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Powell -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nHello, guys. John, you mentioned that you saw better transient trends in December. Could you describe if that was business or leisure transient? And how those trends persisted or have they persisted into January and February here so far?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, we actually saw a pretty good demand in both transient corporate and transient leisure in our portfolio. In December, it was fairly broad-based, while Wailea just hit an absolute home run in the fourth quarter. What we saw is compared to what we saw in a couple of the quarters earlier than that in 2019 was a good portion of our hotels actually saw an uplift in what had been expectations that had been or advised down during the year. So overall, we were fairly pleased.\n\nWhat we've seen recently, let's say, over the last six weeks is, we've actually seen a little bit of an uptick in our transient bookings. We already have a good amount of group business on the books for March. But when we take a look at the first quarter, we've been pleasantly surprised that after a few months of transient weakness, in terms of short-term bookings that we had mentioned on our last call, the past six weeks have actually been pretty good.\n\nAnthony Powell -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nGot it. So with an uptick in transient bookings and in group pace of up 4%, how does that fit with the RevPAR guidance of negative 1.5% to plus 1.5%?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThat was just one of the many inputs when we look through each one of our hotels, it's one of the inputs. So don't know what, I can add to that.\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Anthony, if you look on the -- kind of our view on the quarterly basis, the weakest quarter would be is expected to be fourth quarter this year, certain markets, especially with the election, DC is expected to be softer and during that -- and during November a pull back in business transient around the election is expected. And so that's in our budgets and in our forecasts, which if that proves to be otherwise, then maybe you get a little bit more pickup in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnthony Powell -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Understood. And just broadly, have you had -- have you started to talk with the brands about how to address this profitability issue that maybe owners are facing across the country? It seems like with RevPAR of 1% and cost of 4%, that's not going to really work for either the owners or the brand in terms of getting incentive fee growth. Had there been talks about brand standard fee, brand standard changes or other ways to improve profitability at the hotel level?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nIt's a constant communication between our operating partners and ourselves. But the simple fact of the matter is look, if the cost of labor is going up and there are -- it's become more difficult to find folks to work at the hotels, obviously, those, that is a cost pressure that it's just difficult to deal with. I think it's premature and I might be in the minority on this, but I think it is premature to start saying that we would have significant cutbacks in terms of overall service levels, particularly with the quality of the portfolio we have. I just think that that's a wrong long-term decision to make. Obviously, if we saw a material decline in terms of occupancy and rates, everything is on the table, but I think that's probably premature at this point to move into in a material way.\n\nAnthony Powell -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nRight. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll next go to Bill Crow with Raymond James.\n\nBill Crow -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. Thanks guys. As you look out in the next three or four months, is there anything out there in the citywide schedule in markets like San Francisco, San Diego, DC, you highlighted earlier that, that because of their -- because of the nature of the events may have more sensitivity to the coronavirus inbound international travel that are at risk here that are going to make the headlines that we have to worry about?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, there is always some level of concern with a great unknown like this Bill. And when we take a look at those markets that have the largest amount of inbound Chinese travel, those being San Francisco, LA, New York, we've -- we are talking with our operators trying to assess risk. And I think the potential risk of show up in a couple of different ways. On a direct path, could we see a decline in Chinese travel? Sure, that for us represents about 50 basis points of our total revenues. So it's a very, very small number. When you take a look at the groups, I think you'd see it manifest itself as we have seen it already in terms of potential group cancellations, which we've seen a couple of small ones or delegations from China etc. -- China-Asia, etc., not coming. So that will either force a cancellation or more likely a higher level of attrition on certain groups.\n\nSo what we have been doing over the past week or two is working with all of our hotels and our operating partners to make sure that we are doing as good a job as we can in a very, very cloudy environment, so to speak, to make sure that we're managing our attrition to those groups and our scrub, so to speak well enough to make sure that we're opening up transient channels just to make sure we can maximize the occupancy that we can. So it is a very, very fluid situation. Thus far, I would say that the impact is pretty modest, but given what we've seen in other parts of the world, there is obviously more concerning scenarios that one could paint, although we don't see any evidence of that now.\n\nBill Crow -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nOkay. I always like to talk big picture with you, John. I appreciate your thoughts. If we're convinced that RevPAR growth was going to be in this kind of plus or minus 1% range, for say the next three or four or five years, what would you do differently?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nLet's see, RevPAR growth, right? So let's take that scenario, which I do not believe to be the case. Let me just put that upfront, but it's a scenario your hypothetical, your painting, so if RevPAR growth was let's say 0% to 1% from those portfolios over a prolonged period of time, my gut tells me that expense growth will continue to outpace that, that the world, that the economy will stay in this type of picture, that asset values will remain a bit elevated, it will be an awful environment in which would be a capital allocator. If that happens, I think what you'll see is a drain on earnings and a difficult environment in which to capital allocate, that'd be a tough go, Bill.\n\nBill Crow -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nYes. And then one final one from me, you talked about potentially shrinking the Company, which I understand, but at what point does the dividend come into consideration? I don't mean the nickel a quarter, I just mean that the total and maybe some reluctance to see a big change in the fourth quarter dividend?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, one of the things I love about our dividend strategy as we pay out a 100% of our taxable income or roughly a 100% of our taxable income, obviously our nickels per quarter, the routine dividend is very safe as one would expect, particularly with our fortress balance sheet. We have paid out over the past couple of years a lot of gains on sale, which has positively impacted our dividends. So I would have to take that into consideration, but our expectation would be that we will just continue on that path of paying out 100% of taxable income and we think that, that works with us.\n\nBill Crow -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nAlright. Thanks, John.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Bill.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll next go to Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Scholes -- SunTrust -- Analyst\n\nHi, good afternoon.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nHey, Patrick.\n\nPatrick Scholes -- SunTrust -- Analyst\n\nHey. John question for you. Yesterday, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal discussing rising foreclosures and defaults In the New York City hotel market. When does Sunstone step in to take advantage of something like that? How are you thinking about the timing on that type of scenario? Thank you.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe clearly have the ability as Brian just mentioned, we have our own hotel to work through currently. We will be happy looking at distressed situations and potentially taking advantage of those, but the timing on New York, I think we're probably a little early there.\n\nPatrick Scholes -- SunTrust -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Okay, that's it. Thanks, John.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll next go to Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.\n\nChris Woronka -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning guys. Wanted to ask on your full year guidance, how much of a maybe uplift in non-room revenues? How do you underwrite that kind of stuff and is there another pretty good uplift embedded in guidance for the year or do you assume something pretty modest?\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nGood morning, Chris. Our expectation right now is that non-room revenue will increase between 2% and 4% this year, some of that's driven by some fees that went into place last year that are not fully -- that haven't fully anniversaried yet and so, while on the food and beverage side, we definitely see that moderating and on the banquet food and beverage side, we see that moderating from where we've had the last couple of years, but we have some of these other fees that are still ramping up.\n\nChris Woronka -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then on the share repurchase, I think you mentioned in the release, was done at $12.66 which was a really good timing on your part, did you stop that because of a -- was it an earnings blackout period that came into effect or is it just -- you just decided to stop at a certain level?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThat was done in conjunction with our 10b5-1 program. And so that we had set our parameters, before we went into a blackout period. And so that was done automatically, so to speak. And we hit a pre-described level and amount. So that window typically opens back up to where we have more direct control on that, opens up a couple of days after our earnings.\n\nChris Woronka -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nOkay, great. And just on Wailea, to go back to the, you gave out the ADR Index. If you get to where you want to get to, which is I guess is a 100% or better of the market, is that -- should we assume that that's going to pretty much flow straight through to the bottom line or is there any kind of step function in terms of incentive fees or other expenses that would come into play there?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. Well, one can always dream, I really do not think that, that hotel will ever get to 100% of index in what is an incredible comp set, including the Four Seasons and what our friends over at Houston and at the Andaz and the Fairmont. So financial success to us was closing that gap a bit and we have massively outperformed that. So I think there is a little bit of a more RevPAR index gain that Bryan had mentioned, but we will not get to that point. At one point, this hotel versus the kind of Polycom set was probably in the 80%, 80 plus percent index and we've gotten the hotel up to about 120% indexed versus that comp set, which we think is reasonable considering our location and the amenities that we now provide.\n\nChris Woronka -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nOkay, very good. Thanks guys.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nRich Hightower -- Evercore -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning guys.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nHey, Rich.\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nHey, Rich.\n\nRich Hightower -- Evercore -- Analyst\n\nJohn and Brian, I'm asking that's only because the 10-K just hit as I was thinking of a question to ask, but can you walk us through the impairment charge at the Renaissance Harborplace and square that against the renovation expense plan for this year, really quickly?\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nGood morning, Rich. The renovation at Harborplace was completed last year and that was a cyclical rooms renovation, that was -- that had been scheduled for some time. When it comes to impairments, it's -- GAAP requires us on a quarterly basis to look for indicators in impairment, which could be declining, there could be market conditions, there could be declining occupancy rates or something specific to the hotel and on a normal basis, we will have a handful of hotels that might have an indicator of impairment from time to time.\n\nThe next step after you've identified those with and indicators of impairment as you look at the undiscounted cash flow of the hotel, your expectation of that over what your whole period is. And typically, since we're an infant-like [Phonetic] vehicle, we look at a 10-year hold and you look at the undiscounted cash flows through that time period. And then the terminal value of the hotel after that, which usually doesn't lead to any sort of impairment unless the hotel has been -- has had significant declines. What we did and what led to $24 million impairment on this hotel is, if this hotel is not deemed to be a Long-Term Relevant Hotel, we do now shorten the whole period for that Hotel, which resulted in a lower cash flow, total cash flow than what our book value was, and that led to the impairment.\n\nRich Hightower -- Evercore -- Analyst\n\nOkay. So in the impairment charges against the improved asset value and post renovation specifically?\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nCorrect. It's compared to the net book value, which would be the gross value less depreciation.\n\nRich Hightower -- Evercore -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Okay, that's fine. My other question, just on the topic of expenses again. Can you guys translate the margin decline guidance into sort of same-store expense growth expected for 2020? And then maybe break that down across the major categories that you mentioned, labor, property taxes, etc., just so we can look at it that way as well?\n\nBryan A. Giglia -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n\nYes. So if you look at -- and I think what we said in the prepared remarks, was that the expectation of total expenses was going to increase, call it 3% to 4%, that if you look at the different pieces of that, so let's take labor, salaries and wages first. That's going to be roughly 45% of our total costs. If those are increasing 4% to 6% and then everything else from the hotel side of things are much less closer to inflationary growth, even some items that group commissions might be down a little bit.\n\nThe other expenses though that -- and really it's the fixed expenses, those are seeing larger increases this year, real estate and property tax continues to be significant growth major markets, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, all had major increases to all property owners this year. Ground rent at Hilton Times Square, while it's under appeal is also negatively impacting that. And then, insurance, as you recall, the property insurance rates went up significantly last year, our policy starts in July, so that has so a half year of impact. So, the other half of the expenses are great -- or 55% of the expenses are say increasing 3% to 4%, or maybe 2.5% to 3.5%, that's going to give you a combined increase of 3% to 4% where -- for a total of hotel expenses.\n\nRich Hightower -- Evercore -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Okay, thanks for the color there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll next go to David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nHi, good afternoon, everyone, or good morning. I wanted to go back to the share repurchase aspect of it. And without getting to specifics about execution, I wanted to just revisit the philosophy behind it. Should we take some meaning and the expectation that you just have more capital than you can have a sort of viable use for otherwise, and this is sort of the default avenue or is this something that could be an ongoing aspect of the capital structure or capital utilization going forward?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, I think it's really more of the latter David, hat share repurchase is a capital allocation tool made available to public companies that can arbitrage between public and private both ways. So I think it's -- we have always said, it's not a signaling tool. We don't use it to signal the market, our shares are cheap. We use it as a capital allocation tool and as we continue to look out in the environment and see asking prices that are difficult to justify, we do know that while not every single one of our hotels within our portfolio is long term relevant real estate, when you take a look at the bulk of our value anchored by properties like Wailea, like Embarcadero like Long Wharf, keep going. Most of our value is in those hotels and an easy way for us to buy more long-term relevant real estate is simply to buy back our own stock.\n\nWe know the assets incredibly well, really no trends -- transaction cost, any materiality to be discussed. There is no transfer taxes etc., etc., etc. And there is some amount of scale that we can execute that investment on behalf of our existing shareholders. So I don't think it is something that's on the table all the time because I'm hopeful that at some point, we get back to a point of trading at a premium to NAV and can grow this company in a beneficial way. But to the extent that we have to play the cards that were dealt to us now and in trading at a discount to NAV. Now when I take a look at one of our clear advantages and that is our balance sheet, we have the ability to execute on that. So we've been as forthright, I think as possible in saying that, that remains our most attractive investment alternative.\n\nDavid Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nPerfect. And if I can just one quick follow-up, I know that we are always trying to measure the stack on your collective desks of deal opportunities that you think are viable. My question is, is this stack getting short progressively shorter or is it choppy? How would you characterize that stack of viable opportunities to consider?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nCouple of things that we're working on right now. Couple of things that we bid on in the last kind of month or two. We have our fingers on a couple of things that we think might eventually come to market that we're hopeful will or that we're trying to do direct with somebody. So it's sporadic. But you know, there has been some volume and when I mean volume, we're talking -- we tend to go after fairly chunky assets. I mean, assets that are -- it's probably pretty rare that we look at an asset, it's $30 million, $40 million, $50 million, not to say it couldn't be done, but a lot of the assets we look at are $200 million, $300 million, $600 million. So it's chunky.\n\nDavid Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nChunky. Perfect, thank you very much.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nChunky, probably not a good financial term, but I'll use it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll next go to Amanda Sweitzer with Baird.\n\nAmanda Sweitzer -- Baird -- Analyst\n\nThanks, good morning guys.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning.\n\nAmanda Sweitzer -- Baird -- Analyst\n\nI was hoping you could address just your lower projected capex spending. I mean, your 2019 spending came in meaningfully below your initial guidance and then 2020 is also lower than what we were expecting as well. Are you kind of systematically reducing capex spending due to where you see fundamentals or is there something else that's driving that trend?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nOne -- one reason that the number went down because we saw the Courtyard -- Courtyard LAX, which was slated for a pretty significant renovation. And the other, we decided to postpone the renovation on the rooms for the Embassy Suites Chicago, that will eventually be done, but we just pushed it out a bit. And then just the way that the calendar rolls with how the overall portfolio, the overall portfolio is in really good shape. There'll be some couple other renovations that happen in '21, '22, '23 but that's normal course of business. I wouldn't say that there is anything specific in terms of delaying renovations. We believe strongly that, that delaying renovations, just to try and save capital is a bad business decision. It has to start off with, what is the hotel need, help the hotel best position itself and clearly, our balance sheet allows us to make those investments when we think it's the right time.\n\nAmanda Sweitzer -- Baird -- Analyst\n\nThat's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks guys.\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGreat. Thanks, Amanda.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And we do have a follow-up question from Bill Crow with Raymond James.\n\nBill Crow -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thanks. John, just a couple of the points here. The strength in December, some of that's been attributed to the change in the calendars is that -- is there anything to that or was this real legitimate strength that you saw?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, I mean well, hopefully, we saw the changes in the calendar happening and while sometimes that throws us for a little bit of loop, I think we had that covered. It just happened to be stronger booking short term in overall transient business. And again, including places like Wailea. So overall, it was a little bit more broad based. But when I say that, let's keep in mind that this is, this is one month and I wouldn't necessarily say one month sets a new trend or a new direction in trend, just like the couple of months before that, that we were a little bit weaker than anticipated. I wouldn't say that that was the case either.\n\nBill Crow -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nAnd then same sort of question, but you -- both you and Hilton pointed to an uptick in demand over the last few weeks in transient demand looking forward. Again it is that seasonal, is it above and beyond what you would see in a seasonal recovery? Can you categorize it at all?\n\nJohn V. Arabia -- President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. It's adjusted for seasonality. So we're just taking a look at the total number of overall transient reservations made and on a rolling -- on an individual week basis, but then on a rolling six-week basis. And we've seen a little bit of an uptick. I think a couple of quarters ago, I had mentioned that we saw a little bit of weakness that we were continuing to monitor and just recently, despite all the concerns in the world about various things, the past six weeks have actually been pretty good.\n\nBill Crow -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nAlright.

            "content": "Authored by James Rickards via The Daily Reckoning,\n\nOne event is taking center stage in the world that affects not only basic survival for millions of people, but the health of the global economy overall.\n\nOf course, I’m talking about the coronavirus outbreak currently playing out before our eyes in China.\n\nChina’s economy was slowing substantially before the outbreak of the highly contagious and deadly virus last fall.\n\nThis slowing was the predictable result of excessive debt levels, Trump’s retaliation in the trade wars, and China’s encounter with what development economists call the “middle-income trap.”\n\nDeveloping economies can grow at double-digit rates as they move from low-income (about $3,000 annual per capita income) to middle-income (about $10,000 annual per capita income).\n\nThe main requirements are limits on corruption, a large pool of available labor, and an attractive legal environment for foreign direct investment. Once investment is used for infrastructure and labor is mobilized, large-scale basic manufacturing can commence.\n\nThis powers growth and the accumulation of hard currency reserves from export earnings.\n\nThe difficulty begins when an economy tries to move from middle-income to high-income (about $18,000 annual per capita income). That move requires more than cheap labor and infrastructure investment. It requires applied technology to produce high-value added products.\n\nOnly Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore have made this transition, (excluding Japan after World War II, and oil-exporting nations).\n\nThis explains why China has been so focused on stealing U.S. intellectual property.\n\nTrump has been closing that avenue. China cannot generate the needed technology through its own R&D. China is stuck in the middle-income trap and a slowdown in growth is the inevitable result.\n\nThe story gets worse for China.\n\nAs of Friday, the total reported number of people infected by the coronavirus was 64,435. And the death toll was up to 1,383, including three people outside of China.\n\nThose figures are official statistics released by China and other countries around the world where the virus has spread.\n\nHowever, there is substantial medical, anecdotal, and model-based evidence that the actual infection rate and death rate may be ten to twenty times higher than those official statistics.\n\nOver 60 million Chinese in several major cities are under “lock-down” where individuals are confined to their homes and may only leave once every three days to buy groceries.\n\nStreets are empty, stores are closed, trains and planes are not moving, and factories are shut. The Chinese economy is slowly grinding to a halt.\n\nThis not only affects China’s economy as a whole, but the contagion filters down into individual companies that are dependent on China both for supply chain inputs and final sales.\n\nAnd it will have a rippling effect on the U.S. economy also. This story has a long way to run."

Picture taken February 17, 2020. cnsphoto via REUTERS\n\nThe Chinese manufacturing engine that powers much of the world economy is struggling to restart after an extended Lunar New Year break, hindered by travel and quarantine restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus epidemic and still in place in many parts of the country.\n\nCase in point: in the southern China manufacturing hub of Dongguan, a factory that makes vaporizers and other products had just half of its workforce of 40 last week and was struggling to function without key personnel.\n\n“The quality inspectors, they’re all out,” said Renaud Anjoran, who runs the factory. “One is stuck in Hubei, the other is in an area with no transportation open.”\n\nAnjoran said other Dongguan manufacturers were also scrambling with half their normal staff levels, with some having even less than that.\n\nThe problems are exacerbating pain inflicted by loss of business from the U.S.-China trade war and present huge logistical challenges as companies, many dependent on migrant workers, grapple with a myriad of restrictions that differ by province, city and local district.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday rescinded a quarterly sales target made just weeks ago, saying the ramp up of factories in China was slower than anticipated. Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) have had to suspend some production - not just in China but also at home - for lack of parts.\n\nSome smaller firms, particularly in Southeast Asia and reliant on supplies from China, are having to make tough decisions.\n\nTaiwan’s Sica New Materials abruptly shut its factory in Thailand at the end of January, laying off about 350 workers.\n\n“They couldn’t produce because raw materials weren’t being sent from China,” said Pairote Panthakarn from the government’s welfare and labour protection office in Kanchanaburi province, where the factory is located. Sica New Materials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSinoproud Cambodia Garments Co Ltd, whose customers include fashion retailer Zara’s parent Inditex (ITX.MC), told Reuters it may scale back production as stocks of fabric were getting low.\n\n“We hope we get the product in March and if we don’t get the product in March, we might just have to cut back and put the workers on half pay,” said general manager Tu Ailan.\n\nNearly half of 109 U.S. companies responding to a poll by Shanghai’s American Chamber of Commerce said plant shutdowns have already had an impact on their supply chains, while almost all of the remainder expect an impact within the next month. [nL4N2AH1W6]\n\nThe outbreak, slow pace of business resumption and its impact on the global economy is set to dominate discussions at this weekend’s G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Riyadh, though Chinese counterparts will not attend as they focus on efforts to limit the fallout.\n\nThe coronavirus, described by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva as a global health emergency and “our most pressing uncertainty” is set to knock 0.5 percentage points off global growth in the first quarter for a growth rate of 2.5%, Morgan Stanley economists estimate. They predict China’s GDP will expand just 4.2% in the quarter from a year earlier, down from 6% in last quarter.\n\nFREIGHT ACHES\n\nEven if factories have enough workers, the transportation of supplies and finished goods has also been a major headache.\n\n“The resumption of motor transport is very slow and curbs production,” said an executive at a steel mill in the eastern province of Shandong, citing insufficient drivers and a plethora of checkpoints slowing down traffic.\n\n“The situation is easing now, but total recovery might need to wait till the end of the month,” said the executive who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to identified.\n\nThe shortage of workers at Chinese ports has resulted in fewer calls from container shipping lines, a situation likely to result in months of delivery delays, while some air cargo firms such as Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) have reduced services in response to crew health concerns and uncertain demand. [nL8N2A71CU]\n\nFedEx Corp (FDX.N) told Reuters it was starting to see a slow pick-up in demand and that it was in discussions with many local governments as there were different restrictions in different cities.\n\nThe magnitude of the challenges presented by the new coronavirus crisis is much greater than SARS in the early 2000s, said Karen Reddington, president of FedEx Express Asia Pacific.\n\n“China is so much more connected, the fact that China now represents so much of the world’s economy I think that’s why, it seems so much more impactful at this time,” she said.\n\nMathieu Montelon, general manager of France’s Bigben Interactive, which makes smartphone accessories in the southeast province of Guangdong, said the disruptions underscored the complexity of inter-connected supply chains.\n\n“Even when the factory is in a position to open and take orders, their subcontractors might have issue with other local authorities, so they cannot open, or they don’t have the workers,” he said.\n\nHe added that Bigben is switching up the mix of products it offers retailers, pushing goods made in other countries less affected by the virus.\n\nOthers are looking at more drastic action, accelerating a broader shift of production out of China that took off with the trade war.\n\nAnjoran, the operator of the factory in Dongguan, is considering setting up a second assembly centre in Mexico to serve U.S. customers with minimal reliance on China.\n\n“People are seeing China as a major source of risk,” he said."

Markets in Australia and New Zealand minted record highs.\n\n“The lowering of interest rates, cutting of corporate tax rates, increasing money supply...these are all seen as very strong responses” from China, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\nThe prospect of central bank support and easier money also underpinned bonds, with U.S. Treasury yields steady, with benchmark 10-year yields last at 1.5815%.\n\nOvernight pan-regional STOXX 600 index in Europe rose 0.8% to a record high.

            "content": "Homelessness has become pervasive in California, from the rural north to the coastal cities, and it has exposed the stark inequality in the state, whose economy would rank as the world's fifth largest if it were an independent country. Living in the shadow of the biggest names in technology — just a few dozen miles from the campuses of Apple, Google and Facebook — are hundreds of clusters of homeless people, in makeshift compounds that resemble some of the world's most destitute refugee camps. Tents sit on a sidewalk along a road in Los Angeles. Credit:Bloomberg Yet the political resistance Newsom faces in addressing the issue was quickly made clear on Wednesday, local time . It was evident in the lukewarm response he received when he challenged legislators to revive a bill that died in the state Senate just last month, a major piece of legislation that would override local zoning rules to allow new high-density housing near public transport lines. Newsom said California could not wait any longer to build more housing. The hard truth is for too long we've ignored this problem,\" Newsom said. \"We turned away. Gavin Newsom, California governor\n\n\"The public has lost patience, you have all lost patience, and so have I,\" Newsom said. Newsom laid out a series of proposals, and repeated an offer to work with the Trump administration, which has used the issue as a political cudgel, taking Democratic leaders to task for presiding over a worsening homelessness crisis despite billions of dollars spent to address it. A person sits near stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. California experienced the sharpest rise of homelessness of any state last year. Credit:Bloomberg In the running battles between California and the Trump administration, the President and conservative media have hammered Democrats over the street conditions of many California cities, citing hypodermic needles and human waste picked up from sidewalks. On Tuesday, Trump threatened to intervene in Los Angeles ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics if the city didn't \"clean it up fast\".\n\nLoading \"If they can't do it themselves, we're going to do it,\" Trump said a traditionally non-political briefing for the Games' preparations. \"The federal government is going to take it over, we're going to do it.\" The President also has repeatedly lashed out against the mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, who represents a San Francisco district, over the homeless issues in those cities. The President has referred to the crisis in the two California cities as \"disgusting\" and a \"disgrace to our country.\" Newsom's call for urgent measures comes less than two weeks before the primaries of Super Tuesday, when California will be a key focus, and at a time when inequality remains a sustained talking point in the race for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nLoading In his speech, Newsom pointed out a stark dichotomy in California's economy. It has world-beating technology companies, and grew by an average of 3.8 per cent annually over the past five years, faster than the United States overall, which expanded by 2.5 per cent a year over the same period. California, the governor remarked, \"is the rocket fuel powering America's resurgence.\" Yet federal data show that California was also by far the largest contributor to the increase in homelessness across the nation last year. The state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country, driven to a large degree by high housing costs. The average purchase price of a home in the state now exceeds $US500,000 ($750,000). Homelessness declined in most states in 2019, compared with the year before, according to a report published in January by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. But in the state, it increased by 16 per cent, or 21,306 people, the report said.\n\nNearly half of all unsheltered people in the US live in California, though the state accounts for just 12 per cent of the US population. Newsom called homelessness a national crisis in his speech, but did not acknowledge the outsized role that California plays in the problem. Nearly half of all unsheltered people in the US live in California, though the state accounts for just 12 per cent of the US population. But Newsom did not hold back from describing the severity of the problem, saying at one point, \"We own it.\" Parts of the governor's speech called for immediate, concrete measures. He announced that 286 state-owned properties, including fairgrounds, armouries and vacant lots, were available as of Wednesday for local governments to use for \"homelessness solutions.\" One hundred camping trailers used by the state during emergencies would be deployed across the state for temporary shelter, he said.\n\nA man fills a water container from a fire hydrant near tents in Los Angeles, California. Credit:Bloomberg Over the past two years, California has allocated $US1.5 billion to help local governments deal with homelessness. Newsom said the Legislature should dedicate permanent revenue streams to fighting the problem. Newsom focused on people with mental health problems, and called on the Legislature for an additional $US695 million to help them. He also called for a commitment \"right now, this year\" to eliminate red tape and delays in building critically needed housing. Even with all the additional funding to combat homelessness, Newsom faces an uphill battle. For decades, many efforts to build housing have been stymied by resistance at the local level — mayors, supervisors and their constituents. \"I respect local control, but not at the cost of creating a two-class California,\" Newsom said.\n\nThere are an estimated 59,000 homeless people living in Los Angeles County, according to a point-in-time count conducted earlier this year by the county; the figure is about a 12 per cent increase from 2018. Of those, about 44,000 were estimated to be unsheltered, or 75 per cent. California voters have heard countless promises to end homelessness in recent decades, only to see the problem grow worse. Newsom closed his speech with lines that his antagonists may keep in their back pockets. \"I don't think homelessness can be solved — I know homelessness can be solved,\" the governor said. \"This is our cause. This is our calling.\" The New York Times, AP"

[Operator Instructions]. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Dan Bachus, CFO. Sir, you may begin.\n\nDan Bachus -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you. Joining me on today's call is our Chairman and CEO, Brian Mueller. Please note that many of our comments today will contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Various factors could cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such statements.\n\nThese factors are discussed in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We undertake no obligation to provide updates with regard to the forward-looking statements made during this call, and we recommend that all investors review these reports thoroughly before taking a financial position in GCE. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Mueller -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to Grand Canyon Education's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. We are now almost 20 months into our existence as an education services Company. I want to do two things on this call, first, talk about how we think GCE should be positioned in the macro environment within higher education. And second, review the financial results that have been produced to date.\n\nAs I have indicated previously, it is GCE's goal to help address the real issues within higher education. I believe, to have a long-term future as an education services Company, you must provide solutions to those challenges. The challenges are: One, college cost too much; Two, students are taking on way too much debt relative to their income earning potential; Three, as tuition goes up, diversity on college campuses go down; Four, bachelor's degree should not take four to six years; Five, programs are not tied directly enough to where jobs are; Six, there are inadequate counseling and support services, especially for first generation students or those studying at a distance.\n\nWe are very excited about GCE's direction relative to the challenges facing students, families and the industries we are serving. In 2020, GCE's 23 partner institutions, project to produce over 30,000 graduates. Over 11,000 healthcare professionals, 7,700 education professionals, 4,600 in the business world, 3,600 in behavioral health, 2,500 in Public Service, Social Science and theology, and 600 in Engineering and Computer Science.\n\nThese students will graduate with less Title IV debt than the average state and private university students in this country. They will have less than a 6% cohort default rate on student loans, will graduate from programs that passed the previous debt-to-income earning ratios that were part of the gainful employment rules and less than 75% of the revenues that are generated will be from Title IV programs.\n\nGCE has four pillars in its business and the first three are addressing these issues head-on, and we believe eventually the fourth pillar will as well. Grand Canyon University online had 82,540 students online as of December 31st, 2019, and in the quarter just completed, new students grew in the mid-single digits, while total students grew 6.5% year-over-year.\n\nGCE's core business margin expanded 150 basis points for the year just completed, with the net tuition increase that averaged less than 1% at GCU online. This is important, because GCE will continue to invest heavily in a new online management platform, is investing in over 100 software applications to provide operational support for students and faculty and will assist GCU in rolling out more than 20 new programs in 2020.\n\nThe GCE-GCU partnership is a strong proven model that produces high-quality outcomes and GCE can produce similar results for other institutions. What has been demonstrated in the first 20 months is that the comprehensive operational services offered in exchange for the revenue split is working better than expected for both sides.\n\nThe second pillar is the GCU traditional campus. The traditional campus started the fall semester with approximately 21,000 students, of which approximately 13,000 are residential, which is up 9.3% over the previous fall. GCU's campus is profitable without raising tuition in eleven years and has invested over $1.5 billion in academic and other campus infrastructure.\n\nThe campus currently ranks as the 19th best college campus in the nation according to niche.com. This is a remarkable accomplishment given that the University really started to build out its campus only eight years ago, receives no state tax subsidies, and has no meaningful endowment or donor base. There were some observers who predicted that the GCE-GCU partnership would produce good financial results for GCE and would not work financially for GCU, they were very, very wrong.\n\nThe University has publicly made available its financial statements for the year ended June 30th, 2019 that show the University had over $325 million in cash on its balance sheet, had net assets over $387 million at June 30th, 2019 and its cash flows from operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 were over $123 million. The positive results for the University continued in the six months ended December 31st, 2019.\n\nBased on interim financial statements provided to us by GCU in which GCU has authorized us to discuss it, the University's cash balance as at December 31st, 2019 was approximately $250 million. Its net assets grew to almost $400 million. It generated over $100 million in cash flows from operations during the six-month period, while funding all of its capex through [Phonetic] its own cash reserves, while also paying down $100 million on its debt.\n\nThe University plans to continue using its excess cash to fund its continued growth and pay down its debt. This was all done without tuition increases on the ground campus and a less than 1% increase in net tuition on its online campus. The third pillar of the GCE strategy is Orbis. This was the strategy most misunderstood and most underestimated by investors. This purchase greatly accelerated GCE as an education services Company and it addresses issues that have hurt many of the other OPMs.\n\nOrbis fits in the GCE strategic plan because it originated as a result of a huge marketplace need. The US will need one million additional nurses in the next five years alone as well as thousands of nurse practitioners and occupational therapists and is using a very innovative delivery model. Orbis, like GCU online, and GCU ground will be profitable. The profits will be reinvested into Orbis to create more opportunities, both in terms of locations and adding programs to current locations. Self-sustaining economic models that don't rely on taxpayer subsidies or philanthropic donations are a huge benefit to the economy and state budgets.\n\nOrbis' growth has been greatly accelerated as a result of GCE's considerable support. Since we bought Orbis, six university partners have been added. And as of to-date we are up to 23 total university partners. At the end of the acquisition, we had 18 sites opened at 11 of Orbis Education's University partners. As of today, we have expanded to 23 sites locations opened at 14 of Orbis' -- Orbis Education's university partners.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to open eleven sites locations in the next 12 months, seven in the fall of 2020 and four in the spring of 2021 which would put us at 34 locations by the spring semester of 2021. The creative delivery model which combines on ground lab work with online delivery of course content is producing tremendous outcomes for students, the healthcare community and university partners.\n\nThousands of Americans will be able to pursue their dream of becoming healthcare professionals making tremendous contributions to the healthcare industry because of these partnerships. GCE will continue to support Orbis with capital, marketing and operation support including advanced technologies. In terms of metrics, the graduation rates are approximately 90%, and the first time pass rate on the NCLEX exam are consistently over 90%.\n\nGCU's nursing program in the last three quarters produced over 95% first time pass rates. Orbis revenues grew 30.2% on a year-over-year basis for the three months ended December 31st, 2019 and 42.7% on a pro forma basis including the 21 days in January prior to our acquisition for the year ended December 31st.\n\nEnrollments on a comparable basis have grown 24.3% [Phonetic] year-over-year as of December 31st, 2019. Every new location opened represents an opportunity for GCE that has greater potential than most other OPM contracts in the space. Each location opened requires less than a $3 million investment and will turn profitable in its second year of operation eventually producing greater than 30% margins, which can be reinvested into adding more programs at the site and opening more sites. The goal is to be in 70 locations in the next seven years.\n\nTo summarize, we are very focused on this Orbis opportunity for four reasons. One, the huge need the country has for healthcare professionals, especially baccalaureate prepared nurses. Two, the opportunity to grow into 70 potential locations. Three, the locations will become profitable in just their second year of operation. Four, the relatively small amount of investment needed to get locations up and running.\n\nGCE's fourth pillar is to find three or four partners interested in a more comprehensive arrangement. We are working hard at this pillar but will continue to be selective. The model of many partners, many low enrolled programs at very high price points is not interesting to us because the model doesn't fundamentally address the real challenges identified earlier in higher education.\n\nWe believe we can add tremendous value to university partners in the Midwest or Northeast and are in dialogue with a number of them. Most of them have had partners in the past and they have not been successful with those programs. Our strategy of front-end services combined with robust back-end services is clearly a differentiated approach.\n\nThe model we are suggesting is proven on a very large scale. GCU's hybrid campus having large student bodies in both major markets leveraging a common infrastructure has been successful in unprecedented ways. High-quality students producing great outcomes at great value, complying with making huge investments to constantly upgrade infrastructure as a matter of fact not opinion.\n\nEverybody that visits the GCU campus goes away very impressed. Future models of higher education should be based on the results they produce and not on whether they fit into pre-existing structures. Our three -- our other three core pillars are performing well, have great potential. And as a result, we have the ability to be selective.\n\nIf we find the right comprehensive partner, we will sign an agreement. If you look at the contracts of other OPMs in the space, those contracts would most likely be dilutive rather than accretive to our current plan. In addition, the huge upfront investments of those arrangements would place significant risk on to our current business.\n\nWith that, I would like to turn it over to Dan Bachus, our CFO to give a little more color on our 2019 fourth quarter, talk about changes in the income statement, balance sheet, and other items as well as to provide 2020 guidance.\n\nDan Bachus -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Brian. Included in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC, we have included non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share for the three months ended December 31st, 2019. The non-GAAP amounts exclude the tax-affected amount of the amortization of intangible assets and the loss on transaction amount included in our consolidated income statement.\n\nThe amortizable intangible assets acquired in the Orbis acquisition totaled $210.3 million and amortization expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $2.2 million. We believe the non-GAAP financial information allows investors to develop a more meaningful understanding of the Company's performance over time.\n\nAs adjusted, non-GAAP diluted income per share for the three months ended December 31st, 2019 is $1.63. Service revenue was slightly below our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to slightly lower revenue per student from GCU due to timing differences in online student starts and a slightly higher scholarship rate as the number of partnerships continues to grow.\n\nAs we have discussed previously, overall enrollment growth is being pressured by the fact that professional study students and ground commuter students are flat, slightly down year-over-year, but revenue per student continues to increase as we continue to see very encouraging growth in the areas of our focus including online, residential and Orbis enrollment, where revenue per student is the highest.\n\nIn addition, Orbis enrollments at year-end were down from Q3 due to the timing of graduations as it relates to our 60-day enrollment count methodology. These trends have been included in 2020 guidance. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 18.6% compared to 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and are guiding [Phonetic] to 22.6%. The lower rate is due to favorable adjustments related to state income taxes, partially offset by slightly lower excess tax benefits of $0.1 million in Q4 2019 from $1.2 million in Q4 2018, $0.08 of the earnings beat is due to the lower effective tax rate.\n\nWe repurchased 201,522 shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2019 at a cost of approximately $18.5 million and another 114,336 shares at a cost of $9.5 million subsequent to December 31st, 2019. We had $52.3 million available under our share repurchase authorization as of December 31st, 2019. Our Board recently increased our share repurchase [Phonetic] authorization by another $75 million.\n\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flows. Total unrestricted cash and short-term investments at December 31st, 2019 were $143.9 million. GCE capex in the fourth quarter of 2019 including capex for new Orbis partner sites was approximately $7.2 million or 3.3% of net revenue. Capex for the year was $22.4 million which fell within our anticipated range of between $20 million and $25 million.\n\nWe anticipate that amount [Phonetic] growing to between $30 million and $35 million in 2020 due to the build-out of the eleven Orbis partner locations. We provided no funding to GCU for capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2019, but received a payment of $40 million on the outstanding loan in October.\n\nAs a reminder to investors the note due from GCU is secured by all of its assets. Given this, it is very difficult for the university to get financing from any other source than GCE. GCU has informed us that it has the ability to fund its capital expenditures going forward. But under the agreement, we are required to provide them funding if they want to borrow for short-term cash flow purpose.\n\nLast, I would like to provide color on the guidance we have provided for 2020. The guidance we have provided continues to be non-GAAP as adjusted net income and as adjusted diluted income per share, as we exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets. As you have probably noticed, we have again provided estimates for each quarter of 2020. We do this because our financial results including GCU and the partners at Orbis services are very seasonal. Although we have again provided total enrollment guidance for 2020, but our focus continues to be on revenue and not enrollment, as we focus on growing the number of students that drive the most value to our institutional partners.\n\nTotal enrollments are expected to be 108,000, 96,300, 116,100 and 114,100 at the end of the first, second, third and fourth quarter respectively. The underlying assumptions behind the total enrollment growth consists of total online enrollment growth that ranges between 6% and 6.5%; residential student growth of approximately 10% in both the spring and full terms, flat to down year-over-year professional studies commuter students and traditional summer school enrollment, and Orbis enrollments of 4,000 at the end of the first and second quarters 4,700 at the end of the third quarter and 4,500 at the end of the year.\n\nOnline enrollments will be pressured in the first half by year-over-year increases in graduated students that exceed total enrollment growth, but we anticipate that this will moderate in the second half of the year and thus year-over-year growth should increase in the second half. We estimate that Orbis revenue will be $115.8 million in 2020. Orbis revenue on a pro forma basis in 2019 was approximately $89.1 million, including the $3.3 million in revenue not recognized in our financials, given that the close of the transaction occurred on January 22nd, 2019.\n\nThus on a pro forma basis, we anticipate Orbis revenue will be up 30% year-over-year. We estimate the revenue pursuit from our contract with GCU will be up year-over-year primarily due to the growth in residential students. On the expense side, we anticipate the core GCE business will see flat margins year-over-year while Orbis will be EBIT zero excluding intangible amortization.\n\nLast year, we had projected the core GCE business margins would be up 30 basis points year-over-year, but instead they were up 150 basis points exceeding our expectations by 120 basis points. The higher than anticipated margins in 2019 were primarily due to our ability to leverage our headcount costs at a rate that was better than expected. In addition, we had a very favorable year in employee benefit costs.\n\nRecent trends suggest that we will see a 30 basis point increase in benefit cost year-over-year. In addition, increased investment is being made in technology headcount, and counseling services that will put pressure on GCE margins. Orbis EBIT excluding the intangible amortization in 2019 was approximately $5.6 million, but its pro forma EBIT was approximately $2.7 million as it lost approximately $2.9 million during the period in January prior to closing.\n\nOrbis' decline in EBIT year-over-year is due to the cost that will be incurred in 2020 associated with the eleven site openings in Fall 2020/Spring 2021. We anticipate technology and academic services, counseling services and support, marketing and communications and general administration expenses will be approximately 13%, 28.4%, 18.5% and 5.6% in net revenues and thus consolidated as adjusted operating margin will be 35% -- 34.5% in net revenues.\n\nWe estimate interest expense -- I'm sorry, interest income on the note from GCU will be approximately $59.2 million, down slightly from $59.3 million in 2019. The University might further pay down the note in 2020, but further paydowns are not factored into our guidance. We estimate interest expense will be approximately $5.6 million compared to $11.3 million in 2019 due to our paydowns on our outstanding loan.\n\nOther interest income will be approximately $2.4 million. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate excluding contributions made in lieu of state income taxes to be 23.8% for the year; 23.3% in Q1; 24.2% in Q2; 24.2% in Q3; and 23.6% in Q4. Our effective tax rate will be up significantly from 2019 and will be more in line with our statutory rate.\n\nIn 2009, we received a significant tax refund in the first quarter and favorable state tax adjustments in the fourth quarter. We do not anticipate any similar refund in 2020. In addition, we anticipate that we will receive a significantly lower excess tax benefit deduction in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to lower stock option exercises and a lower stock price.\n\nIf contributions in lieu of state income taxes are made in the third quarter of 2020, that will have the effect of increasing our operating expenses and lowering our effective tax rate in the second half of the year. The weighted average shares outstanding amount includes stock that was repurchased through today. Although we might repurchase additional shares during 2020, these estimates do not assume repurchases other than those already made.\n\nI will now turn the call over to the moderator so that we can answer questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Paris with Barrington Research. Your line is open.\n\nChris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon, this is Chris Howe sitting in for Alex. I appreciate all the color provided on this call. First, I wanted to focus on the pillar of Orbis. You mentioned the seven sites planned for the fall of 2020 with four sites in the spring of 2021, as you accelerate toward 70 locations. As we look at your guidance for revenue as being up 30%, how should we look at the contribution from these seven new sites in the fall of 2020 versus potential new partners? Are there any new partners that are being considered, or is this excluding any additional partners in fiscal year '20?\n\nDan Bachus -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, so the revenues in 2020 for those seven new sites is pretty minimal because we only have the first cohorts at those seven locations that will be revenue in the fourth quarter a little bit in the third, but mostly in the fourth quarter of 2020. But, the revenues will grow significantly as those -- we have second, third, fourth cohorts into '21 for those new locations. In terms of additional partners, Orbis continues to sign additional partners. Those additional partners obviously four of those will be opening in spring of 2021. And then, our expectation at this point is, we'll have additional openings in the fall of 2021. But at this point, it's too early given the regulatory and other things that they have to go through to predict exactly how many locations will open in fall of 2021. Anything to add, Brian?\n\nBrian Mueller -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\n\nThe only thing is that the difference between a new partner in a new location and taking an existing partner in a new location, the expense associated with that, the difference is very little. They'll be a little bit more expense, when you take a new partner in, because their curriculum has to be approved and you've got to take steps with the state board. But, it's basically $1.5 billion [Phonetic] to build the site and another a little bit less than $1.5 billion of loss in terms of marketing and recruiting new students. But the cost whether it's taking a new partner in or an existing one, there's very little difference in that.\n\nChris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\n\nThat's great and very helpful. And shifting to the fourth pillar. The ability to add three or four new partners whether it be in the Midwest or Northeast. Can you share some color as to how your offering perhaps has been enhanced in this past year as you continue to analyze the mix of your pipeline? And has there been any change in the mix of your pipeline in regard to whether it be faculty opposition, faculty acceptance or just some additional color on where you stand as far as your progression with some of these contracts potential?\n\nBrian Mueller -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\n\nYeah. There's really two things that you have to overcome, we have to overcome. And the first thing is very surprising and it is the result of what's happened in the last six months. We are less and less likely to do a deal for the sake of doing a deal and launching something, because of how well we're doing with our other three pillars.\n\nIt's -- the chances that something, a new deal that is not a great deal dilutes our current momentum, we don't want to do that. And so our own success is working against that fourth pillar a little bit. The second thing that you have to overcome is their understanding that we won't do it unless it's a comprehensive approach that scales the number of students, so that something fundamental about their business plan changes. We're really focused on those problems that are facing higher education.\n\nIf you look at what a lot of OPMs are doing, they're just charging more. They're not charging less. There is no benefit in this for students families, and families. The way we're thinking about it is, if you find a partner where you can scale an online program and then you can leverage the infrastructure of the University and the infrastructure of GCE in a way that eventually the economics works better for that institution and they can actually lower tuition, those are the kinds of things we're trying to make happen in that kind of an arrangement. When a University starts thinking about things like admissions, transcript evaluations, schedule building, financial aid, all of those things they get nervous about turning that over to somebody.\n\nNow we have to walk through all the systems that we use. The fact that we've had these major audits with zero findings based upon Title IV or VA and so it's a matter of overcoming our own success and it's also a matter of convincing a University that a one-off approach to this is not something that interests us. And then we got to convince them that, in order for this to work, you've got to trust us with those back-end functions because without that, these things don't work. And I'll tell you, it's amazing to me.\n\nI'm so excited about the Orbis thing because it's amazing to me, the number of people that we've talked to that have previous arrangement with OPMs that did not work. And when you look at why they didn't work, it frequently is around the OPM offering a little help upfront, marketing, enrollment, curriculum conversion not offering any assistance on the back end, so the university has to add resources on the back end, which cut in significantly to their revenue split.\n\nAnd the more we watch this -- the more that we think that applying the GCU, GCE methodology is really the only way to do it in a scalable way that works for everybody, including students and the families.\n\nChris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\n\nThank you. And as we look at Orbis and the strong position Orbis has with its existing partners, is there a way to think of this as an opportunity for cross-pollination into your three or four potential partners?\n\nBrian Mueller -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\n\nI think eventually yes, I think that would be a great way to do it. And we're just going to keep executing. We're going to stay really focused. We're going to stay real focused on continuing to execute at a high level, produce great outcomes, and let the noise out there dissipate based upon our execution. And we are in this for the long run, we want to provide real meaningful change in higher education. And so we'll be patient and we'll let the noise be what the noise is and we'll keep producing results that work for families.\n\nOne of the things that we like to do is get universities down here to visit our campus and we just open the campus up to them. And what they're amazed at is the loyalty that GCU students have to the institution, and the loyalty the families have to the institution. Because, compared to what they were thinking about before they became involved with us, this deal is so good for them that it's like they've got a new lease on life.\n\nAnd so many of -- so much of what's going on now in our ground campus is brothers and sisters, and the younger friends because they're looking at private university options that are $60,000 to $70,000, they come down here, they look at this campus, they look at the programmatic offerings, they look at the cost, and the word spreads.\n\nAnd those -- that concern that we have as GCU -- as GCU now, GCE, a for-profit Company helping a non-profit and really thinking seriously providing for the greater good is going to become a big part of this story.\n\nChris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst\n\nThank you for taking my questions. I appreciate the color, Brian and Dan.\n\nBrian Mueller -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJeffrey Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much. Forgive me I got dropped off the call, I'm not sure if you've addressed the issue with the Department of Education that you talked about last quarter, I'm just wondering if there's any progress there? Thanks.\n\nBrian Mueller -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\n\nWell, the first -- and thank you for that Jeff. The first thing we have to always remind people probably not you, but others, 95% of what we wanted we got. We have a full program participation agreement. And so, our students have access to the same Title IV programs as others. There is no restriction based upon the growth of the student body, no restriction laid upon the growth of programs and so that's a big deal for us. Having that behind us and having that path now in front of us is a big deal.\n\nThe only thing that remains is this discussion about them listing us as a proprietary institution on their website. That's the only and that's really us and them. This doesn't affect really a lot of what we're doing. We are having I believe productive discussions. It's very, I think important for them to know that we will not accept any designation that number one is not true. We're not a proprietary institution. We are a non-profit institution and we're not going to mislead the public about that.\n\nBut secondly and most importantly, the University is not going to accept any secondary designation which limits its potentials in the areas of research, grant writing, our faculty and our students will have the same access to participate in the academy in this country that any other faculty and student has. And accepting a designation that makes -- that might make that less than is not something that they're going to do or in the case of me as the President, not something I am going to do as the President of the University.\n\nI think we are making progress. We had a meeting out there. They asked for some responses. We gave it to them. They asked for something else and we're in the process of doing that. But I hope that at some point, they will say, you know, this thing is working so well for students and for families and your neighborhood, etc that we really need to be doing more of this not less than this. I really hope the discussion flips to that, because I think that would -- that's where it should be.\n\nJeffrey Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nOkay, that's great. I appreciate the color. Dan, when you were giving some color on your outlook, I think you said to expect flat margins in the core GCE this year. You called out a number of items as to why. I know you're not giving behind guidance beyond that. But is that something we should expect going forward if we exclude these one-time items that margins will continue to expand in GCE?\n\nDan Bachus -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nI think we'll have to see. I mean, frankly, we're at a margin level as a -- in -- from the GCE core business that I think is higher than we thought we would get to anytime in the next few years as I said. We -- our business plan has always been to grow the core GCE margins 30 basis points a year and 30 basis points that would be five years to get to the $150 million that we did in one year. And so, I think the question is, can we grow margins? Quote those core margins higher in the future, or is it better just to keep those core margins where they are today, because we will see significant margin expansion from Orbis over the next few years.\n\nAnd so I don't know I think is the short answer. We'll see. But I think you should expect to see margin expansion from the consolidated business in 2021 over 2020 driven by Orbis' growing margins.\n\nJeffrey Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nOkay. That's what I was going to ask as my follow-up question. So thank you for answering that. And just one more quick one, you gave a little bit of color on the enrollment, I guess slowing down a little bit. You went through that a little bit quickly. Can you just repeat what you said what happened in the fourth quarter? I know you gave us some guidance for the year, but just if we can get the color on the fourth quarter that will be great.\n\nDan Bachus -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, actually our enrollments were generally in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter other than Orbis was about 200 [Phonetic] lower than we expected. It had to do with the timing of graduations. We thought the graduations we count -- the way we count enrollment in the 60-day count at the end of the year. And so the third and fourth quarter for Orbis would be roughly the same. It turns out the way we count them, they were out of our count methodology by the end of the year. And so that didn't affect revenue at all, but it did affect those enrollments. But other than that, enrollments were generally in line with our expectations.\n\nThe new starts were also for the quarter right in line with our expectations. They just actually came a little bit later in the quarter than we had forecasted, which had a very minor impact on revenue per student, but other than that, the quarter was right in line with our expectations.\n\nJeffrey Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Really appreciate you clarifying that. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nJeffrey Meuler -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\n\nYeah, a follow-up I think on the second question there from the other Jeff. So, how are you thinking about Orbis on a multi-year basis? It sounds like you're planning on expanding margins after 2020, but like -- is there a way to size up for us how many campuses per year you can open while expanding margins, or what Orbis' normalized growth rate can be if you want to expand margins?\n\nDan Bachus -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, I think very big picture. As long as we open a similar number of locations in the 12 months, because it's really not the way that spending works as we've talked about before if it opens in the fall or in the spring, the costs are all primarily incurred in the calendar year leading up to that. And so as long as -- when we look at fall of 2021/spring of 2022, as long as the number of locations are eleven or less, I think you should plan to see some pretty nice margin expansion.\n\nIf somehow we go from eleven to 15, which I think is very unlikely, I think you'll have a similar phenomenon to this year where we went from four/five location to eleven. But if we open eleven or less, which I think is the more likely scenario for that next 12-month period, I think you will see pretty significant margin expansion as you would have seen this year if we would have just opened four or five in that fall spring time period, you would have seen $10 million-plus worth of earnings at Orbis in 2020.\n\nJeffrey Meuler -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And then, I know that the mid-single-digit online new enrollment is in line with the longer term plan and you're saying it was in line with Q4 and it was similar to Q3. But just on a multiyear basis, you were pretty nicely outperforming that for a while and I get that your scale level is getting bigger now, but would just love any perspective on, are there fewer programs being launched over the last year than there were a few years ago? Is it scale challenges? Is there anything with marketing efficiency impacts from the Department of Education's decision?\n\nBrian Mueller -- Chief Executive Officer, President and Director\n\nWe continue to do this very strategically. There is a huge focus on quality, quality students in the high-demand programs, high graduation rates, and we'll continue with that. What you'll see, and we've been saying this, the spread between enrollment growth and revenue growth is going to continue.\n\nAnd eventually, I think for investors this should be primarily about revenue and earnings, because we're going to continue to focus on high-quality students, putting them into high-quality programs that are going to produce great results from there -- from them, from a career standpoint. If we open the floodgate today and say we'll take a bunch of high-risk 30-year-old students who want to come back to school and try it again, and those students produce low graduation rates, stack up debt, don't get any payoff, that way to grow based upon that level of churn is not something we're interested in.\n\nAnd so, our marketing spend as a percent of revenue is about the same. And the productivity is about the same. And then -- and so I think as this thing moves forward, you're going to see us continue to focus on residential students on our campus, to focus on graduate students online, and to focus on Orbis students, and keep pushing that revenue number up.\n\nDan Bachus -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Jeff, the other -- the only other thing I would add is obviously mid-single digits is in a finite number. Our goals are to grow new starts greater than 5%. So the numbers we're talking about are still pretty significant given our overall size. Our expectations have not declined at all. But mid-single digit is -- is like I said, there's a range there, and our goal is to be at I guess the higher end of that mid-single-digit range.\n\nJeffrey Meuler -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\n\nOkay, got it. Thank you.\n\nDan Bachus -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nWith that, we have reached the end of our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your time and interest in Grand Canyon Education. If you still have questions, please contact myself, Dan Bachus.

Some will test small cell technologies, while others will see how recent Ofcom regulations governing shared spectrum can be used in practice.\n\nOne of the projects, 5G New Thinking, will see Cisco and others apply learnings from the 5GRural First initiative in Orkney, Somerset and Shropshire.\n\nAnother one of the initiatives will see 5G power Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR & VR) applications for tourists in Sherwood Forest, while other use cases include air and sea rescue services and environmental monitoring. A total of £5 million has been awarded to two industrial projects to see how 5G can boost productivity in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe government has also launched a new £30 million competition for the creative industries. Applications are being urged from the film, television, video game and tourism sectors.\n\n“We're determined to make the UK a world-leader in 5G and deliver on our promise to improve connections for people and businesses across the country,” said newly-appointed digital secretary Oliver Dowden.\n\n“Today we’re announcing new funding to seize the new opportunities this technology will offer us. This includes seeing how it could create new jobs in the countryside, make businesses more productive and unleash even more ideas in our cutting-edge creative industries.”\n\nThe UK had hoped its startup ecosystem would ensure it played a key leadership role in the development of 5G and these ambitions have been strengthened by the commercial launch of four 5G networks. Three became the final mobile operator to switch its on 5G mobile services last week."

            "content": "Image: Getty Images\n\nAustralia has officially opened its own space agency in Adelaide after it was found to be the only country in the OECD without its own.\n\nThe Australian Space Agency opened its Adelaide headquarters on February 19 with visits from Prime Minister Scott Morrison and science minister Karen Andrews officiating the ceremony. The new agency is located in the centre of Adelaide, wedged between the University of Adelaide and the city's botanic garden.\n\nWhy is Australia suddenly getting a space agency?\n\nIt's an interesting question because the space race hasn't been a primary focus for the Australian government for a number of years. In September 2017, Senator Birmingham announced at the 68th International Astronautical Congress the government was looking to create its own space agency.\n\nAs with all things space, it was going to need a lot of investment and three years later, PM Morrison revealed that figure at the agency's opening — around $700 million — and he expected it to bring with it a number of jobs by 2030.\n\n\"The Australian Space Agency is central to my Government's vision to secure more jobs and a larger share of the growing space economy — forecast to be over $1 trillion in size around the globe by 2040,\" Morrison said in at the agency's launch.\n\n\"That's why we're investing almost $700 million into the space sector, including $150 million into Australian businesses so they can pick up more work and support more jobs by partnering with NASA's Moon to Mars initiative.\n\n\"Our work is to transform Australia into a major space player. We're not mucking around with this. We're not playing around with this. We are fair dinkum about this. You don't put $600 million down on a dud bet,\" Morrison said in a later address to the agency.\n\nKaren Andrews, Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, said it was planning to grow the sector to $12 billion by that time.\n\n\"Space is inspirational but it's also big business. The Morrison Government is investing heavily in providing opportunity to Australians. We've set the goal of tripling the size of the sector in Australia to $12 billion and adding an extra 20,000 jobs by 2030,\" Minister Andrews said at the launch.\n\n\"But beyond that space will create opportunities for core industries — from manufacturing to mining — to tap into new supply chains.\"\n\nWe've contacted the Space Industry Association of Australia to ask what it thinks of this investment and its potential impact on the industry. We'll update when it responds.\n\nWhat will the Australian Space Agency do?\n\nThe agency will mostly be in charge of providing policy advice and space activity legislation, rather than launching Australian space missions, with it stating its primary purposes include:\n\nproviding national policy and strategic advice on the civil space sector\n\ncoordinating Australia’s domestic civil space sector activities\n\nsupporting the growth of Australia’s space industry and the use of space across the broader economy\n\nleading international civil space engagement\n\nadministering space activities legislation and delivering on our international obligations\n\ninspiring the Australian community and the next generation of space entrepreneurs\n\nAside from that, it's also teaming up with NASA to help facilitate its Moon to Mars mission, which the Morrison Government committed $150 million to in September 2019.\n\nAustralia's involvement in the mission, which attempts to see NASA encourage exploration of the Moon and Mars, is not fully known aside from the announced financial commitment. The agency launched a number of consultation sessions around the country throughout February and March to get feedback and input on how the investment can help Australian companies with space ambitions.\n\nIn 2021, the agency's head Dr Megan Clark said it also plans to open up its site to the public for educational purposes.\n\n\"What will be unusual is the mission control will be right here and we will have glass at the back so people can come in off the street and see what we are doing,\" Dr Clark said at the launch.\n\n\"We want kids and people to be able to see what's happening on the lunar surface, to be able to see what's happening in real time on the lunar orbiter, and eventually to be able to come and say 'I wonder what's happening on Mars today', and come in and see people in action.\n\n\"I think that will inspire them to take up jobs, maybe try a little bit harder in their maths and English and try and get those jobs.\"\n\nWhy Is Australia's Space Agency In South Australia?\n\nStates and territories were made to pitch for the agency headquarters but ultimately, South Australia was found to have a higher density of space-related organisations in the area. It's likely due to Adelaide's relative proximity to desert regions, which are primed for observing space.\n\n\"Work undertaken in 2018 showed that South Australia is home to 70 space-related organisations, companies and educational institutes with a workforce of over 800 and already active in the industry and working on remarkable challenges,\" Morrison said in his address to the agency's forum.\n\n\"To give an example, the government is investing to establish a world-class satellite positioning capability in Australia. The new [GPS satellite] system will deliver accuracy of within three centimetres.\"\n\nDuring the announcement back in 2018, the state's history and contributions to Australia's space aspirations was also pointed out as making sense, according to an ABC report.\n\n\"Our very first satellite was launched into space from Woomera just over half a century ago, so South Australia has demonstrated a very long history in space,\" Minister Andrews said at the time.\n\n\"Having the space agency headquartered here in Adelaide means that South Australia will certainly have a great opportunity to be a major contributor.\"\n\nWhy South Australia Is A Hotspot For Rare Fireballs Fireballs are quite rare with only a handful ever being observed. But in the South Australian desert, one of only two fireballs ever observed as falling into the Earth and Moon's gravitational system was spotted. Dr Ellie Sansom from Curtin University told Gizmodo Australia about the unicorn event and why the region is one of the best places in the world to observe them. Read more\n\nDid Australia have a space agency before?\n\nAustralia had a former space agency for seven years, but it was made defunct in 1996 by the Howard Government. The Australian Space Office was created in 1987 in order to oversee the National Space Program — a policy initiative set by the Keating Government. It was the first time a dedicated office would oversee a clear set of space policy.\n\nSadly, the initiative was considered a failure and its 1996 demise was blamed on a \"lack of government commitment.\"\n\nHopefully, this space era sticks around a little longer."

It should not be surprising that the World Health Organization (WHO), a branch of the United Nations, has been so aggressive in cheerleading for the Chinese government and its response to the coronavirus outbreak. After all, China's communist surveillance state model is a beta test for the type of centralization that the UN wants for the entire planet. They certainly aren't going to point out that it was China's totalitarian system that allowed the outbreak to spread from the very beginning.\n\nEven now Xi Jinping is trying to rewrite history, claiming that he had been swift in responding to the crisis more than a month before he actually did. The lie that the coronavirus mutated naturally in a food and animal market in Wuhan continues to be peddled by the mainstream media even though no evidence supporting this claim exists. And China is still releasing rigged death and infection numbers while they have over 600 million people under martial law lockdown and their crematoriums continue pumping out the fumes of the dead 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\n\nBrave health workers like Li Wenliang, who was punished by the government for warning about the virus in December, have died in the process of trying to fight against the centralized behemoth just to get vital information to the world, but that never happened, right? It was actually president Xi and the CPC that saved the day. The WHO and the CPC say so. You'll never hear the UN praise the efforts of Li Wenliang; they want his name to disappear down the memory hole as much as the Chinese government does.\n\nThe developing narrative is a familiar one – Local officials “stifled” the response to the outbreak while the centralized national leadership put things back on track with extreme control measures that have turned the Hubei province into a veritable internment camp. Whatever you do, don't point out that it was the national government's habit of imprisoning health officials that release “false information” that led to the delayed reaction on the coronavirus. Also, don't point out that ground zero for the outbreak is just down the road from the largest Level 4 Biohazard Lab in Asia, because that would make you a “conspiracy theorist”.\n\nThe message being pounded into the public consciousness is clear: \"Shut up and accept that Centralization works\". Even when it fails miserably, it is still the answer to all our problems. All we have to do is “adjust” the historical record a little bit every time the system breaks and then institute even MORE centralization in response.\n\nIn other words, if the interdependent and draconian top-down structure of the globalist state leads to crisis, then it is because it was not centralized ENOUGH. Centralization always begets more centralization.\n\nThe financial fascist system of central banking and corporate oligarchy leads to the socialist welfare state, and the socialist welfare state leads to the surveillance state, the surveillance state leads to the martial law state, and the martial law state leads to full-on global governance; an endless elitist empire.\n\nThe failings of centralization have caused numerous problems long before it led to a potential pandemic. The pandemic simply clarifies the issue. For example, the breakdown in the global supply chain is becoming a bigger threat by the day. The Baltic Dry Index a measure of shipping rates as well as global demand for goods, has essentially collapsed. This should have been the first warning sign that the supply chain was in trouble, but the mainstream doesn't pay attention to the fundamentals, only stock markets. Enter Apple, one of the largest companies in the world, which has now abandoned its projections for 2020 and finally admitted that the shutdown of Chinese factories may just be a problem.\n\nSome mentally challenged people out there are scoffing sarcastically at this issue, saying \"Oh no, whatever will we do without i-Phones...?\". They don't grasp the wider implications. If Apple's production is going down because of the supply chain disruption then this is a signal that multiple companies and most of the economy are also going down because of supply chain disruptions. It's not about i-Phones, it's about the bigger picture.\n\nGlobalism has led to interdependent economies and nation states that no longer have redundancies in production. We have been forced to rely on production centers on the other side of the world for a vast majority of our goods.\n\nWhen China shuts down, the US economy loses almost 20% of its supply chain. When Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam shut down from the virus, you can add another 10% to 15% on top of that. Retailers in the US represent around 70% of GDP. Cut off the supply chain in Asia and retailers lose a vast array of goods to sell. The US economy eventually shuts down also, even if the virus never spreads here.\n\nSome people will argue that we don't need all the “cheap plastic crap” from Asia anyway, and this situation is a “good thing”. Sorry to break it to you, but America's economy is built on the selling of cheap plastic crap (along with the selling of the fiat dollar as the world reserve currency). Walmart (Chinamart if you discount agricultural products) is the largest employer in the US and the world, after all. Right or wrong, our economic system is so globalized that the fall of the Chinese dominoes will eventually knock down our own dominoes.\n\nBut when this disaster occurs and numerous national economies suffer from enforced globalist integration, guess what will happen next? The globalists will ride to our “rescue” with even greater centralization. This was their agenda all along.\n\nMany people in the liberty movement are now aware of the Event 201 simulation, a war game run by globalists in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum on a “theoretical” coronavirus pandemic that kills 65 million people. This simulation took place only a couple of months before the real thing exploded in China in December. But hey, maybe that's all just amazing coincidence. What concerns me even more is the solution that was presented at the end of Event 201 – the creation of a centralized global financial body that would manage the international response to the outbreak.\n\nIsn't it amazing how every major catastrophe caused by globalism seems to lead to more globalism? One might start to wonder if some of these events were triggered by incompetence, or if they were deliberately engineered. At the very least, crisis events have been allowed to fester unchecked by organizations like the WHO as they continue to write off the coronavirus as a non-issue that is \"well under control\" by a Chinese government that caused it to spread in the first place.\n\nSo here is what is going to happen next:\n\nBest case scenario is that the Western world is mostly unscathed by the virus itself but the economic supply chain suffers major setbacks. The global economy, which was already crashing over the past year due to historic levels of corporate and consumer debt, not to mention faltering exports and freight, is finally tipped over the edge. The massive Everything Bubble, fueled by a decade of inflationary central bank stimulus, implodes. Governments respond with totalitarian measures in the name of “protecting the public”. Globalist institutions like the IMF step in and suggest that frail national monetary systems come under the management of their Special Drawing Rights basket in order to mitigate the debt crisis. Essentially, this is the first step to global governance. Worst case scenario, the virus spreads throughout the US and Europe and governments respond the same way China's government has; martial law and full blown concentration camp culture. This would lead to civil war in the US because we are armed and many people will shoot anyone trying to put us into quarantine camps. Europe is mostly screwed. The establishment then suggests that paper money be removed from the system because it is a viral spreader. China is already pushing this solution now. Magically, we find ourselves in a cashless society in a matter of a year or two; which is what the globalists have been demanding for years. Everything goes digital, and thus even local economies become completely centralized as private trade dies.\n\nAgain, this might be an engineered event, or it might simply be that the globalists are exploiting a natural outbreak. Either way, they are not going to let a good crisis go to waste. Whether or not they succeed is dependent on several factors, but mostly, its dependent on us. How many people will buy into the notion that centralization is the answer to out problems? How many people will realize that centralization is the CAUSE of all our problems? And how many people will fight to prevent ultimate centralization under a psychopathic globalist cult?\n\nA viral outbreak is a significant danger to us all, but an even greater threat is the supposed cure. Trading our economic and social freedom in the name of stopping the coronavirus? No matter how deadly the bug, it's just not worth it.\n\n* * *"
