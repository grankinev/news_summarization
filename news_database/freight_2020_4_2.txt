            "content": "It started with the California forest fires. Ariella Granett lives in Berkeley, and stapling a paper smoke mask to fit her 8-year-old daughter's face made the planet's ills feel personal. Then, last spring, her son came home from school and announced the world was ending. His seventh grade class was told that by 2030 the harm done by climate change could be permanent. “I couldn't soften that,” Granett says.\n\nGranett rode her bike, ate little meat, composted food and garden waste. But faced with an alarmed tween, she resolved to take more drastic action. That summer, she quit flying. Soon after, with her husband, she cofounded Flight Free USA, a satellite of Sweden-based We Stay on the Ground.\n\nSee more from The Climate Issue | April 2020. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nAt climate rallies, Granett entreats strangers to keep it terrestrial. She's got the stats: Flying accounts for 2 to 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, not counting the extra damage done by burning fossil fuels at 30,000 feet. Carbon offsets don't help much. Capable electric aircraft are decades away. So the flight-free folk argue that the only good flight is one that never takes off.\n\nAcross Europe, this movement is gaining traction. (“Denmark to Japan by train—what is the cheapest option?” asks Tobias H. on a Tripadvisor forum.) Maja Rosén, who cofounded We Stay on the Ground in 2018, has reined in her wanderlust and now vacations by ferry and train, mostly in Sweden, where she lives. “I would love to go to the moon as well,” she says, “but I don't walk around thinking it's such a shame I can't.”\n\nClimate-conscious European governments have helped by imposing new taxes. Germany has been especially aggressive, nearly doubling its per-passenger tax on short-haul flights while slashing taxes on train travel. The head of the EU Commission is pushing for a jet-fuel tax that could boost fares 10 percent. Such moves are easier on a continent with a robust rail network, including high-speed trains that zip from London to Paris to Milan to Vienna to Budapest.\n\nGetting around the US on a train, by contrast, is an iffy endeavor. The US has a thin rail network and a shoddy record creating better trains. We have little to show for $10 billion allocated a decade ago for a new generation of high-speed railroads. A chunk of that money went to a planned high-speed line connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles; it's far behind schedule and over budget.\n\nChina’s new magnetic levitation train, the world’s fastest, will reach speeds of 373 mph, carrying passengers more than 600 miles in two hours while putting out less than half the emissions of a regional flight.\n\nGranett is disappointed by the long wait for that California train. But even so, she says, “it feels like choosing train over plane is voting with our dollars for investing in sustainable infrastructure.”\n\nExisting train lines can replace shorter flights that are especially tough on the planet. Regional flights (think Los Angeles to Las Vegas) burn twice as much fuel per passenger-mile as medium-haul flights (LA to Chicago), according to the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation. In the Northeast corridor between New York and Washington, Amtrak riders outnumber fliers by more than two to one. The emissions savings are significant. Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimates that Amtrak is 33 percent more energy-efficient than flying on a per-passenger-mile basis.\n\nTo extend that benefit, Amtrak could increase service in other regions laced with little-used rail lines—Chicago to Cincinnati, Minneapolis to Milwaukee, Atlanta to New Orleans. It could use some help, though. Freight train operators, who own most US tracks, frequently fail to give passenger trains the right of way, prompting 20,000 hours of Amtrak delays in 2018.\n\nBetter yet, railroads could go electric. That would be expensive: running catenary wires, building substations, and upgrading tracks costs, on average, $2.5 million per mile. And it only makes sense over longish distances. Do the work, though, and trains can run faster, cleaner, and cheaper. And those wires could do double duty, moving electricity from the remote areas where solar and wind power are easy to produce but hard to pipe into the grid.\n\nBack in Berkeley, Granett suits up to bike through the rain to her Oakland office. Six feet tall with reddish hair, she speaks quietly but passionately. Her organization asks people to avoid flying for a year, figuring that's a doable ask and that the habit might stick. The worldwide goal was 100,000 pledges not to fly in 2020; the 24,000 people who enlisted as of February won't ground any planes. But the point is largely to make people realize the damage caused with every takeoff. Granett would like to see governments raise taxes on flights and require airlines to display emissions information before a customer clicks Buy—akin to car window stickers estimating fuel economy.\n\nGranett has adjusted her lifestyle to her pledge. She quit the architecture firm for which she traveled several times a year and took a job focusing on affordable housing in the Bay Area. (Happily, the change didn't entail a pay cut.) Her family spent its winter vacation biking through San Francisco and Marin County. They're contemplating a road trip through Mexico or Canada.\n\nStill, staying grounded has consequences. Granett can't visit her brother in Italy or sister-in-law in West Africa. (They Skype.) She misses weddings and bar mitzvahs on the East Coast. At least for now. She's placing the planet's future ahead of herself and anyone she might offend. “I just think about how little time we have,” she says. “I'm thinking in emergency mode.”\n\nALEX DAVIES (@adavies47) runs the Transportation channel on WIRED.com.\n\nThis article appears in the April issue.

            "content": "During the summer of 2006, back when RJ Scaringe was working through a degree in automotive engineering at MIT, he began to wonder how difficult it might be to live within strict environmental boundaries. How much would you have to change—and how fast, for how long—if you desired to wipe away the carbon traces of your everyday life? Scaringe decided to conduct an experiment, using himself as the subject. For months, he walked, biked, or used public transportation wherever he went. He took cold showers, washed his laundry by hand, and traded his dryer for a clothesline. When he ate out, he brought his own spoon, to cut down on plastic waste.\n\n“I was tracking the data really closely,” Scaringe, a soft-spoken, genial sort with Clark Kentish glasses and short dark hair, told me recently. By summer’s end he had reached two conclusions. The first was that he still had a meaningful carbon footprint. The second was that he was disheveled and uncomfortable. “I said, holy smokes, no one will sign up for this, and if this is our plan to address climate change, we’re going to lose,” he recalled. Asking billions of people to don an unwashed hair shirt wouldn’t work; the solution would have to be rapid technological innovation.\n\nSee more from The Climate Issue | April 2020. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nSeveral years later, PhD in hand, Scaringe founded an automotive company called Rivian, named for the Indian River in Florida, near where he grew up. He’d spent his teenage years rebuilding classic sports cars and now hoped to produce a modern one of his own, powered by a hybrid system. “Almost from the very beginning, I knew in my heart something was wrong,” he said. The hybrid seemed lacking in higher purpose, and it could have limited financial potential. As Scaringe put it, “The product we were building was really failing to answer the question of: Why do we need to exist as a company?”\n\nThe answer came two years later, at the end of 2011. With Tesla poised to release the Model S, which would dominate the market for high-end electric sedans, Scaringe told his team it was time to pivot to trucks and SUVs. They might be less exciting to build than glossy roadsters, but they’d give the company an existential purpose. At the time, light-duty vehicles—the Environmental Protection Agency’s catchall term for cars, trucks, SUVs, and minivans—accounted for more than 60 percent of the country’s transportation emissions. Trucks were the thirstiest gas drinkers of them all, with EPA ratings that had hovered between 16 and 19 miles per gallon for the previous 30 years. Yet along with SUVs, they were also among the most popular vehicles on the road.\n\nIt has taken Scaringe more than a decade, but at the end of this year, Rivian’s first pickup truck, the R1T, will begin rolling off the production line in Normal, Illinois. A sister SUV, the R1S, will follow in early 2021. The wisdom of the company’s pivot is now clear: In 2019, the best-selling vehicles in the United States were the Ford F-150 (896,526 sold), the Dodge Ram (633,694), and the Chevy Silverado (575,600); the next four on the list were all SUVs. And according to the International Energy Agency, SUVs alone have done more to increase 2 2 CO 2 emissions in the past decade than planes, cargo ships, or heavy industry. The market is there, in other words, but it hasn’t yet proved willing to enter the 21st century.\n\nThe R1T and the R1S are pure battery electrics. They’re targeted less toward construction workers hauling tools than hikers taking a Subaru into the Sierras on weekends. This is by intention. Scaringe, who has read a psychographic profile or two, estimates that only around 10 percent of pickups sold in the US are used strictly for work. Many now come loaded with luxury flourishes and roomy cabins and chromium baubles. Owners drive them not around the ranch but to football games on weekends and the office on weekday mornings. Rivian designed the R1T for this 90 percent, with a focus on what Scaringe calls “ride quality” and “a demonstrably better driving experience.” The pickup walks a careful line between Detroit traditionalism and EV iconoclasm. Where Tesla’s forthcoming Cybertruck looks like origami on wheels, the R1T, slim and limber, looks more like an F-150 on a gym-and-yoga regimen."

            "content": "The need to urgently transport medical supplies, as well as continue regular cargo movement, has seen unusual re-purposing of aircraft to haul freight. Cargo is still transported on dedicated commercial freight aircraft, which are flying more than ever, as well as on military aircraft. But there has been a supply shortage with the sudden stopping of commercial flights, which carry cargo below the passenger cabin. Here are seven unusual ways aircraft are now carrying cargo.\n\n1) Test aircraft. Airbus sent an A330-800 test aircraft from Toulouse to Tianjin in order to pick up approximately two million face masks and bring them back to France. Airbus said the majority would be donated to governments.\n\nMonitoring equipment is in the cabin, and boxes of masks were loaded around the work stations.\n\nA330neo Airbus Flight From Tianjin to Toulouse Airbus\n\nThis aircraft, MSN1888, was used in the flight test campaign that concluded in February with EASA and the FAA issuing a joint Type Certification. MSN1888 first flew in November 2018 and accumulated 370 test flight hours across 132 flights. It is the second member of the A330neo family after the A330-900, which is already in service.\n\nAirbus A330-800 used to ferry medical supplies from Tianjin to Toulouse Airbus\n\nAirbus has typically retained its prototype aircraft in order to have a platform to trial improvements or for marketing purposes. The A330neo flight test campaign comprised this A330-800 and two A330-900s.\n\nMSN1888’s relief flight to Tianjin was the A330neo’s first visit to China. It also gave the airport a glimpse of a possible future: Airbus may assemble the A330neo at its Tianjin plant, which already assembles A320s and performs delivery completion work for the original model of A330s.\n\n2) Military demonstrator. After the A330-800 returned from Toulouse, some of the masks it carried were loaded onto an A400M for onward transport to Getafe, near Madrid, where the masks were delivered to the Spanish Ministry of Defence, which will then put the masks into the Spanish health system. The A400M is a purpose-built military transport aircraft. Airbus retains some, including MSN56 used on this flight, for test and demonstration purposes.\n\nAirbus A400M transports masks to Spain in support of COVID-19 crisis efforts Airbus\n\n3) The Dreamlifter. Boeing is offering its Dreamlifter for relief missions but the aircraft have not yet performed any such flights. Ordinarily the Dreamlifter transports parts for the aircraft it is named after: the 787 Dreamliner. The four Dreamlifters are heavily modified 747s enlarged to carry the 787 wings and fuselage sections that typical freight aircraft cannot carry.\n\nAn employee stands in front of the Boeing Co. 747 Dreamlifter, used for transporting large pieces of ... [+] the new 787 Dreamliner, at the company's manufacturing plant in Everett, Washington, U.S., on Thursday, April 30, 2009. Boeing Co.'s delayed 787 Dreamliner has received the Federal Aviation Administration's approval for about 45 percent of the certification needed to deliver the plane as scheduled next year, the program's chief engineer said yesterday. The Dreamliner is currently about two years behind schedule. Photographer: Kevin P. Casey/Bloomberg News BLOOMBERG NEWS\n\nWhile the Dreamlifter has three times the volume of a normal 747 freighter, much of the gain is from a taller cargo compartment. It is unclear how extensively cargo could be stacked on pallets to utilize this height.\n\nThe Dreamlifter concept is similar to Airbus’ Beluga transporter (based on the A300) and its successor, the Beluga XL (based on the A330). Airbus is not known to have offered the Belugas for relief flights (it has other aircraft available) but Airbus is considering selling the Belugas as special freighters once it decommissions them.\n\n4) Refuelling tanker. Airbus has deployed another special A330: one undergoing conversion work to become a military version called the Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT). Although commonly associated as an air-to-air refuelling tanker, it has additional capabilities from cargo transporter (as used in this flight) and medical evacuation aircraft (as France has done to move patients to less congested hospitals elsewhere in the country).\n\nAirbus’ own pilots flew the aircraft to Tianjin, the same Chinese city Airbus’ A330-800 test aircraft flew to. This relief mission picked up over four million face masks and then returned to Airbus’ plant at Getafe, near Madrid.\n\nAn A330MRTT being unloaded in Getafe (Spain) after returning from a trip to China to pick up mask ... [+] supplies. Airbus\n\n5) Planes with empty passenger seats. The first option airlines turned to was simply loading up the large cargo compartments on their big passenger aircraft and flying them without passengers. Long-haul aircraft like the 777-300ER essentially have a passenger cabin on top of a small freight aircraft. The 777 carries more cargo than the 747.\n\nCathay Pacific, Korean Air and Scoot were some of the first airlines to use passenger aircraft exclusively for cargo in this downturn. It is now a common option. Other airlines have joined, including American Airlines using a 777-300ER to transport only cargo between Dallas and Frankfurt, which it says are its first all-cargo flights since 1984 when it retired 747 freighters.\n\nUnited Airlines is flying 40 weekly cargo-only flights on passenger aircraft while Delta Air Lines will use A350s on three weekly cargo-only flights between Detroit and Shanghai. Virgin Atlantic is using 787s and A350s between London and New York.\n\nAmerican Airlines used a 777-300ER to carry only cargo between Dallas and Frankfurt American Airlines\n\n6) Cargo on seats. Airlines started maximizing cargo space by placing boxes on top of passenger seats (and in overhead bins). The seats were covered with a protective wrap before boxes were put on and secured. Austrian Airlines sent two 777-200s to Xiamen in China to pick up medical supplies. One of the first officers on the flight made a video during the loading process.\n\nAustrian Airlines 777-200 being loaded with cargo in the passenger cabin. Austrian Airlines\n\nAustrian does not normally fly to Xiamen, but other airlines are also mounting relief flights outside their normal scope. Aer Lingus has sent A330s from Dublin to Beijing, including four flights in one day. Aer Lingus does not normally fly to Beijing – or anywhere in Asia.\n\nOne of the smaller commercial jets, an Airbus A220 from Latvia’s Air Baltic, flew from Riga to China’s Urumqi to pick up medical supplies.\n\nPassenger repatriation flights are also generating unusual flight routes: Lufthansa landed in Auckland while Wizz Air, which ordinarily flies short-haul flights from Europe, mounted special repatriation flights to Canada and the U.S.\n\n7) Quasi-converted freighters. To gain even more space and flexibility to transport cargo on the main deck of passenger aircraft, airlines took out seats.\n\nGreece’s Aegean Airlines removed the seats from an A320 and A321. It expects to have at least 10 medical equipment relief flights to Asia. Aegean is paying for the aircraft, crew and other variable costs while Hellenic Petroleum’s EKO division will cover the fuel expense.\n\nAegean Airlines A321 Aegean Airlines\n\nChina Eastern removed approximately 160 seats from an A330-200, leaving 42 economy seats and all of the seats in business class (where the premium nature of the cabin adds complexity to seats, and in turn time for installation and removal).\n\nChinese airlines have been flying numerous relief flights, making it more viable to carry out this work. Aircraft seats are attached via special tracks, and there are supplementary cables, such as to power the in-seat video screen.\n\nAir New Zealand may also take out passenger seats on a 777-200, Chief Revenue Officer Cam Wallace wrote. Air New Zealand expects a sustained downturn but wants to preserve as much as possible of New Zealand’s export economy including meat, seafood and produce. Next week Air New Zealand will have 14 cargo-only flights to Shanghai.\n\nRemoving seats gives more space but does not make these aircraft true converted freighters. Airlines are not installing cargo hatches, so cargo will have to be loaded through passenger doors, which are too narrow for the cargo containers and pallets used below deck. The lower holds have built-in systems to manoeuvre and secure containers and pallets.\n\nConverted freighters typically have their man deck floor strengthened to accommodate the higher weight of cargo compared to passengers and seats. Converted freighters also remove overhead bins and other passenger furnishings in order to maximise available space and weight.\n\nFull conversion work takes weeks or months depending on aircraft size and is not readily reversible. So these interim measures to increase cargo capacity suffice while demand remains high and supply low.\n\nMost governments recognize the value and necessity of cargo. Cargo-only flights will not apply to China’s new restrictions limiting the number of foreign airlines. But India, which is temporarily banning passenger flights, is not allowing passenger aircraft to be used only to carry cargo."

Courtesy of KeepTruckin\n\nTrucking unicorn KeepTruckin laid off nearly one-fifth of its workers, the latest once-hot, venture-backed firm to be hit by the downturn.\n\nAn alum of last year’s Forbes Next Billion-Dollar Startups list, KeepTruckin reached a valuation of $1.4 billion last April as cash was pouring into the trucking industry. But as the coronavirus crisis has spread and pummeled the economy, the fortunes of KeepTruckin, which provides electronic logging devices to truckers, turned. On Tuesday, cofounder and CEO Shoaib Makani sent an email to employees that it was laying off 18% of its global workforce — a total of 349 people out of 1,900 — effective immediately. The news was first reported by trade publication FreightWaves.\n\n“Freight volume is highly correlated with economic output,” Makani told Forbes by email. “It is impossible to predict the full impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and how that will flow through to our customers, but it is clear that economic output in North America is contracting rapidly.”\n\nWhile consumers’ demand for household necessities amid the coronavirus crisis has increased, that has not been enough to offset the broader contraction. Makani noted that internal data showed a 12% reduction in vehicle activities in its network over the past two weeks, with the hardest-hit regions, including the West Coast and New England, declining by more than 20%. KeepTruckin has 65,000 customers.\n\nIn the letter to employees, Makani said that he would forgo his pay until things turned, while cofounders Ryan Johns and Obaid Khan would take 50% pay cuts. All employees with annual compensation above $50,000 who remained with the firm would be required to take a 10% salary cut, and no one would receive a bonus for 2019.\n\n“Our product roadmap has not been impacted,” Makani said. “We will continue to build modern technology that improves the safety and productivity of America’s trucking industry.”\n\nBefore launching the company in 2013, Makani, 35, worked as a venture capitalist at Khosla Ventures. The previous year, Congress had enacted new regulations requiring truckers to use an electronic logging device to stay compliant with rules about the hours they drive. Makani realized then that he could bring truckers and small trucking firms into the digital age by allowing truckers to use their phones to comply with regulations, which went into effect in 2017.\n\nAs the old-school trucking industry moved online, KeepTruckin’s revenue surpassed $60 million in 2018 and it was expected to more than triple in 2019. Makani declined to comment today on revenue. However the company’s strong growth attracted a top-notch lineup of investors including GV and Index Ventures, which put $228 million into the company and gave it a lofty valuation last year.\n\nKeepTruckin is at least the second company on last year’s Forbes’ Next Billion-Dollar Startups list to respond to the economic downturn with layoffs, following the news that energy unicorn RigUp had laid off more than 100 people. Forbes is tracking layoffs here.\n\n\n\n"

A veritable flying tractor-trailer, the 747 boasts one of the largest cargo capacities of any aircraft flying and can carry it further than most of its counterparts.\n\nWhile Boeing's latest four-engine product, the 747-8, didn't fare too well in the passenger market only being picked up by a handful of airlines, the freighter variant saw success with cargo carriers across the world.\n\nWith the US in desperate need of supplies, take a look at how Boeing 747s are once again saving the day."

            "content": "Like many other websites at the moment, the career-oriented networking platform LinkedIn has seen a big boost in traffic as a result of people being asked to work from home and stay indoors overall to slow the spread of the coronavirus, with a bump of 55% more conversational activity between existing connections in recent weeks. Now, to leverage that attention in a way that's more directly helpful during this health crisis, LinkedIn is introducing new measures specifically around job listings.\n\nFrom today and for the next three months, LinkedIn says it will provide free job postings for \"essential\" businesses globally -- companies in healthcare, as well as warehousing, supermarket, freight delivery and nonprofits working in support or relief roles -- in other words, those providing critical front-line services to keep the economy and society in motion. Healthcare will include companies working in areas like medical devices, medical practice (including hospitals) and mental health care.\n\nAlongside this, LinkedIn is creating an \"urgent jobs\" board to give these openings more priority visibility. People whose skills match up with those needed for these jobs who visit LinkedIn's jobs homepage will see the special listings highlighted. Those who sign up for job alerts with matching skills will in turn get real-time alerts of the jobs as they get posted.\n\nThe volunteer ads also link up with an expanded Recruiting for Good program to help bring in more people to work with nonprofits in both volunteer and paid roles. And those doing the recruiting will also get three months of free access to LinkedIn's talent insights tools to figure out where their (free) ads are best placed around hiring trends and more.\n\nOrganizations that have already signed up to use these include the American Red Cross of Los Angeles, the CommonSpirit Health hospital network, Doctors on Demand and New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nThe new initiatives underscore the bigger trend of how tech companies are looking to provide whatever assistance they can bring to the table in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n(Others include Google, which is trying to help with testing, while also providing a landing page for official and local information, while both Facebook and Twitter are trying to stamp out fake news while surfacing links to official organizations for help.)\n\nRecruitment -- which has traditionally been LinkedIn's biggest revenue generator (as part of Microsoft, it does not regularly report financials on its business lines) -- has been in an interesting position within that.\n\nOn the one hand, recruitment and its counterpart, employment, have been two of the essential levers in fighting this pandemic.\n\nOn the clinical front, hospitals and related care organizations are scrambling to keep up with the surge in demand for their services, leading to major recruitment drives to bring in people with relevant experience, in some cases going straight to the ranks of those who may have left the profession and now are being asked to step in again.\n\nIn the U.K., for example, some 4,500 doctors and nurses have so far answered an open call to come back into medical service (many will have moved on to other non-clinical or managerial roles in the NHS, or left the public sector, or the profession altogether, not just retired due to age), with more likely to come. And that's just on the clinical front. We're seeing a multitude of call outs across other sectors, like technology, to bring in experts in AI and other areas to help design software and hardware to slow the spread of the virus, to alleviate some of the side effects, to identify it faster and maybe even to potentially cure it.\n\nIn another vein, the closures of restaurants and public places has put a big shift on to supermarkets and other food providers to beef up their work forces to meet their rising demands. That's meant that while many people have lost their old jobs due to closures, they are getting opportunities to redeploy elsewhere.\n\n(The same goes for the collective groundswell of people who have emerged as volunteers to help others who are in need, with hundreds of thousands volunteering to help deliver medications or other essential tasks to supplement the work of front-line healthcare providers.)\n\nStory continues"

            "content": "Picture, if you will, your typical sleep apnea sufferer. Chances are he is middle-aged and overweight and snores like a freight train. Note the male pronoun. Twenty-five years ago experts believed that the condition, in which breathing is disrupted during sleep, was about 10 times as common in men as in women. Better-quality studies have since reduced that ratio to roughly three to one, but as more data come to light, it is becoming clearer that sleep apnea—and the broader category known as sleep disordered breathing—simply looks a little different in women. And that suggests it is often overlooked.\n\nSleep apnea is a concern because it raises the risk of heart attacks, hypertension, arrhythmias, insulin resistance, strokes and accidents that result from daytime sleepiness. Put simply, gasping for breath at night and not giving your body a thorough rest puts a lot of pressure on the cardiovascular system, raises adrenaline levels and ignites inflammation. Doctors diagnose apnea with a sleep test, often done at home, that measures your apnea-hypopnea index. This index reflects the average number of times an hour that you have an episode lasting at least 10 seconds during which breathing stops (apnea) or becomes so deficient that blood oxygen levels fall by 3 or 4 percent or more (hypopnea). Fewer than five such episodes an hour is considered normal. Five to 15 is mild sleep apnea, 15 to 30 is moderate and more than 30 is severe.\n\nMost home tests do not, however, examine the stage of sleep in which these episodes occur, and that may be a problem. A growing body of evidence shows that for many women disrupted breathing is concentrated in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase, which is also when dreams are most vivid and when heart and respiratory rates become less regular. A study of 2,057 men and women aged 45 to 84, published last November in the journal Sleep, found that women have just as many events as men do during the REM phase. “Whatever protection women have in non-REM sleep is not there during REM sleep,” says Christine Won, medical director of the Yale Centers for Sleep Medicine and lead study author. Disrupting REM may be especially bad for health. “Studies suggest that how many events you have during REM sleep is what really puts you at risk for cardiovascular health effects,” Won says. But because REM accounts for only about 20 percent of a person's nightly slumber, a test that averages events across the entire night can be misleading.\n\nSeveral other sex differences emerged from the new study. “One of our findings is that women have a lower arousal threshold—they are more likely to wake up at night in response to a given apnea,” says Susan Redline, senior author of the study and a senior physician at the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. This may also impact diagnosis. Women are more likely than men to briefly wake up before their oxygen level falls by more than 4 percent—the threshold used to identify and treat sleep apnea in patients covered by Medicare. When Won and Redline used a cutoff of 3 percent oxygen desaturation, many more women met the criteria for sleep apnea.\n\nThese differing patterns may help explain why women with sleep apnea are more likely to complain about morning headaches, fatigue, depressed mood and insomnia. In men, a big complaint (usually from a bed partner) is loud snoring, along with daytime sleepiness. In both sexes, apnea rates rise with obesity and age.\n\nHormones most likely play a role in these sex differences. Sleep apnea increases in women after menopause, and it is common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition characterized by high levels of testosterone. Redline notes that anatomy may also be a factor: “Men have a longer and more collapsible airway.” As for the female tendency to wake up more easily, evolutionary pressures and experience might be at work: “It may be that women evolved to wake up to tend to their children,” Redline says.\n\nThe leading therapy for apnea is the use of a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine to force air into the throat, keeping the airway open. Research suggests that it works equally well for REM and non-REM apnea. But as scientists shed more light on the varying patterns of the condition, treatment may become more tailored to the individual. Diagnostic criteria might also need to change to capture more cases in women. Medicare's 4 percent desaturation threshold is one example. And the increasing use of at-home testing rather than costlier testing in a sleep lab may be another. “If our findings are true,” Won says, “then home sleep apnea testing biases against diagnosing women.”"

            "content": "What happened\n\nShares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) traded down more than 6% on Wednesday afternoon on new projections that suggest the COVID-19 pandemic is going to be with us for some time. After losing nearly half their value in the early stages of the pandemic, FedEx shares had been trying to mount a comeback in recent weeks, but that optimism was derailed by comments by the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nSo what\n\nFedEx and other shipping stocks have been under pressure since the early stages of the pandemic, with investors worried that a slowdown in economic activity in Asia would lead to falling freight volumes globally. As the virus spread, the impact on the economy (and with it, shipping volumes) has grown more certain, causing dramatic declines in shipping stocks.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, the tone of the sell-off has softened in part thanks to a $2 trillion economic stimulus package that slowly made its way through Washington.\n\nUnfortunately, any hope for a quick recovery vanished on Tuesday night. During a press briefing, Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the scientists on the White House coronavirus task force, said that more than 100,000 Americans could die from the virus even with the most-stringent mitigation measures in place.\n\nThose comments sparked a new wave of selling on Wall Street on Wednesday, including shares of FedEx.\n\nNow what\n\nA potential recession comes at a particularly inopportune time for FedEx, which struggled in 2019 due to trade wars and a slowdown in China. The company faced revenue headwinds at the same time it was investing billions to increase its U.S. capacity.\n\nThe plan was for FedEx to see some of that investment in U.S. capacity pay off via higher shipment volumes in 2020, but with every passing day, that payoff now seems unlikely to materialize as quickly as the company (and its investors) had hoped.\n\nFedEx has a strong foundation and should be well positioned to rebound along with the economy. But it appears increasingly likely investors are going to need to wait for that eventual payoff."
