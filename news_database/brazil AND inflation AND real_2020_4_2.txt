            "content": "Many of the world's poor and developing countries could begin defaulting on their bonds in the coming weeks as the coronavirus outbreak has led to massive outflows from emerging market assets and real-world dollars being yanked from their coffers.\n\nWhy it matters: The wave of defaults is unlikely to be contained to EM assets and could exacerbate the global credit crisis forming in the world's debt markets.\n\nDriving the news: Investors pulled a record-breaking $83.3 billion from EM securities in March, dwarfing outflows seen during previous \"stress events\" like the global financial crisis, the 2014 taper tantrum, and China's devaluation scare of 2015, the Institute of International Finance says.\n\nThe outflows will be particularly damaging for emerging economies that are heavily reliant on foreign capital, especially as foreign direct investment has been drying up since early 2019 as a result of the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"The huge fiscal costs and humanitarian consequences of coronavirus could incentivize a slew of distressed governments to default on their debts,\" Edward Glossop, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote last week.\n\nThe World Bank and IMF already have called for an immediate suspension of debt payments from International Development Association countries, which are the world's poorest.\n\nHowever, both Fitch and Moody’s warned that any restructuring of private-sector debt could trigger restrictive defaults.\n\nState of play: The emerging world is being battered on all sides by a slowdown in manufacturing, cratering oil prices and the depression of aggregate demand as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe suffering expected in developed economies like the U.S. and eurozone will be compounded significantly in emerging economies, like those in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, which are expected to drive the world's growth in the coming years.\n\nThere are at least 20 EM countries that have bond yields already trading at distressed levels of more than 10 percentage points above comparable U.S. Treasuries, with Venezuela, Argentina, and Lebanon having already entered defaults.\n\nYes, but: Bullish investors are banking on the IMF and World Bank to deploy up to $1 trillion in relief to help stave off mass defaults and worst possible outcomes.\n\nYes, but, but: That may not be nearly enough.\n\nThe institute's data show total debt for 30 large EM countries reached $72.5 trillion in 2019, a 168% increase over the past decade.\n\nEM countries also have around $5.5 trillion of debt coming due this year, with a sizable percentage held by investors in the industrialized world.\n\nA number of emerging market central banks will likely begin quantitative easing measures, Capital Economics analysts say, further flooding the world with an abundance of cash never before imagined.\n\nMajor central banks from the U.S., Japan, China and the eurozone already have run up more than $21 trillion on their respective balance sheets and are expected to deliver much more in the coming months.\n\nThe big picture: Quantitative easing is an extreme measure that has an unproven track record at stimulating economic growth and has never been attempted in emerging countries, which have higher interest rates than their industrialized peers.\n\nIn the hands of potentially politically conflicted central banks like those in Brazil, Poland, Turkey and others in the emerging world, such a program carries a very real risk of spiking inflation and eroding the credibility of policymakers, says Liam Peach, Capital Economics' emerging Europe economist.\n\nGo deeper: Coronavirus could force the world into an unprecedented depression"

            "content": "While there is a decent chance of everything turning out more or less alright, investors need to be aware of the potential danger of the pandemic triggering a financial crisis.\n\nThere were similar fears in regards to fiscal and monetary measures in 2008, but the difference is that now most of the stimulus money is going into the real economy.\n\nPerhaps it is the Japanese lesson of the past few decades which is leading us to a growing perception of the idea that debt no longer matters. After all, we watched as Japan's sovereign debt as a percentage of GDP increased dramatically in the last few decades, yet the yen did not collapse, the country did not default and living standards continue to be decent.\n\nSource: Macrotrends.\n\nI should note that this data is net government debt, given that it is reduced by all government financial assets. Even so it is very high at close to 200% of GDP. It may lead many to believe that the rest of the world can follow suit and increase debt levels. It is thought that central banks, especially those which benefit from their currency having global reserve currency status can just print their way of this. The trillions of dollars that are flowing out of equities and into bonds are thought to be helping as well. Perhaps we may be right and we will be able to get past this crisis without any major financial consequences. On the other hand, it may just be the event that will unleash upon us the financial disaster that many feared we are headed into since the 2008 crisis that never arrived, which only served to further feed and reinforce our collective complacency\n\nMost major Western economies will run double-digit deficits this year\n\nIt is not yet clear how big of a deficit China will be running this year. The outbreak was very disruptive already to its economy, and there is no guarantee that China will not have to deal with further waves of infection, even though currently it seems they brought it under control. We already know that petro-states such as Saudi Arabia and Russia will be running significant deficits, mostly due to the oil price collapse issue. It might not necessarily lead to a large increase in debt issuance, because many such states have large FX reserves on hand that they can rely on during times of distress. The EU, United States, Canada and other countries fighting to contain the virus by keeping as much of the population at home will most likely run huge deficits, given that they do not have massive FX reserves to rely on in times of need. Many companies will do the same.\n\nSource: CNBC.\n\nIn the middle of 2019 total global debt already surged to over $250 Trillion. Given a global economy of $86 trillion there was 2.9 times more debt outstanding than the total size of the world economy.\n\nThe $2 Trillion rescue package announced this week by the US government will add to the already large $1 Trillion deficit, making it a $3 Trillion deficit, before we factor in some secondary effects. When we factor in the likelihood that government revenues will most likely suffer a significant decline, it will be more like a $3.5-$4 Trillion deficit for the US federal government alone this year. This estimate is only relevant if we assume a happy case scenario where the virus will be contained by early summer and there will be no return of the virus this year. If the situation will be any worse than that, the deficit will increase further accordingly. It is impossible to predict the net increase in corporate, financial and other debt, but I am sure that it will also increase substantially, beyond what was expected before this crisis.\n\nBased on the information we have available out of Europe, many EU countries are also looking to run deficits as high as 15-20% this year. Spain announced a $220 billion stimulus package. Germany UK, Denmark, and others in Europe are announcing stimulus packages which are well above 10% of GDP. These measures, together with American initiatives are currently thought to add up to about $10 Trillion. I am certain that we will get additional rounds of stimulus all around the world as the situation at hand will dictate.\n\nI want to point out that I am by no means being critical of efforts made to keep the economy afloat, including companies and consumers. Some early signs out of China suggest the alternative could potentially be catastrophic for Western consumers. Consumer debt delinquency rates are now soaring in China. Leaving people to fend for themselves with no relief would not be a good idea by any means. The consumer spending segment makes up about 2/3 of the economy of most Western countries, so we cannot afford to allow its collapse.\n\nWhere sovereign defaults might start\n\nWhile I do not expect that there will be an imminent financial or monetary crisis in most major economies around the world, I do believe we will start seeing problems emerging among some of the fiscally weaker countries around the world and a crisis could spread up the pecking order.\n\nFor instance, since the start of the crisis Turkey's 10-year bond yield has been rising dramatically, reversing its earlier downward trend.\n\nSource: Investing.com.\n\nEven as yields on the US 10 year note have been cratering, as the example of Turkey highlights, some countries are seeing a rise in their borrowing costs making it a lot harder to keep their economies afloat through financial or monetary stimulus. They will have to push fiscal and monetary support through nevertheless. They will do it for as long as the markets will allow it.\n\nAs weaker entities will start defaulting, either officially or through currency devaluation the pressure of the markets will most likely shift towards the stronger sovereign debt issuers. The trend will be driven by growing default risk perceptions as more and more countries will renege on their debt obligations. The market will start asking that very dangerous question, namely; \"Who will be next\"? Several countries are seeing a very similar trend to what Turkey is experiencing in terms of their borrowing costs. Major sovereign debt issuers like Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, Egypt have all seen a spike in bond yields in the past few months. Such spikes can be just an early glimpse into things to come this year and there is no telling how far up the chain it could go.\n\nMonetary action could lead to hyperinflation this time around\n\nOne of the objections to the financial and monetary bailouts that were executed in America as well as the EU in response to the last financial crisis was the fear of hyperinflation. Just so we can understand why the objections were wrong at that time, and may not be wrong this time around, in other words, this time it can be different, we should have a review of what was done last time around and how it differs from current fiscal and monetary initiatives.\n\nIn response to a collapsing financial infrastructure, a massive bailout was introduced in 2008, supported by a huge expansion of The Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\n\nSource: Federalreserve.gov.\n\nThe increase in the Federal Reserve balance sheet worried many people because historically such expansion tends to lead to inflation. Because most of the money never found its way into the real economy but rather served to prop up financial institutions and other industry sectors within the economy, the fiscal stimulus and the on-going monetary loosening served to stimulate an impressive stock market rally. In other words it translated into inflation of sorts, but it was mostly confined to financial asset values. Actual consumer inflation remained low, given a slow wage growth environment, despite robust gains in employment.\n\nThe reason why this time around it could all be different is that the nature of the current stimulus bill which was passed is also much different. The money is not going to shoring up the balance sheets of financial institutions. If one looks at the details of the bill, it seems that most of the money is headed to the real economy. A big chunk of the bill will go directly to households, with most people eligible to receive up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, based on 2018 or 2019 tax data available to the IRS. $500 billion will go to v industry in the form of loans. Hospitals will get $100 billion in funds. Airlines will receive $58 billion in grants and loans. State & local governments will get $150 billion in funds. Unemployment checks will be topped up by $600 per week on top of regular benefits. The objective of the stimulus is to compensate entities for lost revenues and wages.\n\nThe money is going into the real economy, meaning that people, enterprises and local governments will be spending money they did not earn. At the same time, the value of goods and services being produced will be greatly reduced. It remains to be seen by exactly how much. Some estimates such as the one recently released by Goldman Sachs suggest that there could be a contraction of as much as 24% in the second quarter of this year. A strong rebound in economic output is also expected in the second half of the year, but this is not guaranteed, especially if the virus will not be fully contained, but rather it will continue circulating and pick up the pace of its spread as we start relaxing containment measures. If the virus will continue to linger, it will continue to disrupt economic activities until we will finally have a vaccine that will eradicate it. Some people optimistically hope that it might just disappear on its own. If it does not, we will be faced with the grim choice of extending economically unsustainable measures meant to slow down the spread of the virus or give up on containment and let the virus take its toll.\n\nEither way, the economic consequences will require further fiscal and monetary measures to avoid social breakdown. This in turn will lead to a massive imbalance in terms of goods and services produced on one hand and money available for spending in the real economy on the other. It is the classic hyperinflation scenario where more and more money will be chasing dwindling goods and services.\n\nInvestment implications\n\nWe are currently in the \"cash is king\" phase of this crisis when it comes to investments. If or when cash will start losing its buying power across the board, therefore its store of value function, investors will most likely scramble back into the market, which will experience inflation along with the real economy. With on-going disruptions to economic activities, it is hard to predict what will do well and what will not. While gold and silver did not have a stellar performance so far through this crisis, I think both metals will enjoy increasing investor interest as a form of insurance against a fiscal and monetary catastrophe, which I think is now more likely given the expansion in sovereign and other debts.\n\nThere is, of course, a strong possibility that we will manage to get past this crisis without any significant resulting financial damage. We are after all in uncharted territory, so there is simply no way of knowing for sure how this will all play out. The risk of this fiscal and monetary experiment blowing up and ushering in a massive crisis is now much higher than it was just a few months ago and probably much higher than it was in the 2008 crisis and we should not dismiss it, just because we also thought back in 2008 that a catastrophe was imminent and yet we managed to get through it. Many factors make this crisis very different. This is unprecedented in modern economic history, therefore investors should be cautious and remain vigilant.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The world of mobility is undergoing a profound transformation. Ride hailing, car sharing, car rental between people, peer-to-peer, micromobility solutions, such as scooters and bicycles, the development of self-driving cars and a multitude of investments in vehicles and solutions for transporting people and objects.\n\nWe are continuously seeking answering the questions about the future of our business in this changing environment. Our market has expanded conservatively, with car rental being one of the best responses to the demand of individuals and companies that are changing their habits and paying for use instead of ownership, bringing much more flexibility, comfort and economy for all of them. In this context, a new segment was born for app drivers, who have access to cars and maintenance of quality with flexibility of use to be more successful in their work. We once more were the pioneers in developing this new challenging segment, creating conditions that make economic return and quality possible in this segment, offering a partnership of value for Uber drivers and especially for passengers who wish to achieve their destination with comfort and safety. At the same time, we initiated significant investments in improving our customers' journey, offering greater convenience and access, using technology to move in that direction. The digital transformation has also allowed us to improve our operating excellence, redesigning processes, simplifying activities and allowing easier, faster and more efficient management.\n\nFurthermore, at this time of a lower demand for automakers, while the country is not growing vigorously, we have also been an excellent solution to stimulate car demand, so they do not lose scale. For the country, we made an expressive contribution with more than 10,000 direct jobs and the payment of BRL 691.5 million in taxes, net of tax credits, and approximately BRL 1.9 billion in tax incurred in the car purchases.\n\nThe result of our efforts in challenging our team to adapt to this new reality and the context of mobility was the company's performance in the recent years. In 4 years from 2015 to 2019, we saw our end-of-period fleet almost triple, going from roughly 125,000 to around 320,000 cars, an average growth of almost 30% per year for 4 straight years. The rental and fleet market grew, and we were able to take advantage of our strength to expand and consolidate our leadership. It is important to note that most of this growth came from the most efficient form of growth, which is organic growth. Thus, throughout this growth period, we managed to expand our already high levels of customer satisfaction and engagement. And lastly, it's also important to note that during this period, we maintained our strong value generation indicators.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, we added 4,329 employees to our staff. And for such circumstances, we invested heavily to preserve our culture of customer focus with a high-performance team building and determination in the search for results. We are very proud of the way our employees act. They think and act like business owners in an environment of hard work, but also that offers a lot of opportunity for professional and personal growth and fulfillment. The team engagement and motivation indicators are improving year after year, a result of our focus in developing leaders that inspire and transform. In this wave of changes in growth, we have also reinforced all our care and energy towards being a company committed to the community with high reputation. We invest and direct our team to care for the social, environmental, risk control, compliance and governance. We have a plural and respectful environment that takes care of diversity in an inclusive and healthy manner.\n\nAs for 2019, as you will see in the numbers and information disclosed here, we have grown fleet, revenue and results in the order of 30% year-over-year. The numbers speak for themselves. About our purpose, with you building the future of mobility, we're very excited with the receptiveness of our customers to the new solutions we are offering and that consolidates our leading role in market evolution.\n\nFor the future, we keep our humbleness in this certainty that everything we are doing can be done better and simpler. For this, as always, part of our margin is invested in building the skills of a future with a lot of entrepreneurial ambition and that will fulfill our purpose.\n\nWe would like to thank our over 10,000 employees, who make all of this happen and -- as well as our suppliers, business partners and investors, who trust and help us to grow and evolve always. A special thanks to our customers that, by choosing us every single day, give us the opportunity to enchant them with kindness, agility and the pleasure to serve.\n\nI'll now turn over to our CFO, Mauricio Teixeira.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMauricio Fernandes Teixeira, Localiza Rent a Car S.A. - CFO and IR Officer [3]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Good afternoon, everyone. It's with great pleasure that I'd like to share with you Localiza's 2019 results.\n\nBefore I begin, though, I would like to note that in addition to the adjustments of IFRS 16 that you are used to seeing, this quarter we started to account for the PIS and COFINS credits as a cost reducer and no longer as a tax reducer in revenues. There is no effect in gross revenue nor on EBITDA or EBIT or net income. However, it's important to highlight that the margins presented increase, as they are measured in relation to net revenues, which were lower. The reclassification was fully made in 4Q and the reconciliation of the new and the previous accounting is available in our earnings release.\n\nTo be comparable to the 2018 figures, we will present the percentage growth without the effect of IFRS 16 and without reclassification of PIS and COFINS. Nevertheless, the GAAP numbers will be presented in the webcast charts.\n\nMoving directly to Page 4. We can see the summary of Localiza's financial performance in 2019. Once again, we showed spectacular growth. The consolidated revenue increased by 33.7%, achieving the mark of BRL 10.5 billion, and EBITDA increased 29.3%, reaching over BRL 2 billion. Net profit achieved BRL 847.5 million, representing a new record.\n\nOn Page 5, we can see the operation highlights for 4Q '19. Rent a Car, or RAC, further accelerated its growth pace, with an increase of 38.4% in average rented fleet compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. In Fleet Rental, we also delivered strong growth with an increase of 26.6% in average rented fleet. Seminovos ended the quarter with a record sale of over 41,000 cars, delivering a growth of 28.1%. At the end of 2019, we achieved the mark of 323,000 cars in our fleet, growing both in RAC, Fleet Rental and the franchising business.\n\nOn Slide 6, we can see the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, net revenue grew approximately 35% and EBITDA grew 31%. EBIT increased approximately 17% due to the higher depreciation and the net profit grew 29%. We achieved the higher net profit obtained in a quarter by Localiza, BRL 234 million.\n\nTo present further details on 4Q results, I'll turn over to our Head of Investor Relations, Nora Lanari.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNora Mascarenhas Lanari, Localiza Rent a Car S.A. - IR Officer [4]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Good afternoon, everyone. To give you some more granularity on the quarterly and annual results, I would like to start from the Car Rental division.\n\nAs you can see on Page 7, in 2019, the average rented fleet increased by 32.4%, an increment of more than 31,000 rented cars on average in the year. Net revenue increased by 31.1% year-over-year.\n\nIn 4Q, revenue growth accelerated, increasing an expressive amount, 36.1% year-over-year, mainly due to the growth of approximately 42,000 cars, or 38.4%, in the average rented fleet.\n\nOn Slide 8, we can see that the average daily rate of BRL 72.2 in RAC reflects an increase in relation to 3Q '19 and a reduction compared to 4Q '18. The 3.2% reduction in relation to 4Q '18 is mainly due to the effect of the mix of segments in RAC, counterbalanced by an efficient yield management. The utilization rate of 4Q '19 was 79.1%, which represents a decrease of 2.1 percentage points year-over-year. This reduction reflects an adjustment in car purchases made between the third and fourth quarters to anticipate the peak season, keeping an adequate level of car availability in order to mitigate the risk of any impact in the quality of service provided in our branches in the high season. In the annual comparison, the utilization rate was kept at a healthy level above 79%.\n\nOn Page 8 (sic) [9], we can see that the network of corporate branches was extended by 26 units compared to the end of 2018. Of them, 21 are branches previously operated by franchisees. In addition, several branches have been expanded or renovated to increase their capacity and enable fleet expansion.\n\nMoving on to Slide 10. In Fleet Management division, the pace of growth also accelerated in the last quarter, with the average rented fleet increasing 26.6% and net revenue increasing 23% year-over-year. In this comparison, the daily rate fell by 2.8%, mainly reflecting the pricing of new contracts in the context of lower interest rates as already observed in recent periods.\n\nIn the year, the Fleet Rental division grew the average rented fleet by 25.3% and net revenue by 20.6%, which totaled over BRL 1 billion.\n\nMoving on to Slide 11. We can see the fleet purchase and sale. In the quarter, we bought 64,263 cars and sold 41,365 cars, an increase of almost 23,000 cars and the net investment of BRL 1.3 billion. In the year, the additions in the fleet exceeded 75,000 cars, substantially higher than the increase of approximately 54,000 cars in 2018. The 2019 net investment in fleet achieved almost BRL 2.5 billion with car purchases totaling BRL 10.3 billion.\n\nOn Slide 12, we show the Seminovos network in 4Q '19. As we had anticipated in our last earnings presentation, we opened 10 new stores. We surpassed the mark of 40,000 cars sold for the first time in a quarter, reaching a total of 41,365 units. We ended the year at 123 points of sale and 147,915 cars sold. It is important to note that despite the accelerated pace of store opening, the average number of cars sold per store increased during the year, reaffirming the strong sales capacity of our team.\n\nOn Slide 13, we showed the end-of-period fleet, which surpassed 323,000 cars, driven by Car Rental division, which grew 34% and Fleet Management, which grew 26.7%.\n\nMoving on to Page 14. We see that the consolidated net revenue for the quarter increased 35.1% when compared to 4Q '18. Net rental revenues increased 33% in the quarter, while Seminovos increased 36.7% due to the 28.1% growth in sales volume and 6.7% in average consolidated sales prices.\n\nIn the year, consolidated net revenue increased by 33.7% when compared to 2018. In 2019, net rental revenues increased by 28.4%, being 31.1% in the Car Rental division and 20.6% in the Fleet Management division.\n\nIn Seminovos, net revenue grew by 37.6% year-over-year due to the 32.9% growth in sales volume and 3.5% growth -- increase in the average price of cars sold.\n\nMoving on to Page 15. Consolidated EBITDA increased by 31.1% in 4Q '19 year-over-year as a result of the growth in the company's businesses divisions. EBITDA margin for RAC is in line with the margin of 4Q '18 when compared to the same basis. Fleet Management had a margin reduction of 2.2 percentage points, mainly due to the drop in the average tariff reflecting the lower level of interest rates.\n\nInvestments in IT and consulting have an impact on the RAC margins and Fleet Management in the short term, but are aimed at further developing the company's competitive advantages.\n\nSeminovos presented a margin of 1.4%, slightly higher than that observed in 4Q '18, which indicates that the depreciation adjustment throughout the year was adequate, so that the costs of vehicles sold remain close to the sales price of cars.\n\nCompared to 3Q '19, the Seminovos' EBITDA margin was impacted by the concentration of store openings. 10 new points of sale were opened in this last quarter of the year. In 2019, consolidated EBITDA, excluding the impacts of IFRS 16, exceeded BRL 2 billion, an increase of 29.3% when compared to 2018.\n\nOn Page 16, we show the evolution of depreciation. We see that in RAC, the average annual depreciation per car reached BRL 1,917.6, 89.4% higher than average depreciation in 2018. In the quarter, the depreciation was 86.3% higher year-over-year. In the Fleet Management division, the average annual depreciation per car was BRL 3,923.40, higher by 9% in relation to the average depreciation of 2018. As explained in 3Q '19, the increase in depreciation reflects the lower price level of new cars that impacts the pricing of used cars.\n\nOn Page 17, we can see that the consolidated EBIT in 4Q '19 reached BRL 405.3 million, representing a 16.7% growth compared to the same period last year due to the 31.1% increase in EBITDA, partially offset by the 80.1% increase in the cars and other fixed assets depreciation. The EBIT margin of the Car Rental division was 28.5%, representing a decrease of 5.4 percentage points compared to 4Q '18. In the Fleet Management division, the EBIT margin was 43.8%, a reduction of 1 percentage point compared to 4Q '18. The lower EBIT margin reflects -- mainly reflects the higher depreciation of cars. In 2018, the Car Rental's division EBIT margin was 29.9%, representing a drop of 3.3 percentage points year-over-year. In Fleet Management division, the EBIT margin for the year was 44.9%, a reduction of 3.7 percentage points in the same comparison.\n\nThe decrease in the interest rates allow for a lower EBIT margin with the spread ROIC minus the cost of debt maintained at healthy levels, which on the larger capital base results in an increase in the company's value generation.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter, on Page 18, grew 29% compared to 4Q '18. The expansion in net income is explained by the EBITDA growth of approximately BRL 140 million, combined with the reduction of financial expenses by approximately BRL 9 million, which were partially offset by an increase in depreciation of BRL 81 million and an increase in taxes on profits of approximately BRL 15 million. In 2019, the company showed a record net profit of BRL 847.5 million, representing a 28.6% increase year-over-year.\n\nOn Slide 19, we show the cash generation before the growth of BRL 1,255.5 million in 2019. The addition of approximately 75,600 cars to the fleet consumed approximately BRL 3.5 billion.\n\nAs can be seen on Page 20, investment in fleet growth was partially financed by our operating cash generation and the follow-on, but also impacted the net debt, which reached BRL 6.6 billion.\n\nI'd like to turn back over to Mauricio.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMauricio Fernandes Teixeira, Localiza Rent a Car S.A. - CFO and IR Officer [5]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you, Nora. As you can see on Page 21, we ended 2019 with a debt profile adequate to continue on this growth path. We also present the debt profile after some issuance and prepayments that we made in the beginning of 2020 that makes us even more comfortable to face this period of turbulence in the markets with a cash position of more than BRL 3.5 billion, and practically no payment amortization in 2020.\n\nOn 22 slide, we can see that the net debt over EBITDA closed the year at 3x, a level that we believe is efficient, considering our debt profile and low interest environment.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to highlight the evolution of the ROIC spread versus cost of debt that can be seen on Page 23. In 2019, we delivered the nominal spread a little lower than the previous year, but with a much larger invested capital base, resulting in increasing value generation for our shareholders. We maintain our objective of growing with profitability, and we will leverage our competitive advantages to capture market opportunities and continue the consolidation of the car rental market in Brazil.\n\nWe're now available to answer your questions.\n\n================================================================================\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [1]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Bruno Amorim from Goldman Sachs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBruno Amorim, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [2]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] If possible, I'd like you to comment about the exposure in airports. Considering that the demand in the aviation market, what is going to be like resulting from the coronavirus or COVID-19. So what's your elasticity in RAC demand if there's less traffic in airports? I believe that the main risk is in international traffic. That's where you would be more exposed. But if -- so if there is an impact to domestic air traffic, I'd like to know the impact for the company. And in that same line, are there any other products or lines that you can accelerate if -- so you're not affected by the airports if the in fact air traffic will be affected by that?\n\nAnd a second question. In terms of your potential for growth in RAC, you have a number of fronts to grow and they've been contributing to what you're delivering, but there's one that -- every now and then that grows more than the other. So what are your main initiatives for 2020? That would be great if we can hear some of that.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [3]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Bruno, thank you for your questions. That is the hot topic for the moment, right? So when we look at the indicators, up to February, no impact as a result of the coronavirus. In March, everything is normal, but we don't have that much time yet to feel an impact. When we look at our level of exposure, I think we can separate that into 3 scenarios. But the first one is what you mentioned. So inbound, foreigners coming to Brazil. That is -- doesn't really account on our basis. I'd say that less than 1% of RAC that comes from our foreign travelers that come to Brazil. And if there is an increase, sorry -- decrease of that traffic, there might be Brazilians traveling less abroad and more internally, so that could be an upside.\n\nThe second scenario. At the limit less leisure travel and less corporate travel could impact our revenues. But there's always the other side, which are the tourists that don't desist, but instead of that decide not to travel by plane and they decide to use a car to go to their final destination. So it's very hard to estimate the final impact on that. However, our revenues are less dependent on airports compared to what they were in the past. Obviously, some are still representative, but they did lose their representativeness, given the interest in new segments, as you've mentioned.\n\nSo to give you some flavor on that, moving forward, we believe that there's still a lot to grow in individuals regardless of the airports. Here, we're talking about frequency and habits of individuals renting cars, given more affordability. And the other driver is the ride hailing, that still has a very relevant growth potential. So when we add both of them, the economy coming back, let's see how the coronavirus will impact that.\n\nAnd lastly, the individual segment, more in the long term, that could also be worked on monthly rental and also annual rental. And just to set you at ease, we have a permanent committee monitoring the effects and impacts to the reserve -- to reservations, and so far, we haven't seen any effects.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBruno Amorim, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [4]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] A quick follow-up on that. The individuals product that you said that could be monthly or annual. What's the maturity plan for that? Is that product ready? Is -- I don't know, it is about kicking it off? Are you still testing it? It seems like there's a big potential there. Just so we can understand that and have some timing on that?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [5]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you, Bruno. We already have a product for individuals, it's the monthly. But we've been signaling that -- we're rethinking that product, not only in monthly, potentially annually -- or the annual version. We still don't have the final version ready. We started with some pilot projects, but we don't have anything that could be scaled up. Maybe second half of the year. We'll keep the market posted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [6]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Our next question is from Rogério Araújo from UBS.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRogério Araújo, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst [7]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] I'd like to talk about Seminovos. We had seen an increase in depreciation in the past quarter. And when we look at the purchase and sales spread of RAC, we see that quarter a marginal increase. We did have an increment in vehicle -- or an increase in vehicle depreciation. Could you talk about that driver, the driver for that new expectation in the Seminovos market? Is it already worsening in 1Q '20? Is that future expectation? Will you grow more, sell more cars? Could you give us some flavor on that?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMauricio Fernandes Teixeira, Localiza Rent a Car S.A. - CFO and IR Officer [8]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Good afternoon, Rogério. This is Mauricio speaking. We've seen this movement in depreciation in 4Q over 3Q at BRL 100. So if we do the math, it's a natural volatility. What we saw end of last year and beginning of this year, we saw very strong sales, record sales of 40,000 cars in 4Q, and this year sales started really strong. So it's natural and very small compared to the cars. Sales are still strong, even now in the beginning of 2020.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRogério Araújo, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst [9]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Okay, perfect. I imagine that you had mark-to-market in the last quarter, and this quarter could have had some sort of reduction in the depreciation level. But based on what I understood, you didn't. You already had an expectation of maintaining that level for the next quarters. Is that correct?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMauricio Fernandes Teixeira, Localiza Rent a Car S.A. - CFO and IR Officer [10]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Yes. It was a new level and the curve of depreciation inclination changed. When we say mark-to-market, it's a change in the inclination of the curve. It changed -- it didn't really change, it reduced. So let's see how the next quarters will behave. We still have a positive vision for 2020, even considering transferring automakers price in new cars, considering the exchange rate. But we have a lot of instability in the market right now in the news. And in practice, though, they haven't reflected on our business. So it's hard to give you, let's say, a perspective. There's a lot of things to come, the coronavirus, supply and demand, but so far, what we're seeing is a very positive scenario for 2020.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNora Mascarenhas Lanari, Localiza Rent a Car S.A. - IR Officer [11]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Rogério, this is Nora speaking to add. When we see the inclination of the depreciation curve throughout the third quarter, it was going up, especially in September or end of August when we had the news from Argentina. The -- it's reflected in the price of new cars and used cars. So the adjustment of depreciation was in September, and that changed how -- the curve. But remember that the change in the level of depreciation is divided by the rest of the useful life of the cars. So when they're close to the end, they have -- they're marked almost one-off, but the rest cars have a higher depreciation curve moving forward until they're sold. So you can say that in 4Q, it has already settled downwards, but not enough to change the quarterly average. So the adjustment in September was more relevant, in fact. All right?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRogério Araújo, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst [12]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Okay, very clear now. If you allow me a second question now about Fleet Rental. You had -- you've had an increase in the speed of that. Do you have contracts with smaller players or new players, so -- and a little bit about what you expect in terms of Fleet Rental for the next quarters -- upcoming quarters?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [13]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Good question, Rogério. I would say that that growth is the sales efficiency, and it's very disseminated. It's very spread out. So we've gained momentum in many different fronts. And what we believe, it's about a change in mindset. Instead of owning, it's about use. So I think that the general culture in Brazil is changing, and also in companies is changing. So you can see a very disseminated growth, spread out growth, and that's based on the efforts from our team in Fleet Management.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [14]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Our next question is from Victor Mizusaki from Bradesco BBI.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVictor Mizusaki, Banco Bradesco BBI S.A., Research Division - Research Analyst [15]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] I have 2 questions. The first one, to follow-up on Rogério's question about depreciation. I think it was in the beginning of November, where you had an event here in São Paulo, and you talked about depreciation. There was a slide where you showed the price dynamics for new cars. And then in September, new car prices were dropping a little, and you were marking that. So my doubt is even though it's a small decrease, BRL 100 per car in depreciation, and there was just a press conference given by ANFAVEA saying that with -- about the devaluation of the exchange rate, you can have an increase about BRL 2,500 in new cars. I'd like to understand why there would be another increase in depreciation. And in this first quarter, would you see -- in terms of the dynamics, is it going to stabilize, drop or is the depreciation per car going to increase?\n\nAnd my second question also related to the coronavirus. When we see what's happening in Asia and the Uber shares and Lyft shares, everybody is concerned with the risk of contamination, and they're starting to -- stopping to use ride-hailing services. So your exposure to ride-hailing today, how much -- what's the percentage of your fleet and RAC revenues account for that?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [16]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you for your question, Victor. First, about the prices of cars that reflect in Seminovos and depreciation. Even though there's a price increase -- signs of price increase, that's actually real. So if the exchange rate goes up, it should be reflected in the car price. We depreciate actually to what's happening in the market and not related to expectations, and we don't see that happening in new car prices. Therefore, it's not reflecting on the used car prices. So if new car prices go up, the historical trend is that used cars also go up and then depreciation will drop, and that's natural. But we will only lower depreciation if we actually see that in the list price, which we haven't seen yet. And if that happens, that is the phenomenon, the depreciation will drop.\n\nAbout the coronavirus. In the ride-hailing segment, we don't see that risk. And actually, that's an option instead of using public transportation, and public transportation is packed here in Brazil and people are all packed together. So I believe that the risk of contamination in the subway or in a bus during rush hour is much worse than riding -- than using ride hailing. So there are a number of different hypotheses for coronavirus. Actually, I believe that it would increase the demand in ride hailing because people won't want to share a packed environment with other people that could be contaminated, but these are hypotheses. We don't see this -- we haven't seen a coronavirus impact to our business yet, either positively or negatively. But I believe that the demand would increase for one driver and one car instead of sharing a bus with 70 other people.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [17]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] (Operator Instructions) Our next question is in English from Stephen Trent from Citi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStephen Trent, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Former Lead Analyst [18]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first one, if you could maybe provide a little color on the Car Rental segment? To refresh our memory, what portion of your demand comes from the corporate segment? And within that corporate segment, are you guys relatively diverse in your customer base? Or do you have a lot of corporate demand coming from big natural resource companies?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [19]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Well, Steve's question is about the corporate demand and how much it's concentrated or not. We don't break down the segments in Rent a Car, but the corporate segments are relevant. And I'd like to remind you that in the past years, given the recession, this segment, especially in the -- generally, it loses relevance and what gains relevance is individuals and the app drivers, but it's still a relevant segment, and especially in the corporate monthly, and not concentrated. We don't have concentration in one big customer or big industry, it's very fragmented. That's why we don't have much exposure risk to a specific industry or segment.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStephen Trent, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Former Lead Analyst [20]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGreat. Appreciate that. And on the Fleet Rental side, just out of curiosity. Maybe also trying to refresh our memory with respect to the turnover of those contracts, the relatively long-term contracts. So in other words, would the Fleet Rental segment be somewhat insulated from a short-term demand shock because of the long tenor of the contracts?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [21]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Exactly. See, Fleet Rental, we have average tenure of 30 months. So 2 to 3 years, most of them, 2.5 years. So it's -- I'd say it is insulated into -- compared to those short-term fluctuations.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [22]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Our next question is from Samir Patel from Merian.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSamir Patel, [23]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSorry, can you hear me? Hello? My question was just on the Seminovos division. Could you give an explanation of how much of your sales or used car sales are done through third-party points of sales?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [24]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Currently, approximately 46% of our sales are direct-to-end users and the rest to wholesalers as we call them.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSamir Patel, [25]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo 54% is wholesale. And also could you just clarify, in terms of the Seminovos stores that you have, what the potential capacity is there? Just to get a sense of the number of cars you're putting through the stores historically versus, say, whatever it was last year. Just to get a sense of what the throughput could be in the store level. And I appreciate that obviously the makeup of the stores can be quite different as well as geographies.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [26]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Exactly. If we do a math for total sales of the period divided by the average number of stores, we can see efficiency, approximately 115 cars sold on average per month per store. It goes up and down a little, but we've been able to gain productivity in that indicator. And that's why the -- that the SG&A for Seminovos over the sales revenue, they dropped from 9% to 10% to something close to 6%. So we've been able to gain efficiency and productivity in the Seminovos store. So said that, we're going to have to open more stores, so that we can renew the fleets in 2020. Therefore, in 2019, there were 16 new stores opened and that number of stores, new store openings should increase for 2020.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [27]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Our next question is from webcast. We've received the following question here. What do you think about automakers and dealerships going into the rental market?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [28]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] It's not a new phenomenon. Actually, we've seen that in the past, way back when, when Ford bought Hertz heard and Chrysler entered the business. In Brazil, we saw that some years ago, and usually, they come in and then they go out. It's just that they're testing the market. That's what it seems to us. I think it's normal competition. They have less scalability than us because they use, in the rental car, their dealerships, and they could eventually go into fleet rental, but these capabilities are completely different than what they currently have. It's like going from industrial to going into the services area. So we see this kind of movement, especially if there's a lower demand or repressed demand in the country for some years. So there are attempts that they're making. But we haven't seen a consistent case yet of them actually staying in the market in the long term, renting to individuals or even to corporates, in a successful RAC in the short term. We're monitoring that closely, but we don't have -- we don't see any major threats in that sense for us at this time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [29]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] We have another question from the webcast about the COVID-19 effect in the day-to-day rental. And in addition to that, what's the outlook for car prices in Brazil? And if it's reasonable to suppose that depreciation in RAC will continue to go up?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [30]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Well, let's split this question up. First of all, for -- about the COVID-19, we mentioned that in the beginning of the call. We have an exposure in airports. So at first, we believe that the international flow of tourism will decrease, but domestic tourism might even benefit from that. If there's more contamination, we believe that domestic travel could decrease. And in that sense, if the demand has a relevant drop, it's worth noting that our assets are flexible and easy to monetize. We experienced that in the recent past with the 2019 financial crisis (sic) [2009 financial crisis], where we closed -- or we stopped buying a little, but kept selling and adjusted the fleet according to demand. So Localiza has that room to do that. And if the case, we can reduce the fleet to maintain the utilization rate. Obviously, we would have less revenues. But on the other hand, as we did in 2009, there could be an opportunity for prepayment of part of the debt, which would in turn reduce financial expenses. A good example of that was 2019, no, 2009, sorry.\n\nAbout the car prices for 2020. If we consider ex coronavirus or COVID-19, we had a positive evolution of car prices that 2019 didn't follow inflation, and that it would at least follow inflation, go up new car prices, then Seminovos, your used cars and then depreciation would lower. With the impact of COVID-19 to the sales of the used cars, there's some uncertainty. People might say that there's a lower demand, but there's also a scenario that could be less supply, as a result of lack of parts at the automakers and less working hours in automakers. And there's the exchange rate, so Seminovos or used cars would be cars, so the price would go up, and then we would reduce depreciation faster.\n\nSo to summarize, if you ex COVID-19, we don't see depreciation going up. But even with COVID-19, we don't see these hypotheses in all the scenarios that we simulate. The depreciation would still drop.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [31]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] And a little bit more of color relating to car prices. I think it's worth noting that the exchange rate is affecting that, and on the other hand, or -- and also steel prices were adjusted. And in the beginning of the call, ANFAVEA, the association has signaled an increase of production cost about BRL 2,600 per car. So I believe that the automakers are suffering pressure to raise new car prices. And if that happens, used car prices will increase and depreciation will drop. So I'd say and that's the last part of the question here from the webcast. The depreciation trend is more prone to flattish with a gradual decrease. If new car prices go up, used cars will as well, and depreciation will fall faster, but we don't have the evidences of that, and Mauricio mentioned that. We don't see that price increase being transferred.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [32]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] We have another question here from the webcast. When only 39% of your revenues come from rental, isn't that dangerous a risk depending on sales of used cars?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnidentified Company Representative, [33]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Well, the fact is that Seminovos isn't an area of results. We don't have a profit in buying and selling cars. Quite on the contrary, for each car that we sell, we lose a little money. The objective of the Seminovos division is to reduce depreciation and renew the Localiza fleet. So the revenues we get from Seminovos division, that cash is used to buy new cars to replace the ones that we're selling. So it's not an area for company's results. Our results, our EBITDA, EBIT and profit come from Car Rental and Fleet Rental.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [34]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] (Operator Instructions) As we have no further questions, I'd like to hand over for Mr. Mauricio Teixeira for his final comments.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMauricio Fernandes Teixeira, Localiza Rent a Car S.A. - CFO and IR Officer [35]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you, everyone, for your presence, and our IR team is always available for any clarifications. Now I'd like to hand over to our CEO, Eugênio.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEugênio Pacelli Mattar, Localiza Rent a Car S.A. - CEO & Executive Director [36]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] On behalf of Localiza and everyone at Localiza, I'd like to thank you for your interest and participation in this conference call. All the care and the relationship that you have had with Localiza throughout all this time, I'd like to stress our satisfaction, and there were always concerns in being very transparent in our Investor Relations. And I'd also like to say that we are still excited about our business and also very cautious with any issues that may be caused by the COVID-19 in our activities here in Brazil. Thank you very much.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [37]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] The Localiza Rent a Car conference call is now over. Thank you for your participation, and have a great afternoon.\n\n[Portions of this transcript that are marked Interpreted were spoken by an interpreter present on the live call.]"

It may also have been the oldest form of a political confidence game used by leaders to exact tribute from constituents, older even than taxes, and inflation has kept those honored places in human affairs to this day... For four thousand years of recorded history, man has known inflation.\" - Jens O. Parsson, Dying of Money\n\nLife as we know it will never be the same. Travel, vacation, shopping, sports, social interaction will all change as we go forward and the threat of coronavirus recedes over time. We will not be going back to the way things were before the pandemic swept the globe. The pandemic has accelerated trends that were already in place before the breakout of the virus appeared on the global stage.\n\nSupply chains will be reoriented and become more local to the markets they serve. The risk of concentrating all manufacturing in one country like China has been exposed with severe consequences. Essential protective equipment is made in China along with a long list of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines, which presents a problem when all nations are seeking to obtain the same goods made in only one location. Online retailing will now accelerate at an even faster pace and many brick and mortar stores will disappear or morph into online retail in order to survive. There will be fewer stores and they will be smaller in size outside the big box stores who have already made the transition to online orders. Many of the country's shopping malls will simply disappear or be converted to other purposes. Think universities or trade schools.\n\nSocial interaction will also change. Large events such as basketball or football games may be watched more indoors along with musical concerts. Home gardening may come back in vogue. Restaurants may be more spacious inside, less crowded and do more business online and in takeout. Online education will accelerate and many brick and mortar schools may fail or apply for subsidies and a government bailout.\n\nSocial interactions will also change from public displays of affection, handshakes and hugs, to a kiss on the cheek. In person events will still be rare. Instead of asking \"Is there a reason to do this online?\" We'll be asking, \"Is there any good reason to do this in person?\"\n\nAs a society, we will become more skeptical and distrustful of the news and our leaders. The wearing of masks is a present example. First, we were told we shouldn't wear them as they were unnecessary - though extremely necessary for healthcare workers. If there is one piece of medical advice to protect yourself from COVID-19, it is to wear a mask when going out in public.\n\nThe coverage of COVID-19 by the media has been appalling and strewn with misinformation with an agenda far more interested in engendering panic than informing the public to echoing the sentiments of Chinese propaganda. How else can you explain the hoarding of toilet paper in defense of a respiratory disease? Just imagine media coverage of a gastrointestinal virus. The stores would have a run on nasal sprays.\n\nAnother change that will accelerate during the pandemic is the return of big government. Government powers will expand and become more intrusive in our lives, regulate much of what we are able to do, from business practices to social interaction. Just consider the power to shut down the economy from restaurants to bars, to being quarantined to our homes.\n\nWe are already seeing this in the extraordinary measures taken by the Federal Reserve mentioned in my last letter, to the recently passed $2.2 trillion stimulus bill. Stimulus is really the wrong word to use here as it is more of a measure to fill the vast hole blown through the economy by quarantine and business shutdowns. Congress is already working on another stimulus bill which may also involve trillions of new spending by the time we get to stimulus two and three. We have seen drastic edicts issued by governors to mayors threatening anyone that doesn't comply with arrest even as they release prisoners from jail. It is the consequence of this new expansion of power that I would like to address now.\n\nEven before the pandemic, the stage was set for vast amounts of new government spending programs. Prior to the pandemic, the economy was growing at a healthy clip and unemployment was at the lowest point in over six decades. Despite good economic numbers, the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 ending in September was coming in at over a trillion dollars. Now that deficit will be in the range of multiple trillions. The philosophical or academic justification for this is MMT (Modern Monetary Theory). The tenets of MMT are a government that issues its own money:\n\nCan pay for goods, services and financial assets without the need to collect taxes Can't be forced to default on debt denominated in its own currency Is only limited in money creation by inflation Can control demand-pull inflation by taxation and bond issuance Does not have to compete with the private sector for scarce savings by issuing bonds\n\nThis economic philosophy has been advocated by academics in universities that have no understanding of inflation and has now been embraced by both parties. Among all this talk about spending money, do you hear any talk or worry about deficits? There are no more deficit hawks and if there are, they're rare and hibernating.\n\nNow, let's move on to the inflationary aspects of how this unfolds. For that, some forbearance is necessary as a bit of background is required. To begin with, we are truly living in historical times. Interest rates have never been this low in 5,000 years of recorded human history.\n\nInterest rates were as high as 20% during Babylonian times, a brief period in the late 70s and early 80s but averaged between 3-6% throughout much of history. In times of war or during a period of inflation as under the Romans they got as high as 12%, but 3-6% was the average norm throughout the ages. Interest rates on sovereign debt are lower today than the depths of the financial crisis as shown in the table below.\n\nGlobal 10-Year Interest Rates\n\nSource: Bloomberg, as of 3/31/2020\n\nIt is not as bad for savers or investors in the U.S., but still pretty dismal if you are looking for income, and if you are looking to park cash, it will cost you money to do so with short-term T-Bills (last week 3- and 6-month T-Bills were negative).\n\nUS Treasury Yields\n\nSource: Bloomberg, as of 3/31/2020\n\nTo put this in perspective for those who are flocking into cash, if you put a million dollars into a three-month T-Bill you'll earn $640 of income on your million-dollar investment. A one-year bill will earn a measly $1,880 and a 10-year note $6,650.\n\nBy contrast, in the year 2000, you could have received anywhere between $60,000 and $65,000 in safe Treasury investments. During the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, I had our clients invested in sovereign bonds of Europe, Canada, and Australia earning 4-5% in interest. Today investments in France, Germany, and Switzerland are guaranteed to lose you money anywhere from 0.25-0.50% in contrast to the 4-5% returns I could get in 2000. Even before the financial crisis, it was possible to get 4-5% returns on Treasury securities - not anymore.\n\nSo why have interest rates fallen this low? Very simple, as shown in the two graphs from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. The nation's debt has been compounding and growing exponentially. Debt is now growing at levels faster than economic growth and at a faster pace than income. It is now necessary to keep interest rates muted and low in order to sustain debt or the whole financial system would implode.\n\nA final graph will put this into perspective of how far we have come since the recession of 1981 when interest rates peaked.\n\nAs debt compounds at a rate of multiple trillions per year, we will soon arrive at a national debt of $30 trillion. If interest rates were to normalize at historical rates between 5-6%, annual interest on that debt would run between $1.5-$1.8 trillion per year or roughly half of the government's annual budget. The government will deploy a strategy of financial repression - the artificial suppression of interest rates by the Federal Reserve - put in place after WWII when debt loads grew to 250-300% of GDP.\n\nBut that won't be the end of the story. A debt resolution will be necessary because this strategy won't work forever. Sovereign nations have three ways of resolving their debt issues:\n\nPay it down Default Inflate it away\n\nThroughout history, governments from Egyptian pharaohs, Roman emperors, kings, prime ministers, and presidents have chosen the inflation way out. President Roosevelt devalued the currency after confiscating gold from citizens before he devalued the dollar by raising the price of gold from $20 an ounce to $35 an ounce until President Nixon devalued the currency again in August of 1971 by removing gold backing of the greenback. The age of deficits and debt compounding in the U.S. had begun, and now it's in the process of accelerating.\n\nIn the not too distant future, an American president will have no other choice but to devalue the currency as a means of debt forbearance. He or she will have no choice. Interest payments will be too large, and taxes will not be sufficient to pay interest. It will be declared as a debt jubilee in the same way Nixon defaulted on gold backing of the dollar. At this point, a devaluation of the dollar is baked into the cake as it has not become a question of \"if\" but \"when.\" It is simply math at this point. You cannot have the level of debt growing at twice the rate of income and GDP growth. Mathematically that is impossible, so devaluation lies ahead in our future. One day you will wake up and it be will be done by executive fiat. The money you own in either cash or fixed investments will be worth half or one-quarter of their value than the day before. It will be that quick and sudden.\n\nI saw this firsthand in the early 1980s with Mexico. As the Fed began to aggressively cut interest rates in the US, I saw clients put their money in Mexican banks because they could obtain 30% interest on their CDs. Mexico's President, Miguel de La Madrid Hurtado devalued the currency overnight without warning and the value of those CDs in American dollars was immediately cut in half. That is the way devaluations occur. They come without warning and with immediate consequences.\n\nIf you would like to see what this might look like I highly recommend reading the book The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047, by New York Times best-selling author Lionel Shriver who I interviewed on our podcast September 17, 2016.\n\nNow let's move on to the inflation part. The inflation formula is as follows:\n\nMore money + fewer goods and services = inflation\n\nI will have more to say about this in future articles as I have dusted off my writing pen and will be returning again after a long absence from writing. Forgive the digression and back to the inflation stuff. We already know about the more money part as shown below. The Fed's balance sheet is growing exponentially and, at the present rate, will be ballooning to $10 trillion shortly as they backstopped just about everything from government deficits and bonds, to corporate debt and ETFs, money market funds, commercial paper, to direct loans to business. That is the money part.\n\nFederal Reserve Balance Sheet\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Financial Sense Wealth Management\n\nThe goods and services part is unfolding before our eyes as supply chain disruptions from China are already wreaking havoc with companies' abilities to produce goods from Apple to GM. The service industry has been furloughed and many businesses will go under and not return as a result of the virus shut down by government. Who will replace the workers who have been laid off, furloughed or simply not return? Many companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Target need to hire more than 500,000 workers but must now compete with unemployment insurance. If these companies want to compete, they will be forced to raise wages even higher which is inflationary.\n\nMany are wondering why there will be inflation now when it wasn't around in the last financial crisis with many of the same tactics in use. The difference is the monetization of fiscal policy. During the financial crisis, much of the money the Fed created remained on the balance sheet of the Fed, earning interest as banks rebuilt their balance sheets. The money did not enter the economy in the form of credit. It stayed at the Fed. Had it been lent out, it would have multiplied, creating more demand for goods and services which would have been inflationary.\n\nYou have heard that this economic recovery has been anemic both under the Trump and Obama administrations. The reason is that household debt was at historical levels and many families and individuals were unable to borrow during the early stages of the recovery. Most of them were leveraged to the hilt and upside down on their mortgages. The real inflation took place in financial assets which rose nearly 450%. Money poured into stocks and bonds and both inflated.\n\nThe price of gold is already sniffing out the inflationary wave that lies ahead. But first comes the whiff of deflation. In downturns, especially economic ones in the economy or financial markets, it creates a whiff of deflation as prices fall and the economy contracts as it's currently doing. Then comes the government response which is unfolding and is growing exponentially from both a fiscal and monetary perspective. The Fed issued multiple salvos from its monetary bazookas as highlighted in my last letter. We just got MOAB (the mother of all stimulus bombs), with a sequence of more bombs and helicopter money drops still to come.\n\nWhat does this mean for investors? There will be no sources of guaranteed income. T-Bill rates may go negative as they briefly did last week and as they have globally. Money market funds and CDs will drop to near zero. Bond yields will also drop unless you do what we're doing: waiting for panic selling and picking up bargains. We've done this in individual bonds, stocks and discounted ETFs. But as inflation picks up, it'll be necessary to switch over to hard assets and currencies if there are any left. This is what we did in the last decade when we rode the precious metals and commodity boom. It will return again as smart money leaves paper assets and shifts to hard assets. It is one reason we have returned to gold after a long hiatus since late 2011. This also means real estate, raw materials, agriculture and companies that have strong monopolistic pricing power, strong balance sheets, and competitive moats - as many of our dividend aristocrats in our portfolio do.\n\nI want to end with a graph of the devaluations and stock markets of Argentina to illustrate my point of what happens when a government devalues its currency. The stock market rises in the same terms of the inflation rates while the value of the currency falls. The following graph shows the stock market rising as much as the currency devalues. The graph below can be replicated in other countries that have devalued their currency as well from Brazil, Russia, and Turkey.\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Financial Sense Wealth Management. Indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Note: Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\nPerhaps no better example of this was the Weimar Germany inflation in the 1920s following WWI as shown in the graph below.\n\nThe rich and wealthy protect themselves from the forces of inflation by investing their wealth in stocks, real estate or their own companies (stocks like Amazon and Microsoft). Listed below are the top ten richest Americans.\n\nSource: Forbes.com\n\nLet us not forget our current president who made his fortune in real estate. I would challenge my readers to find anyone on the list of Forbes richest Americans who got there by investing in T-Bills, CDs, or money market funds.\n\nI will close with my favorite quote on inflation from the book Dying of Money, by Jens O. Parsson. Jens O. Parsson was his nom de plume as his real name was Ronald Marcks. I had the privilege of interviewing the author in August of 2013 after learning his real name.\n\nEveryone loves an early inflation. The effects at the beginning of an inflation are all good. There is steepened money expansion, rising government spending, increased government budget deficits, booming stock markets, and general prosperity, all in the midst of temporarily stable prices. Everyone benefits, and no one pays. That is the early part of the cycle. In the later inflation, on the other hand, the effects are all bad. The government may readily increase the money inflation in order to stave off the later effects, but the later effects patiently wait. In the terminal inflation, there is faltering prosperity, tightness of money, falling stock markets, rising taxes, still larger government deficits, and still roaring money expansion, now accompanied by soaring prices and the ineffectiveness of all traditional remedies. Everyone pays and no one benefits. That is the full cycle of every inflation.\" - Jens O. Parsson, Dying of Money\n\nI will have more to say about the inflation that's building up in the pipeline and is ready to catch the markets by surprise. Until then, stay safe and wear a mask, even a makeshift one when going out in public.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors"

Yet, so far, we have seen pretty much nothing but empty hospitals and ICUs across America and Europe which begs the question: What is really going on.\n\nAs I reported on Monday in a piece titled Some hospitals not so busy with COVID-19 cases as media portrays, others more so, several brave citizens ventured out to their local hospitals to see if they could find any signs of those allegedly infected with the deadly COVID-19 contagion and what they found may shock you to the core. Aginst everything the media has been reporting, at least several hospitals show no sign of the infected.\n\nWhy lockdowns worldwide?\n\nWhy is it necessary for all the inhabitants of the earth to be locked down in such a timely manner and have the lockdowns extend for a number of months forcing people to prepare and hoard much-needed food and supplies?\n\nCould there be something more to “the invisible enemy” as President Donald Trump would say then meets the eye?\n\nWhat if I told you that the same university that tracks the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide on a live interactive map is also the same university that diverts the trajectory of near-earth objects (NEO) asteroids away from the earth?\n\nLet me repeat, the very same university data that governments worldwide are basing their lockdowns off of is the very same university responsible for diverting asteroids away from earth. Now, do I have your attention?\n\nJohn Hopkins University & Medicine\n\nJohn Hopkins University & Medicine has been tracking the number of confirmed coronavirus cases on an interactive world map which the World Health Organization (WHO), along with pretty much every news outlet, and governments across the world have been using to make so-called educated decisions based on the spread of COVID-19.\n\nBut more importantly, John Hopkins University & Medicine is also the very same institution that partnered with National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) to divert NEO asteroids from hitting earth in a project called DART.\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the John Hopkins Physics Laboratory on Nov. 6, 2019: “The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) team building NASA’s first planetary defense test mission — the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) — has completed two key mission reviews that bring DART steps closer to the challenging task of diverting an asteroid.”\n\n“DART will be the first mission to demonstrate asteroid deflection using a kinetic impactor technique. This will involve autonomously piloting the APL-built spacecraft into an asteroid at roughly 4 miles (or about 6.5 kilometers) per second. The ultimate objective is to measure the resulting change in orbit of the small moon Didymos B around the primary asteroid, Didymos A. The asteroid system will be nearly 7 million miles (11 million kilometers) from Earth when DART arrives, and no threat to the planet, but its proximity makes it ideal for collecting ground-based observations before and after impact,” the press release states.\n\nMoreover, the statement says it’s “all systems go” in April of 2020 meaning that the project will “move forward.”\n\nAlthough those involved with the project claim the first mission won’t happen until July of 2021, some on the interwebs are still skeptical.\n\nThe following video posted to YouTube reveals how DART is expected to work.\n\nKeep in mind, DART has been touted in the media as Earth’s “last line of defense.”\n\nDoomsday Comet Atlas to arrive at peak of COVID-19 lockdown on April 29! What are the chances?\n\nIt’s mainstream news that Comet Atlas is 5 times the size of Jupiter and “is getting a tail” as it becomes visible in the night sky upon it’s a close approach to earth on April 29 which is also coincidentally will be around the “peak” of the COVID-19 lockdown, as President Trump claims.\n\nThe bright comet is “currently visible through binoculars and telescopes as it travels through the northern circumpolar constellations of Ursa Major (the Big Dipper/Plough) and Camelopardalis (the Giraffe), Comet Atlas—officially known as C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)—appears to be getting a tail,” as reported by Forbes on Wednesday.\n\n#Comet ATLAS on March 29th. https://t.co/QaTWFWcA0w A tail is starting to develop.

The event was widely felt, with close to 16,000 ‘Did You Feel It?’ reports thus far submitted, but likely to have low impact.”\n\nIt is also important to note that Salt Lake City was hit by a rare magnitude 6.3 earthquake on March 18 which also had not happened in 50 years. The earthquake was so powerful that it knocked out power to 73,000 residents.\n\nAdditionally, a record number of earthquakes were reported in Yellowstone in the month of February.\n\nA total of 222 seismic disturbances were reported in February which may be cause for concern.\n\nSecret government contracts to house displaced citizens during a national disaster exist and were exposed by Intellihub in 2014 report: Brazil, Argentina and Australia sign contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars to house displaced U.S. populace when Yellowstone supervolcano erupts\n\nAccording to the report, “Contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars presented to at least 4 countries will run from 2014-2024, a 10-year span, in which the Yellowstone supervolcano is expected to erupt, devastating a large portion of the U.S.”\n\nFrom Intellihub:\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC) recently turned down a $10B a year disaster management plan offered by the United States to house American citizens who may become displaced in the event that the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts.\n\nThe U.S. plan for relocation was formulated after a recent scientific analysis of the park revealed that Yellowstone’s supervolcano has the potential to violently erupt within the next 10-years as noted by others including the famous astrophysicist Michio Kaku.\n\nIn fact, Praag, a Pakistani publication, recently reported:\n\nIt may take up to ten years for pressure in the magma chamber of the super volcano to build. According to Dr. Jean-Philippe Perrillat of the National Centre for Scientific Research in Grenoble, France, “it is the difference in density between the molten magma in the caldera and the surrounding rock big enough for the magma from the chamber to the surface to increase “. “The effect is the same as the extra buoyancy of a soccer ball under water fill with air, after which it rises to the surface because the surrounding water poet,” said dr. Perrillat. “If the magma volume is large enough, it should go to the surface to rise and explode like a champagne bottle that ontkurk be.” According to Dr. Sipho Mathetwe, the South African government “sympathy for the American challenge (challenge) to Yellowstone, but we have our own challenges in South Africa. There are 200 million white people in America, and if too many of them to South Africa flights, it is a big problem, even though there is enough housing and infrastructure available. It will destabilize the country and may even bring back apartheid. South Africa is not for sale.”\n\nHowever, according to the report, “Brazil, Argentina and Australia” jumped on the bandwagon, accepting the request from Washington.\n\nShockingly, this all comes at a time when wild animals have been reported to be fleeing the park from seismic vibrations.\n\nIt has also been reported that earthquake swarms in the area have become more rampant.\n\nIn a previous article I reported:\n\nRecent reports suggest that ancient Helium4 gas has breached the surface layers of Yellowstone’s crust,escaping into the atmosphere. Now couple that with the recent and abrupt ground level rise in the park–and we may be looking at a spell for disaster. I mean after all, as Michio Kaku, famous theoretical physicist, pointed out on a Jan. 2011 CNN newscast, “When it blows [Yellowstone] it could destroy the United States as we know it. […] That’s what is making us nervous” I don’t know about you but to me the thought of living in that region is horrifying, but what do I know, I live right near a massive volcano myself in Hawaii. Later in the newscast the popular physicist points out how a 1000-mile ring of the U.S. would likely be destroyed if the supervolcano actually went. And as scary as that seems to some, we are actually quite overdue for the big one. In fact, the last Yellowstone eruption was thought to have happened around 630,000-years ago, meaning we are 30,000-years overdue for a total explosion.\n\nA war or extinction-level event (ELE) is coming, here’s why…\n\nFrom Natural News:\n\nBy now, you know that I was more than a month ahead of virtually all media — independent and mainstream — in warning about the coming coronavirus pandemic. When I first released projections of 10,000 deaths in America by May 10th, nearly everyone thought the idea was insane (probably including you). As it turns out, we are likely to have over 100,000 deaths by May 10th, according to what the White House is now saying. This is worth mentioning because today we have a new warning about where things are headed. There have been three unmistakable signs that war is coming to the United States very soon. Those signs have all emerged in the past week, all with a sense of urgency that goes far beyond any concern about a pandemic: Sign #1) President Trump activating one million military reservists with medical skills to treat battlefield injuries. Details of this order are found in the EO text at WhiteHouse.gov. Sign #2) The Pentagon ordering high-level staffers into deep underground bunkers in Colorado. This was announced by NORAD and NORTHCOM in a Facebook town hall meeting. Obviously, you don’t order military staffers into a 2,000-foot deep bunker just because of a virus. Sign #3) Secretary of State Pompeo just ordered all Americans living overseas to return to the US “immediately.” The cover story for this is that the coronavirus is collapsing international flights. But that alone would not justify all Americans returning from living overseas, since many Americans would just hunker down where they’re living. But Pompeo wants all Americans to return immediately, which is the kind of thing you do before a war breaks out (with China, most likely). Via The UK Independent: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Americans abroad who still wish to return to the United States to do so “immediately,” saying commercial and government-chartered flights could soon cease amid the coronavirus outbreak. Donald Trump’s top diplomat urged any Americans abroad who want to get back to US soil to contact the American embassy in the country where they currently are to begin making plans “immediately” to get a flight back to the States. That’s because Pompeo doesn’t want to end up negotiating for the release of American prisoners being held by the communist Chinese regime, obviously. Any American reading this who is still in China or Hong Kong should strongly consider bugging out. By the way, we were also told weeks ago from another source that China has already begun executing anti-communist leaders in Hong Kong, which now seems to be preparation for the global war that’s about to happen next. These three events are unmistakable signs that high-level officials within the Pentagon and US State Department anticipate actions of war in the very near future. China is the most likely adversary, especially given that China probably released the Wuhan coronavirus in the first place, knowing that America would have a much more difficult time locking down cities compared to China itself, which we now believe may have lost millions of citizens despite its best efforts to contain the virus. Notably, the Wuhan coronavirus, released by China, has managed to cripple the US Navy by infecting sailors on aircraft carriers and other vessels. This is not an accident. It’s part of the “softening up” phase to weaken America in advance of the attack. Expect an attack on America when the nation reaches “peak pandemic” health chaos and economic disruptions The ideal time for a foreign enemy to attack the United States would be when our nation is in the throes of economic collapse and a pandemic medical emergency. According to estimates announced by the White House today, coronavirus-related deaths will peak in the USA on April 12th, but lockdowns will continue through the end of April, causing financial reverberations to echo across the nation for many months yet to come. The White House currently expects up to 240,000 Americans to die from the coronavirus over the next several months. (Our own estimates top out at just 90,000 fatalities, by the way.) Due to the coronavirus crunch, joblessness, homelessness and rising social unrest will sow chaos across the landscape of America for the remainder of the year (and well into 2021), and that doesn’t even count whatever political chaos might be added to the mix surrounding the coming November elections. Plus, there are food shortages that are starting to become very real, while a massive wave of price inflation for consumer goods will appear soon thanks to the trillions of dollars in bailout money that Trump and the Fed just threw at the economy. With one-third of the US Congress now run by communist China — and most of the left-wing media making excuses for China and trying to shift the coronavirus blame to Trump — it’s clear that China’s longstanding desire to infiltrate and destroy the United States of America has reached a tipping point. They will likely pull the trigger soon, which could mean economic warfare (selling all US debt and announcing a new gold-backed world reserve currency), kinetic warfare (an actual land invasion of Chinese troops hitting the beaches in California), nuclear warfare (or an EMP weapon detonated above North America), or even new waves of biological warfare (SARS-cov-3, SARS-cov-4, etc.). And don’t forget cyber warfare, a favorite of the tech-savvy communist regime. We don’t know exactly what’s coming, but we know the leadership in America believes something big is about to happen. Otherwise, none of the actions listed above would have been taken. Ramp up your preparedness to a whole new level, if you can Prepare for all the following, just in case one or more happen: A loss of the power grid\n\nA blackout of all internet and phone communications\n\nForeign troops invading the US, including through the Mexico border\n\nAttempted assassination of President Trump, or a possible “civil war” inside the Pentagon\n\nThe possibility of mass arrests of deep state traitors who are Chinese collaborators, such as Sen. Feinstein, Gov. Newsom, etc. We cannot be certain that any of these will happen, and we hope none of them do. But there are giant red flashing warning signs just screaming out that something big is about to go down. The only two scenarios that make sense are a WAR with a foreign enemy or possibly the initiation of a domestic civil war (or perhaps both).\n\nMass graves being dug for American citizens! Happening now!\n\nVia The Intercept:\n\nNew York City is offering prisoners at Rikers Island jail $6 per hour — a fortune by prison labor standards — and personal protective equipment if they agree to help dig mass graves on Hart Island, according to sources with knowledge of the offer. Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed the general arrangement, but said that it was not “Covid-specific,” noting that prisoners have been digging graves on Hart Island for years.\n\nMass graves were already prepared for all American citizens back in 2009\n\nMy original report appeared on Infowars.com and can be viewed here.\n\nFrom Infowars:\n\nA usually quiet U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Cemetery has been extremely active, with trucks and construction equipment working throughout the night. The National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona is a beautiful 225-acre facility located in Phoenix. For the past 30-45 days in the early hours of the morning until sunset, a massive construction operation has been underway. Major amounts of earth have been excavated out about 9-10 feet deep and 600-1000 feet wide. There are multiple locations on the property like this. From the satellite view, there appear to be even more sections that have been covered with the concrete lids and backfilled to look as if nothing is there. ABC rock is put in place under the burial vaults for good drainage and solid bedding. This will help keep groundwater sources uncontaminated from the decomposition of human bodies. The cleanliness of the heavy equipment operation and the large perfect cuts of the earth is impressive. These Massive concrete boxes were transported from a nearby storage yard on various privately owned flatbed semi-trucks unloaded and put into place a half-mile away at the actual mass gravesite. They were installed tight together, side by side with no space in between. An interview was conducted between my friend and a truck driver involved in the operation. After beating around the bush for about ten minutes, the driver admitted: “I got paid a whole lot of money to speak good English.”\n\nPentagon seeking 100,000 body bags for civilians\n\nFrom Bloomberg:\n\nThe Pentagon is seeking to provide as many as 100,000 military-style body bags for potential civilian use as the U.S. warns that deaths could soar in the coming weeks from the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has requested 100,000 body bags, known as Human Remains Pouches, through an interagency group that directed it to the Defense Department. The Pentagon is looking into buying more bags and will draw some initially from a stockpile of 50,000 it maintains, according to two people familiar with the request.\n\nH/T: @BpaulNs on Twitter\n\nRelated: ’1000 mile swath of the U.S. may be destroyed within 2 weeks from an extinction-level event’, says park geologist\n\nCan you think of a better reason for worldwide lockdowns?

Welcome to Light's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today with us, we have Mrs. Ana Marta Veloso, CEO; and Mr. Roberto Barroso, CFO; and all other executives in the company. Today's live webcast and presentation may be accessed through IR website. We would like to inform that this event is recorded. (Operator Instructions)\n\nBefore proceeding, let me mention the forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Light management and on information currently available to the company. They involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to the future events and therefore, depend on circumstances that may or may not occur. Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of Light and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow I'll turn the conference over to Mrs. Ana Marta, who will begin the conference. Please, you may proceed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAna Marta Horta Veloso, Light S.A. - CEO, Chief Business Development & IR Officer [2]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGood afternoon. I'd like to thank everyone who is taking part in our conference on the 2019 fourth quarter results. We ended last year with concrete advance in our value creation agenda, and these results will become clearer as we progress in 2020. In July, we completed a follow-on equity offering, which was, in fact, a reprivatization of Light. Today, we are indeed a true corporation. We are making progress with a professional and aligned team on the agenda of generating value and improving governance that we announced to the market. And we are also on the right path of generating sustainable results, building a consistent way to become one of Brazil's best energy companies despite the complexity of our concession areas.\n\nAn important event during past year, which occurred in August, reached the final decision in the court, the judicial process related to the exclusion of VAT tax from the PIS/COFINS calculation basis. As a result, we recognized the gains related to this decision in the third quarter based on legal opinion and current legislation. We are still in understanding with ANEEL to construct an acceptable and balanced solution. We expect that the matter will be submitted for public consultation by the regulator is still during the first half of this year.\n\nOn the March 12 this year, Light enrolled the tax credit in the Brazilian internal revenue service in the amount of around BRL 6.2 billion, which we believe belongs in part to Light and in part should be passed on to our customers. In October, we completed the sale of our interest in Renova, releasing our management team to focus even more on the turnaround of the distribution, which as has been widely disclosed to the market is focused on 4 main initiatives: combating energy losses, reducing the digital contingencies, reducing PMSO and prioritizing CapEx and liability management. We also continued with our strategy of divesting noncore assets in companies, which we do not control such as Belo Monte, Guanhães and Paracambi.\n\nIn this quarter, the second quarter under the new management team, we managed to reverse the worsening trend in operational indicators such as energy losses, contingencies and manageable costs and achieved substantial improvements in some of them, such as the distribution PMSO.\n\nRecurring consolidated EBITDA reached BRL 464 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% over the fourth quarter 2018. In the year, recurring consolidated EBITDA reached approximately BRL 1.7 billion, in line with the previous year. These results exclude nonrecurring items, such as the recording of PIS/COFINS and Renova's PDD, which applied to the third quarter and exceptional PDD reported in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the front line of the fight against nontechnical loss, this was another quarter of stable loss, in which the upward trajectory of the first semester has been halted. We began forming the team responsible for conducting energy test in July, with important changes made to the leadership and field teams. We carried out training and qualification of teams. We changed the way we retain services. We hired third-party employees in order to improve ethical control and increase productivity and realign the remuneration of our process team to the effective generation of results for the company.\n\nWe divided our action plan by regional areas after detailed diagnosis of the realities of the problems in each one. Each regional area now has a service management center, which performs real-time monitoring of field activity, ensuring greater agility and assertiveness in decision-making. We have been relentless with the highest income customers who steal energy, whether commercial or residential, by carrying out inspections, checks, many of them with the support of the police and reported in the media while working tirelessly to bring and maintain our customers in their formalities, paying regularly their energy bill.\n\nWe have been working also in the administrative tier of nontechnical losses, correcting measurement years and analyzing billed customers by the mean and minimal measures. We are carrying out CapEx by exchanging old meters of average over -- average age over 45 years of service, shielding the network by both customers in more aggressive areas and also investing in managing specifically where energy losses are located. As a result, total losses over the grid load ended the year at 26.05% compared to 25.93% in the third quarter of 2019, remaining practically stable as in the previous quarter.\n\nThis is an important reversal of trend, since the total loss grew up by around 10% in the first semester of the last year compared to the end of 2018. Considering the 12-month total loss volume without ramp in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of the previous year, we are already seeing a reduction of 105 gigawatt hours, more than double the reduction presented in the third quarter 2019. The number was 52-gigawatt hour at that time, which signals a trend reversal for an indicator.\n\nAnother indicator that confirms the trend of improvement in nontechnical loss is the one that manages noncommercial losses, excluding ramp, compared to the low-voltage market. We had a reduction of 1 percentage point in the last quarter of last year when compared to September 2019. This is the first time in the last 2 years that we have recorded a significant reduction in 1 quarter. We know that sustainable loss reduction is the most important initiative of our turnaround plan, and we are convinced that we are on the right path. We are currently 6.4 percentage points above the regulatory recognition in the tariff of 19.62%, according to the parameters adjusted in the tariff adjustment of March 2019.\n\nOn the collection side, we are maintaining the use of collection instruments such as SMS, power cutoff and negative appointments in client risk report, seeking to keep the PDD well under control while, at the same time, moving forward in combating loss. The accumulated collection rate for the year remains high, having reached 19.6% of the total revenues that were charged in line with the last quarter. All sectors, including public powers, have shown good performance.\n\nIn this quarter, after extensive evaluation of our accounts receivable and taking into account the expectation of future collection of outstanding balance, we decided to establish a nonrecurring and exceptional PDD of BRL 525 million. In December, excluding the provision related to the revaluation of accounts receivable, the PDD closed at 1.9% of the total revenues in line with what we have reported in recent quarters.\n\nIt is expected that with the incorporation of customers who are now informal and with the drop in losses, this indicator will show some increase in the coming quarter. We are also improving relationship customer management in order to reduce contingency, which reached BRL 392 million last year, excluding the program for voluntary businesses. We carefully reviewed our customer relationship front, call centers, ombudsmen and stores as well as improved the internal process to improve service and thus prevent new lawsuits from being filed. And our legal department is even closer to the regional branches in order to act together with the commercial areas as the causes of contingency.\n\nAs a result, we are already managing to reduce the filing of new lawsuits, which will be reflected in a reduction of contingencies in the coming quarters. At the special field report, also known here in Brazil as DEC, where over 45% of contingencies are filed in terms of value, we saw a 20% reductions in new losses compared to the same period from last year. There was also a reduction in the number of complaints filed at our stores, call centers, with our ombudsmen and with ANEEL. These indicators serve as important leading trends for contingencies and reinforce our belief that legal contingencies will be reduced in the following quarters.\n\nToday, our PMSO expenses in Light SESA are close to what is included in our tariff. However, we aim for further reduction. We have been working on several fronts in the control of PMSO, better management of materials and contracts with third parties, the launch of a voluntary dismissal program, increasing synergies in the distribution operations, higher productivity of field teams, among others. As a result, the manageable cost of Light SESA this quarter was 7.3% lower than in the same quarter last year, maintaining the downward trend from the third quarter of 2019. We are also progressing with the change in internal culture to assess our ownership of a private-owned company aimed at achieving results, value employees based on meritocracy, safety and ethics, following the example of the most efficient distributors in the country.\n\nTalking about financial aspects. Now the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of Light SESA -- of Light S.A., the holding company, sorry, remained stable at 2.98x, below the limit of covenants, reached 3.75x established in the most of our debt contracts. Light's consolidated net debt ended the fourth quarter of 2019 at BRL 6.7 billion, BRL 1.2 billion less than 2018, enjoying a healthy cash position of BRL 1.7 billion that is sufficient for the debt that is coming through the due time in the year of 2020. This reduction was made possible through the primary offering of more than BRL 1.8 billion from the follow-on that took place last July, which strengthened the company cash position and also supported our liability management strategy.\n\nIn this sense, our financial department, under the leadership of Roberto Barroso, is conducting a series of initiatives, plans and targets to improve Light's debt profile and debt cost. Among those, I would like to highlight the transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2019: our redemption of 35% of bonds issued by Light SESA and Light Energia in the total amount of $210 million, early amortization of Light SESA's loan with BNDES in the amount of approximately BRL 293 million and value of BRL 1.0 billion in funds with the issuance of debentures and promissory notes by Light SESA.\n\nRegarding quality indicators, the DEC and FEC, Light continues to deliver excellent results, ranking among Brazil's 6 best companies despite the complexity of our concession area. In the year of 2019, DEC was 7.77 hours and FEC was 4.31x. As we expected, we complied with the regulatory limit for the year. This March, Tuesday, this 10 of March, Tuesday, ANEEL approved the annual adjustment of Light SESA's tariff will be applied as of the 15. The average increase to customers will be 6.21%, and the most relevant point of the adjustments were 2.45% reduction in sectorial charges due to the end of payment of the CDE ACR account; 2.79% rise in the cost of energy purchases, especially of the contracts with Itaipu and Norte Fluminense, which are pegged to the dollar; 4.11% increase in financial items; and the adjustments of Parcel B, which covers the cost and pay for Light's CapEx was settled at 4.53% above the inflation record in the period of 3.94%. Additionally, this week, ANEEL approved the new regulatory work, which will take effect for Light as of the next tariff review that will take place in March 2022. The value for 2019 was settled at 7.78% compared to the 7.17% initially disclosed by the regulator.\n\nIn the generation segment, the results remained solid and exceeded those of last year. The weekly monitoring of the exposure to the GSF allows a better strategy in the purchase of energy in the free market to mitigate the hydrological risk. The EBITDA was BRL 109 million in the fourth quarter, which was BRL 26 million over the same period last year. In the year, the generation EBITDA closed at BRL 542 million, contributing to the consolidated results significantly, with an increase of more than 40% when compared to 2018. It's important to update the market regarding the progress in the GSF issue. This March 10, Tuesday, the Senate's Economic Affairs Committee passed the Bill 3975. And under the terms of this view, generation companies will have to repay their debt to the CCEE. And once this process is passed by the Senate plenary and regulated by ANEEL, and that concept -- the concession of these generations will be extended for up to 25 months.\n\nNow I'd like to give the floor to Barroso, our CFO, who will present our results in the fourth quarter of 2019 in greater detail. Please, Barroso.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoberto Caixeta Barroso, Light S.A. - Chief Financial and Business Development Officer & Member of Board of Executive Officer [3]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks, Ana Marta. Good afternoon. Going to the Slide #2 in the presentation, we saw a decrease in the grid load in the fourth quarter of 2019, 1.6%. And also, we saw a decrease in the billed market of 2.2% in this last quarter of 2019 comparing with the last quarter of 2018. But when we exclude the REN billed in both quarters, we saw a decrease of 0.7% in this quarter, which means that the losses reduced in the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding REN.\n\nGoing to the Slide #3. We can see a stable total loss for the second consecutive quarter of 2019. We saw, as Ana Marta said, an increase of almost 10% in the total losses in the first semester of 2019. And now this total losses almost is stable. We saw, excluding REN, a reduction of 52 gigawatt hours in the third quarter of 2019. And now we saw a 105-gigawatt reduction in the losses in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the same period of last year. Looking in the second graph in this third slide, we saw also a reduction of 1 percentage point in the evolution of nontechnical losses over the low voltage market, sorry.\n\nGoing to the Slide #4. We saw a reduction of the REN billed in the last 12 months to 209 gigawatts in 2019. And also, we see an increase of incorporation of energy quarter after quarter. We saw the fourth quarter of incorporation of energy. The amount of incorporation of energy was 186 gigawatt hours, which means that we are focused on incorporation of energy for the next year in order to reduce the REN volume to view in the next year. Looking for the collection rate, we finished the year of 2019 at the same level we finished the last year. But as Ana Marta told us, we reevaluate the receivables by the fourth quarter of 2019, and we increase the recognition of allowance for that to account in the total amount of BRL 525 million, one off in the fourth quarter of 2019 and as a nonrecurring item. So the total number of PECLD over [raw-based] index, we closed in the total amount of 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019, the same level we disclosed in the previous quarters.\n\nIn the Slide #5, we can see the quality indicators. We finished the year of 2019 with the DEC at the same level of last year, 7.77x -- hours, 5% under the limit defined by the regulator. And the FEC, we also closed the year very well, 25% under the limit of the regulator.\n\nTurning to the Slide #6. We increased almost 8% in our recurring consolidated EBITDA, which means BRL 34 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. And it's important to mention that we were able to reduce almost 8% in the PMSO, the manageable costs in the second half of 2019. We reduced almost 8% in the third quarter and also almost 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nTurning to the Slide #7. We -- also, we can see a reduction in the new lawsuits against of the -- against to the company, in a lot of areas of the company, in call centers, in Light stores, also in the ombudsmen and complaints against Light in the ANEEL. We saw the number of contingent suits against the company in the fourth quarter of 2019, very similar with the numbers we disclosed in the fourth quarter of '18.\n\nGoing to the Slide #8. We also disclosed our recurring EBITDA comparing by segment. We saw a reduction in the segment of this distribution but mainly related to the nonrecurring items. When we exclude the nonrecurring items, we can see an increase in the recurring EBITDA from the distribution company in the amount of BRL 35 million, very similar with the increase as Ana Marta told us in the generation business. And as well, we can see a small reduction in the recurring EBITDA from the commercial business, mainly related with 1 specific gain we discussed in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nGoing to the Slide #9. We saw the total result of Light, and we saw a decrease in the results mainly related to the market-to-market of the swaps we have in the dollar that we had when we issued this debt and also with the cost of the prepayment we did in the fourth quarter of 2019, considering Light prepaid the most expense debt in the last quarter in order to reduce the amounts to pay off cost of the debt for the next year.\n\nGoing to the last Slide #10, we saw the position of our debt and as well the cash position. We closed the year of 2019 with almost BRL 1.7 billion in cash position, BRL 400 million over the portfolio of maturities of 2020. And as Ana Marta told us, we were able to issue almost BRL 1 billion in new debt for the fourth quarter of 2019, and we continue monitoring the market and discussing with local banks to issue and hire new debt in order to continue our liability management, extending our debt and trying to reduce the cost of the debt of the company.\n\nNow we can complete the presentation, and we're available for the Q&A session. Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [4]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Operator Instructions) I'll turn over to Mrs. Ana Marta for closing remarks.
