(Bloomberg) — The Nobel Prize-winning scientist whose research proved critical in developing lithium-ion batteries said the ubiquitous technology energizing iPhones and Teslas is poised to become more powerful and cheaper — keys for unlocking the mainstream adoption of electric vehicles and home-energy storage units.
M. Stanley Whittingham, 77, is part of a trio jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry this month. He still works to make batteries better, more than four decades after his initial breakthroughs in a New Jersey laboratory while employed by Exxon Mobil Corp., where he received the patent for a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.
“They are going to become cheaper and more readily available to everyone, and the research we’re doing will increase the energy density and make them safer at the same time,” Whittingham, a professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton, said Wednesday in an interview in Sydney.
Further improvements to the technology may also bolster efforts to combat climate change by enabling greater use of renewable-energy sources, Whittingham said. His outlook may offer comfort to automakers and utilities currently grappling with weaker EV sales in China, the top market, and safety setbacks in the deployment of grid-scale batteries.
The following excerpts from the interview have been condensed and edited.
How can battery technology improve?
Whittingham: What we are now looking at is increasing the energy density — twice as much in a given weight or volume, cutting the price and also seeing it really get into all devices, so we’ll have cleaner cities and we’ll have more electric vehicles in the cities.
What would better technology mean for electric cars?
Whittingham: It’ll allow cars to go farther, but perhaps more importantly it’ll allow batteries to be smaller. If we can put twice the energy in the same volume, then we can make batteries much smaller than they are today. You use less material, so they’d be less costly, and so that’ll help them take over the market. Electric vehicles have got to be at a price where the consumer considers them as a realistic option, and they have got to go a reasonable distance.
Will the recharging of EV batteries get faster?
Whittingham: For car batteries, the issue if you charge them in a short period of time is that you need a huge current and huge voltage, and, in the end, you are going to reduce the lifetime of the battery. If you look at the sellers of electricity, they don’t particularly want them to be charged very fast.
What is the future for lithium-ion batteries?
Whittingham: Lithium-ion is going to dominate for at least the next 10 years because there is nothing really on the horizon. Toyota Motor Corp. and a whole host of American companies are working on solid-state batteries, though it’s not clear how much those will cost to manufacture, and it’s not clear yet whether you’ll get a decent amount of power. They may work for things like iPhones initially, but there are some big questions before they are used in larger-scale systems.
Is there a need to challenge China’s manufacturing dominance?
Whittingham: In the U.S. we are worried about China dominating, and clearly places like Germany are as well. It’s important for every country. You do want to be totally independent. If anything goes wrong in China, then you are stuck, and that’s not acceptable.
How can batteries change the energy-storage business?
Whittingham: The sun shines a lot when you don’t particularly need all that power. And in Texas, the wind blows at 3 a.m., when you don’t need it. Batteries are incredibly useful for storing that energy. After PG&E has been cutting off the power in California, people are going to say that if they have got a $2 million home, then they are going to want their own source of energy and their own source of storing it so they are not affected by these events.
What is your current research seeking to achieve?
Whittingham: I’m involved in two large projects, one of which I lead –- and that’s a fundamental science project trying to see what are the ultimate limits of these batteries. Right now, we only get 25% of theoretical capacity of them, so that’s 75% that’s dead volume or dead weight. It’s the top folks in the world working on that project.
Why did your research in the 1970s make fire chiefs nervous?
Whittingham: We never had a battery burn up, but after you’ve cycled the battery many times you want to see what happened to it, so you pull them apart. That’s what causes a fire. The fire trucks came in at least twice, and the research site was right across the street from the Exxon refinery in New Jersey. I don’t think they like fires near a refinery. There was a highway between us, but they still worried.

DHAKA, BANGLADESH - Bangladesh's High Court on Monday asked micro-credit pioneer and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to surrender to a labor court by Nov. 7 over the firing of three employees by Grameen Communications, where he is chairman.

The order came in response to a petition seeking a stay of an arrest warrant for Yunus issued by the labor court last month, when he was abroad.

A two-judge panel at the High Court asked the authorities not to arrest or harass Yunus before he surrenders by Nov. 7, said his lawyer, Rokanuddin Mahmud.

The three employees filed the cases in July, saying they were terminated illegally after seeking to form a trade union.

Yunus founded Grameen Bank, which provides small loans to impoverished people and shared the Nobel Peace Prize with him. He has faced several investigations by the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has frosty relations with him. He was removed from the bank after surpassing retirement age.

A government-appointed investigation found that Grameen Bank violated its charter as a micro-lender by creating affiliates that did not benefit the bank's shareholders, and recommended the government merge those businesses with the bank. Yunus maintains those businesses are independent and should remain so.

Hasina was reportedly angered by Yunus' 2007 attempt to form his own political party backed by the influential army when the country was under a state of emergency and Hasina was behind bars. Hasina came to power in a 2008 election and ordered an investigation of Yunus.

Currently Grameen Bank has about 9 million members, 97% of whom are women. With 2,568 branches, the bank provides services in 81,677 villages, covering more than 93% of the total villages in Bangladesh.

After a one-year absence brought on by an ugly and convoluted sexual abuse and financial malfeasance scandal, the Nobel Prize in Literature returned in 2019 with a charm offensive. The Swedish Academy’s Nobel Committee would bestow not one, but two awards, to make up for last year’s no-show. And it promised that, after a period of intense self-reflection brought on by the scandal, everything would change.

Famously opaque, the Nobel Committee announced earlier this year that it would be more transparent in an effort to regain the public’s trust. Notoriously Eurocentric, it also indicated that it would broaden its purview to better include authors from the rest of the world. “We need to widen our perspective,” Anders Olsson, the committee’s new head, said in a video hyping the revamped Nobel. Having historically marched to the beat of its own drum, the Swedish Academy seemed, at long last, to be listening to its critics.

But when Olsson stepped through the Academy’s gilded double doors to announce the winners of the 2018 and 2019 Nobel Prizes, it became clear that the Academy had set out to invite criticism, not quell it. The winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize was Olga Tokarczuk, a Polish novelist whose ambitious, deeply political work has made her an enemy of nationalists in her country. The 2019 Nobel Prize was won by Austrian Peter Handke, one of the greatest novelists of his generation who is now most famous for having eulogized Slobodan Milošević, the Serbian military leader who died while being tried for war crimes at The Hague.
This was not, in other words, a clean break from the past for the Academy. Instead, as Swedish journalist and Nobel-watcher Jens Liljestrand told me, “The prizes mirror the Academy’s identity crises.” Handke was likely “a concession to the Academy old guard,” while Tokarczuk represents the kind of new voice Olsson said he intends to elevate. And both awards show that, despite its professed global ambitions, the Nobel Prize in Literature is still bogged down in Europe. Taken together, it’s difficult to discern what the Prize stands for anymore, other than to provide a new shock every time October rolls around.

Maryse Condé and Margaret Atwood among those tipped for the prize as Swedish Academy aims to restore its shattered reputation
Next week, the Swedish Academy will announce not one Nobel literature laureate but two, as the prize seeks to move on from a year of unprecedented scandal. The head of the award’s committee is confident the prize can make a comeback by avoiding the “male-oriented” and “Eurocentric” perspective that has dominated judging in the past.
The Nobel prize in literature was postponed last year after a sexual abuse and financial misconduct scandal, which led to a series of resignations at the Swedish Academy, which runs the award. Jean-Claude Arnault, whose wife Katarina Frostenson was a member of the Academy until she quit in January over breaches of secrecy, was convicted of rape in October 2018 and jailed for two years.
With awards for both 2018 and 2019 set to be unveiled on Thursday, the Academy will be hoping that the Nobel’s return is well-received by the global literary community. Worth 9m Swedish krona (£740,000), the prize goes to the writer who, in the words of Alfred Nobel’s will, is deemed to have written “the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”.
The Russian novelist Lyudmila Ulitskaya, the Guadeloupean novelist Maryse Condé and The Handmaid’s Tale author Margaret Atwood are all believed to be in contention for this year’s award, particularly after Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel prize in literature committee, revealed how criteria this year have changed.
Given that the last two winners – Kazuo Ishiguro and Bob Dylan – both write in English and just 14 of the 114 literature laureates are women, Olsson acknowledged this week the need for the jury to “widen our perspective”.
“We had a more Eurocentric perspective on literature and now we are looking all over the world,” he said. “Previously it was much more male-oriented. Now we have so many female writers who are really great, so we hope the prize and the whole process of the prize has been intensified and is much broader in its scope.”
Other names seen as strong contenders include Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai and Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk, as well as perennial candidates Haruki Murakami and Ngugi wa Thiong’o.
“If there are going to be two [laureates], one has to be a woman.” said Fiammetta Rocco, culture correspondent at the Economist and the administrator of the International Booker prize, adding that “they’re likely to be from different continents”.

“Of the writers who deserve much wider readership,” said Rocco, “I would say Maryse Condé, the grand queen, the empress, of Caribbean literature. And in eastern Europe both Krasznahorkai and Tokarczuk would be on anybody’s list.”
According to Rocco, the exiled Chinese writer Ma Jian is also in the frame, alongside the Argentine César Aira and the South African author Antjie Krog, “part journalist, part broadcaster, part playwright, part poet – a great chronicler of the transition from apartheid to black majority rule and what it meant”.
An author writing in English would be an “unlikely” prospect, Rocco added. “But our own Neil Gaiman would be amazing. And I think anybody who’s making a list would put Margaret Atwood on it.”
The Swedish-Greek journalist and author Alexandra Pascalidou, who last year helped found the one-off New Academy prize in literature – won by Condé – to fill the void left by the Nobel, was also keen to see a female winner such as the “amazing” Antiguan-American writer Jamaica Kincaid. “Since the prize was founded in 1901 only 14 women have received it,” she said.
Maureen Freely, chair of English PEN and judge of this year’s International Booker, suggested the French author Annie Ernaux – who “writes in a genre all her own, defying the unwritten rules of the novel and the memoir to create new spaces for collective reflection” – and Colombian Juan Gabriel Vásquez, who “defies history itself, showing its official chroniclers to be charlatans and its actors to be lost in a maze of half truths”.
Jacques Testard of the British press Fitzcarraldo – which publishes 2015’s Nobel winner Svetlana Alexievich – said it was “great” to have the Nobel back. “Can Xue or Scholastique Mukasonga would be interesting choices. In Latin America I’d love to see someone like Elena Poniatowska get it. Closer to home, I’ll be rooting for the two authors we publish who the bookies seem to think are in with a shout: Olga Tokarczuk and Jon Fosse. And I’d like to think Annie Ernaux would be a worthy winner.”
It will take time to regain trust and respectability
For the Swedish Academy, Olsson is looking forward to Thursday’s announcement. “Two prizes in literature, that is something exceptional,” he said.”
Pascalidou believes this is only the start of a slow rebuilding process. “I think the Swedish Academy lost a lot with not only the accusations of sexual harassment and sexism, and the man who ended up in jail for rape, but also in how they handled the situation with their own members,” she said. “It will take time to regain trust and respectability. The catharsis has not occurred yet. The untouchable patriarchs are still ruling but I hope they learned something after the mess they caused. It was a manmade catastrophe that punished literature.”

We usually associate central banks with conducting conferences around monetary policy, banking systems, financial stability and so on. How about a conference on ‘Gender and career progression’ on October 21, 2019? That too jointly by three advanced economy central banks: the Bank of England (BoE), the Federal Reserve Board and the European Central Bank (ECB).
This is a strong signal of times to come where central banks try and address a huge deficit of women employment in their respective organisations. In history of even these central banks, just two of them had one women chief (Janet Yellen at the Fed and Christine Lagarde at the ECB) whereas the BoE has had none so far.
RBI’s own track record has been poor with no woman Governor and 3 women Deputy Governors (of 61) in 2000s which was more of an exception. The SEBI Act actually mentions “Chairman” as head of the Board, ruling out women for the top position!
It is ironical that economists who talk about promoting gender inclusiveness in businesses, politics and so on have such large gender exclusivity in their own fields and organisations. This is also a Nobel Prize month and of the 950 Nobel Prizes across all categories, there are just 54 women. In the 6 prize categories, we have had 950 winners of which just 54 have been women. Within the 6 prizes, physics, economics and chemistry have an abysmal number of women laureates. Economics, which aspires to resemble physics, has just had 2 women laureates, one less than physics. Amartya Sen wrote about missing women from high sex ratios -- number of males to females -- but in economics, there is more a case of invisible women as there are hardly any numbers.
The 1-day conference was aimed at presenting findings and taking measures to bridge the diversity gaps. The conference presented papers across a wide spectrum which showed that the course correction requires multiple interventions.
The conference started with a keynote lecture from Iris Bohnet of Harvard University. The topic was Gender Diversity by Design where she showed how women are discriminated across marketing campaigns and job advertisements.
Laura Hospido (at Banco de España), Luc Laeven and Ana Lamo -- both at the ECB -- studied ECB researchers who were hired with similar salaries during 2003-17. Till 2011, there is a large wage gap between men and women within a few years of hiring. In 2011, the ECB announced a series of gender diversity policies and this gap reduces and is no longer significant.
A paper based on Australian firms showed that firms that offer inclusive human capital development opportunities help bridge the gaps. This is a proof that policies to reduce these gaps can be successful both at central bank and firm levels.
In another hard-hitting research, it is shown that papers with all female authors are 3.2 per cent are less likely to be accepted for conferences than papers with all male authors, even after controlling for a number of confounding factors. The gap is driven entirely by male referees!
There is more. According to a study on a research paper by Fed economists, in the case of co-authored papers, most researchers have co-authors of the same gender. This makes it doubly difficult for women who are anyway few in number to write papers with prominent male authors.
The discrimination goes beyond writing research papers to discussing them. In yet another paper, it was revealed that economics seminars are highly aggressive. The women speakers not just have a greater share of their seminar time taken up by audience members, but also are more likely to be asked questions that are considered hostile.
This conference may be one of the first by central banks, but a few women macroeconomists on being ignored by the profession decided to take things in their hands. In May 2018, a group of women economists organised ‘First Women in Macroeconomics Conference’, with a goal of initiating women researchers in macroeconomics and finance.
Alessandra Fogli, Senior Research Economist at the Minneapolis Fed, was a conference co-organizer and explained the rationale in an interview (https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/first-women-in-macro-conference). The interview pointed out that women representation across panels stood at just 20 per cent. This makes it difficult for mentoring and networking, especially when you think of the above research where co-authors are of the same gender.
Fogli argued that she is not in favour of any affirmative action (reservation policy) to promote women in economics, but more about providing equal opportunities to women. The higher representation of women in economics should not be at the cost of lowering quality in the profession.
To sum up, both the conferences explore one of the long- standing problem of exclusion of women in economics. Since the 2008 crisis, field of economics and central banking have been criticised for lack of diversity. Apart from the women issue, there are criticisms that in economics, there is discrimination against colour, race, community and so on.
The similar group think led to sinking of economies where people who make policies were those with similar backgrounds with consent. One way to prevent this group think is to have teams which push more diverse ideas and promote dissent against the majoritarian view.
The central banks -- and some other main organisations -- can bring about changes by not just employing but promoting women in the workforce. This, in turn, will act as a strong signal for the younger generation who will look up to these role models and look forward to taking up economics as a future profession.
Currently, in each of the three economic institutions – the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the World Bank and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) – we have a woman as a chief economist, which is seen as a big surprise. Hopefully, over time, appointing women to these top positions becomes a normal thing and not as surprising as it is seen today.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Once again it’s October, which means it’s time to debate whether the economics Nobel prize is a real Nobel or an impostor. And once that tired argument is duly rehashed, we can proceed to the more interesting topic -- who might win, and how their ideas help us understand the world. Here are five strong candidates for this year’s award:
No. 1. The New Keynesians
Not since 2011 has a prize been awarded to economists who primarily study the ups and downs of the business cycle, so we might be overdue. The obvious choice would be to award the prize for the creation of New Keynesian theory. This theory holds that recessions happen because businesses have difficulty adjusting their prices in response to economic disturbances.
Although it’s the dominant paradigm within modern academic macroeconomics, and is used by most central banks to help set monetary policy, New Keynesianism hasn’t yet received a gold medal from Sweden. One reason might be that the theory isn’t the brainchild of a single genius, but of a large group of influential figures who each added key elements. These include Michael Woodford, Stanley Fischer, Greg Mankiw, Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Olivier Blanchard, Guillermo Calvo, Janet Yellen, David Romer and a number of others. Picking two or three to award the prize to will be hard, but it seems inevitable that the prize committee will eventually have to recognize this incredibly influential theory.
No. 2. Claudia Goldin
Before French economist Thomas Piketty ever hit the bestseller lists, Harvard University’s Claudia Goldin was writing about the rise in economic inequality. Combining the methods of labor economics and economic history, Goldin identifies increasing education as a key driver of the fall in U.S. inequality in the early 20th century, and blames a slowdown in educational attainment for the reversal of that happy trend.
Goldin has also extensively studied the changing role of women in the economy, weaving together trends like delayed childbearing, increasing education and forward-looking decision-making to create the authoritative story of how and why women entered the formal workforce. She has advocated for flexible work scheduling as a way to reduce the gender pay gap. And she has theorized that workplace gender discrimination results from men being afraid that the occupations they dominate will be devalued if women enter. In an age when society is struggling to eliminate gender inequality, Goldin’s work provides a crucial road map.
No. 3. David Card
Great changes have happened in the economics profession during the past three decades. The field has gone from a largely theoretical discipline to one firmly grounded in empirics and data. Although the transition is the work of many thousands of economists, perhaps no one has pointed the way forward as clearly as the University of California-Berkeley’s David Card. His landmark studies of low-skilled immigration and minimum wages changed the debate on those crucial issues, astonishing economists with the finding -- now corroborated by decades of follow-up research -- that neither is particularly damaging to local workers. Those results changed the world, but they represent only a small portion of Card’s extensive body of work. If anyone deserves to win a Nobel for the seismic shift that has changed the very meaning of economics research, it’s probably Card.
No. 4. Paul Milgrom
The economics Nobel tends to favor the work of pure theorists who work on the deepest problems. And few thinkers dig deeper than Stanford University’s Paul Milgrom. He was a major figure in the creation of auction theory -- probably the most empirically successful and practically useful economic theory of all time, which is now used to power everything from Google ads to federal spectrum auctions. He has also contributed deep insights to our understanding of financial markets, modeling the way that market makers interact with informed and uninformed traders, and helping to explain why trading happens in the first place. This is only the tip of the iceberg, though. Milgrom’s contributions in game theory, contract theory, labor economics, industrial organization, the economics of information and learning, and other fields are too numerous to mention or elaborate here. If he never wins the Nobel for this virtuosic career, it will be a big surprise.

Edited extracts from the discussion:Alan Blinder, a colleague of mine, has proposed on several occasions that economists should stop chanting that free trade is good for you. While globalisation is indeed good, I think there is a realistic appreciation that there have been some downsides, particularly with unregulated capital flows, which even my old teacher, Jagdish Bhagwati, has long been worried about… Obviously, protectionism is not the answer. But to say that we do have problems, which are in some ways exacerbated by globalisation and that we need to accept that fact, is a reasonable thing.I am one of these people who believe that, to a first approximation, we spend too much in obsessing about how free trade is. This is second order relative to everything else that is wrong with the global economy and our internal economy, and we can spend a lot of time fighting that particular battle, internally and externally, and I do not think it is worth the effort.In a large economy like India, I just do not think the evidence is that the magnitude of the effect of free trade is the largest. Going from where we were in 1990 to where we were in 2007 was extraordinarily important. We were an insane economy, but I do not know at the margin whether or not this particular thing mattered so much. So, having said that, I think that we do a fair amount of trade now. We are much more open. This is a very difficult world to be negotiating right now… I am going to predict there is going to be a difficult situation for a long time.The primary problem is domestic.Our financial sector, our banking sector is broken like nobody’s business, more broken than it has ever been, in my view, and in that form, I do feel that we are in, I think, the people who need the money in infrastructure sector are massively in debt.… The bad news is that even if people came to us with tonnes of money to lend, I do not think we are in a position to borrow… our fundamental problem is not one of worrying about regulation… we do not have the kind of equity that we should have had. One of the consequences of that is that the last four years, a very large number of infrastructure and power companies that are on paper probably still not bankrupt are, in effect, I think, bankrupt. That is our fundamental problem, unless we solve that problem, all the capital sloshing around is not going to go anywhere.I think Abhijit is right that the problem of access to capital is not the core. It makes a lot of sense to borrow for infrastructure, given current rates and given India’s situation, but that is government borrowing. International capital flows have not been the route to prosperity, the route to success for anybody, basically, ever. I mean it has done some good things, that infrastructure has been built with foreign capital in a useful way. But in general, the idea that they are getting access to cheap foreign money is just what you need, does not necessarily lead to disaster, but it has never been made the real driver of growth.In fact, we do have something of a foreign borrowings problem, it is all in the private sector. It is a bunch of private sector companies which in the go-go years borrowing after 2009 and before 2011, basically borrowed a bunch at very low interest rates and since then, the rupee depreciated by 50%. So, it has a substantial effect obviously on their balance sheets and that is not a small part of what is holding back our infrastructure.We have these very large financial sectors that are devoted to creating allegedly safe assets for people to invest in and that has now worked out well. But it is still happening, and so you could say that London and New York both are in the business of creating safe assets and that has been a problem but it is not clear… yes, it would certainly help the governments who are not also demanding safe assets.I think that, hopefully, some lessons have been learnt. I think we should not start with the view that what happened in 2008-09 was entirely sort of built into the structure of financial markets. There was a regulatory void. I mean, deliberate ignoring of every possible signal. So, I do think that this idea that somehow cheap capital is very dangerous for the world is partly posited on this couple of episodes. Maybe the Latin American debt crisis was a bit that, and now the recent one was that, but I do not think that one should start with the idea that regulation had nothing to do with it. This was engineered by a particular regulatory stance in the US which was irresponsible, just putting it very mildly.I think we actually have a mild difference here because maybe — I mean, I agree with the regulatory stance in matters — although one thing that is interesting is how similar ultimately the European housing bubble and collapse, and the US housing bubble and collapse are… You can argue that deregulation was taking place in one way or another on both sides of the Atlantic, but it happened, and I would not say this is a couple of episodes. I would say the Latin American debt crisis, in Mexico, the East Asian financial crisis, which was the biggest thing ever compared with what happened later…It was not so much a cheap money crisis.It was not a large capital flows crisis. There was some… I would actually say that what has happened within Europe is more a capital flows crisis than what they have insisted on viewing it as, a fiscal crisis.But that is not what it is, that is the German reinterpretation of the fact.It has actually been one after another and so, this is not a small thing, and these crises are followed by a prolonged slowdown in growth, and economies arguably never got back on to the old trend. So, these are not small events… if you can go back to the world as it was in the 1950s, when money was very cheap that we had very highly regulated banking systems, that does not seem to be a dangerous world. And if you can tell me how I can control the power of the banking lobby and I have to get back to there, that would be an issue.Point taken but I do feel that we… need to also take on the banking lobby… I feel that there is a need to have a financial system that plays by some reasonable set of rules rather than sort of throwing out the baby. That is the danger, and that is the danger that we kind of need to manage by actually being somewhat ruthless about the financial sector. We have not managed that even in the US. We kind of threaten for a while, and then they do not do it… I do feel that that is part of the global demands for a much more regulated financial sector.One of the dangers we have is doing too little. What that is going to do is to stall growth, and once growth is stalled then we will get the same dangers from the rating agencies. I do feel that we cannot afford to be very conservative.We are in deep trouble because of this huge amount of bailout that will be needed. If the banking sector would not provide finances, growth will be slow and we do need infrastructure.……Last time, we had a banking bailout, there was money handed out to the rich because the loans were restructured and nothing happened.We should do it more transparently, but make it clear that this is needed for a long term.I do think that the idea of sitting on that regulatory fence, pretending that a crisis does not exist, is not on. Therefore, having a tight fisc is going to be as dangerous as going in the opposite direction, because once people think that our growth story is not happening, then money will leave and then we will have all the problems that we have. We are riding a tiger right now, but we need to recognise we are riding a tiger. I mean when you ride a tiger, there is no point trying to be nice to the tiger.

Danius was elected to a lifetime position on the Swedish Academy's board in 2013 and because the body's first female permanent secretary in 2015. She resigned the position in 2018.
The Stockholm University professor published a book last year about singer-songwriter Bob Dylan after playing a central role in the Swedish Academy's decision to make him a Nobel laureate in 2016.
"Everything she did was characterized by a rare strength and luminosity," read a brief obituary on the Swedish Academy's website Saturday.
Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustav said he was sad to hear of Danius' death. The monarch, who is the academy's patron, said they held regular meetings with "interesting conversations" during her time there.
"A strong cultural figure has left us, way too early," Carl XVI Gustav said in a statement.
Danius resigned as head of the prestigious institution in early 2018 after an internal dispute grew into a sexual misconduct and financial crime scandal that aroused concerns in the king and brought criticism from the Nobel Foundation's board.
Danius wasn't accused of personal wrongdoing. When she stepped down as permanent secretary, she said her academy colleagues had lost confidence in her leadership and acknowledged the internal turmoil had "already affected the Nobel Prize quite severely."
The Swedish Academy didn't award the literature prize last year so named two winners - one for 2018 and one for 2019 - on Thursday.

Story 17
Larry Randall Wray thinks it could all be so easy. For 25 years, the American economist has been researching a formula to combat unemployment, recessions and social inequalities. Modern Monetary Theory is the name of his approach. MMT for short, it goes back to the State Theory of Money, a 100-year-old idea from the economist Georg Friedrich Knapp that promises the possibility of letting debts add up without remorse.
What sounds like a miracle actually makes perfect sense at first glance. For as long as a country is in debt in its own currency, it cannot go bankrupt. If revenues are down, they can always be funded by the central bank and countries should be allowed to spend as much money as they want. Even the Second World War showed what "economic miracles" could emerge from catastrophe. "It was the basis for the economic miracle that we call the golden age of capitalism," says Wray.
Mr. Unpopular among economists
Yet with his ideas Wray is considered an economic outsider. Together with the hedge fund manager Warren Mosler, he tried for years to make his theory acceptable. But for most economists, simply printing money to finance debt sounded too reckless.
"We're definitely misunderstood," says the 66-year-old Wray, who believes that false theses have contributed to the poor image of MMT.

Among the theory's opponents are some of the biggest economists in the world. Paul Krugmann, economics Nobel laureate and New York Times columnist, has repeatedly railed against MMT. Ken Rogoff, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has described it as nonsense and quackery.
The US Federal Reserve has also criticized the theory. "The idea that deficits don't matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency, I think, is just wrong," said Fed chief Jerome Powell in February in front of the US Senate's banking committee.
Even America's left wing, which is usually open to higher public debt, is having a hard time with the idea. In a guest commentary for The Washington Post, Lawrence H. Summers, former economic adviser to Barack Obama and finance minister under Bill Clinton, described MMT as "voodoo economics" and a "recipe for disaster."
MMT-like policies are, after all, essentially responsible for hyperinflation in Latin American countries like Venezuela where, according to the IMF, prices have risen 10 million percent in recent years.
Pushing and pulling
Yet both sides agree that fiscal policy must move back into the center of US politics. It is true that US President Donald Trump passed a comprehensive tax reform at the beginning of 2018. But its promised impact is only slowly trickling down to taxpayers.
One big side effect of the tax cuts though is reduced government income. America is known for big deficits, but now currently at nearly a trillion dollars, the American government is deep in debt. Tax cuts and rising social spending have put a massive burden on the US budget, experts say. Only MMT can straighten that out again, say its proponents.
At the core of the theory is a change in financial and monetary policy. While countries usually finance themselves through taxes and the central bank prevents inflation, Modern Monetary Theory calls for a role reversal. The central bank would take on the role of lender. In other words, it would finance the government and create capital when money is needed. In this way it would be able to increase debts unhindered to boost investment in the country and avoid recessions.
US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
The theory has become especially popular among the left wing of the Democratic Party since the election of Donald Trump. Both Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are campaigning to become the next president, advocate some ideas of Modern Monetary Theory. It is supposed to provide the economic basis for their expensive social programs.
In addition to extensive job guarantees and the "Green New Deal," Ocasio-Cortez wants to introduce universal health insurance. That would cost several trillion dollars annually and lead to higher government deficits. But according to MMT supporters, that won't be a problem backed with MMT and its printing presses.
Side effects on all sides
The wild reasoning of some MMT advocates has caused irritation among many economists. "They oversell the theory," says George Selgin, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. It is true that countries should not have to worry about being able to pay their debts because they can always print enough money. But this is not without risks. That's why countries have "to worry about the inflationary consequences of paying off those debts by abusing its money," says Selgin.
Scott Sumner, a professor at George Mason University, also sees "nasty side effects" with MMT policies. "Some adherents of MMT advocate financing new projects with debt, which I think is a bad idea," he says. Today's deficits would become a burden for future generations. Instead he argues for a progressive consumption tax to support the American economy.
It's not that MMT supporters are blind to the dangers of their own theory. Many admit that there really is a limit to debt and money creation. "We know that there is some chance that it's going to be inflationary," says Wray in an effort to clarify things.
Although the US dollar is currently a strong currency, if inflation increases MMT fans will have an answer. "We may need to impose some taxes … to reduce consumer demand," says Wray, though so far he has failed to ask how ordinary citizens would react. "What we're going to do is we're going to ramp up your retirement pay and we're going to increase social security benefits." But again, this would be financed with debt. Perhaps none of this will be needed, as prominent cases demonstrate.
Looking east
The first example is the US itself. Because even though government debt is extremely high, inflation has not picked up. In February, it even dropped to its lowest level since September 2016. The proportion of voters, who see the reduction of the government deficit as the top priority, is also steadily declining.
The second example comes from Japan where the central bank has been experimenting with elements of MMT for some years now. With the help of the central bank printing presses, the government wants to put the highly indebted, demographically shrinking country on a sustainable growth path.
The Bank of Japan has therefore been buying mountains of securities that make quantitative easing programs elsewhere look small. Still inflation has remained historically low. How long the central bank can continue with its purchase program without losing credibility remains to be seen. It's an exciting experiment that may pave the way for MMT — or it may bury the theory forever.

The Economics Nobel: Who Might Have Won?
Next Monday the 51th Nobel prize in Economics will be awarded. Allen R. Sanderson and John J. Siegfried offer some perspective on the first 50 years of the economics award by providing some context with the other Nobel prizes in "The Nobel Prize in Economics Turns 50" (American Economist, 2019, 64:2, pp. 167–182). They offer background on the genesis of the prize, how its official name has evolved, academic backgrounds, and big ideas that spanned several awards.
For those interested in more detail about past Nobel prize-winners in economics, I strongly recommend the Nobel website itself. Especially for winners in the last few decades, there is rich information about why the prize was given, often with an autobiographical essay from the winner, and of course the address given by the prize-winner.

Here, I'll pass along a couple of lists from Sanderson and Siegfried. The Nobel is only given to living people, so there are inevitably some economists worthy of consideration for the prize who died after 1969 without receiving the award. I was also intrigued by their list of how many Nobel prize-winners in economics had a direct tie to a previous winner.

Here's their list of economists who were alive in 1969, but died without receiving an economics Nobel, and "who certainly would have had advocates" for winning the prize.
1921

Frank Knight (1972). One of the founders of the “Chicago School of Economics,” he is best known for hisbook, Risk, Uncertainty and Profit. Alvin Hansen (1975). Macroeconomist and public policy adviser, often referred to as “the American Keynes,” he is most noted for development (with Hicks) of the “investment-savings” and “liquidity preference-money supply” (IS-LM) macroeconomics model.

1944

Oskar Morgenstern (1977). Princeton economist, coauthor of Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (, with John von Neumann). 1933

Joan Robinson (1983). Cambridge economist known for her work on monopolistic competition (The Economics of Imperfect Competition,) and coining the term monopsony. 1960

Piero Sraffa (1983). Italian economist and considered the neo-Ricardian school founder owing to his Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (). Fischer Black (1995), part creator of the Black–Scholes equation on options pricing, surely would have shared the 1997 Nobel with Scholes and Merton for devising a model for the dynamics of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments.

Amos Tversky (1996). A cognitive psychologist, who undoubtedly would have shared the 2002 Nobel Prize with his friend and frequent collaborator Daniel Kahneman (and Vernon Smith).

Zvi Griliches (1999). A student of Schultz and Arnold Harberger at Chicago, he is best known for work on technological change (the diffusion of hybrid corn in particular) and econometrics.

1981 1974

Sherwin Rosen (2001). Labor economist with far-ranging contributions in microeconomics, he is perhaps best known for hisAmerican Economic Review article “The Economics of Superstars,” and hisJournal of Political Economy article outlining how the market solves the problem of matching buyers and sellers of multidimensional goods. John Muth (2005). Doctoral advisee of Herbert Simon, he is considered—mainly formulated on the microeconomics side—as the originator of “rational expectations” theory.

1958) 1967)

John Kenneth Galbraith (2006), long-time Harvard economist, was a prolific writer (The Affluent Society (, The New Industrial State), public intellectual, and liberal political activist. 1963

Anna Schwartz (2012). A National Bureau of Economic Research monetary and banking scholar, she was a coauthor with Milton Friedman of A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960 (). Martin Shubik (2018). A doctoral advisee of Morgenstern and collaborator with Nash, at Princeton, he was a long-time Yale professor of mathematical economics and outstanding game theorist.
To this list, one could certainly add more of their contemporaries, for example (in alphabetical order), Anthony Atkinson (2017), William Baumol (2017), Harold Demsetz (2019), Evsey Domar (1997), Rudiger Dornbusch (2002), Henry Roy Forbes Harrod (1978), Harold Hotelling (1973), Nicholas Kaldor (1986), Jacob Mincer (2006), Hyman Minsky (1996), and Ludwig von Mises (1973), among many others.
Sanderson and Siegfried also point out that a substantial number Nobel laureates in economics had another laureate as a dissertation adviser, For example:
Jan Tinbergen was an adviser of Koopmans.
Paul Samuelson was an adviser for Klein and Merton.
Kenneth Arrow advised the research of Harsanyi, Spence, Maskin, and Myerson.
Wassily Leontief advised Samuelson, Schelling, Solow, and Smith.
Richard Stone supervised the research of both Mirrlees and Deaton.
Franco Modigliani was Shiller’s adviser.
James Tobin advised Phelps.
Merton Miller advised Eugene Fama’s dissertation, and Fama advised Scholes’s.
Robert Solow supervised the work of Diamond, Akerlof, Stiglitz, and Nordhaus.
Thomas Schelling was Spence’s adviser.
Edward Prescott advised Kydland, with whom he shared the 2004 Nobel Prize.
Eric Maskin advised Tirole.
Christopher Sims advised Hansen.
Simon Kuznets supervised both Friedman and Fogel.
Sanderson and Siegfried also pass along perhaps the most common joke about the economics Nobel prize:
[A]s a well-known quip has it, “economics is the only field in which two people can share a Nobel Prize for saying opposing things.” The 1972 Prizes awarded to Myrdal and Hayek spring to mind, as would the 2013 awards to Fama and Shiller.

Story 21
In 1847 the Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle referred to economics as the dismal science because of the opposition of economists to slavery. Economists, who seek by their research to build a better society, wear this title as a badge of honour.
On Monday, the winners of the Nobel Prize for economics were named, three people who have played an important role in developing policies to make the world a better place by raising living standards in developing countries.
The experimental methods pioneered by the Nobel winners have been hugely influential on the work of other economists
For only the second time in 50 years a woman, Esther Duflo, won an economics Nobel, along with her husband Abhijit Banerjee and a third colleague, Harvard’s Michael Kremer. At 46, she is also the youngest ever winner of the award.
Very often working as a team, the trio have undertaken a wide range of influential research in developing economies across Africa and in India, with practical relevance to tackling poverty and its causes.
They have used controlled experiments where a test group, chosen at random, experiences a specific change, and they then carefully compare the results with a group that did not have access to the policy innovation.
Unlike those working in the physical sciences, economists cannot use laboratory experiments to identify what works and what doesn’t; they must use real-life situations. When done carefully, this can show what types of policy work and what ones are less successful.
In 2017, Duflo set out her approach to economic research in a paper entitled The Economist as Plumber.
In it, she argued that economists should not just help design good policies but that they must also get involved in the messy details of how policies work with real people. It’s about finding out why some things work well and some don’t. She also emphasises the importance of considering the likely behaviour of those administering a scheme, as well as of potential users.
Experiment
One experiment the team carried out in Morocco considered the roll-out of piped water and sewerage to poor households. Households had to pay for a connection to the system with the help of a heavily-subsidised loan. However, fewer than 10 per cent of poor households availed of the connection.
Duflo and her colleagues then carried out an experiment where the officials handling the paperwork went out to help some households to fill it in, while others still had to go to the council offices.
The result of making it easy to apply was that take-up rose to almost 70 per cent. This research showed that bureaucracy, not the cost, was the chief obstacle to poor households connecting to the water supply.
In another study in Kenya, the team found that while poor families would spend a lot of money on medical treatment for sick children, they would not spend even a small amount of money on preventive medicine that could greatly enhance school attendance. In this case the appropriate policy response was to provide free treatment.
Another experiment in India showed that neither more textbooks nor free school meals made any difference to learning outcomes. If the textbooks had any positive effect, it only applied to the very best pupils. Instead, the biggest problem was that teaching was not sufficiently adapted to the pupils’ needs. Another important study looked at what worked to reduce absenteeism among school teachers.
These studies have strong underpinnings in economic theory. So apart from influencing particular policy choices that benefit people living in poor places, the experimental methods pioneered by the Nobel winners have been hugely influential on the work of other economists, including Trinity College’s Centre for Development Studies.
Duflo grew up in France and, in an interview in the Financial Times in 2012, she said “part of me always wanted to do something useful for the world. It came from my mother” who worked with an NGO for the child victims of war.
I remember her contribution at a seminar in Trinity some years ago, on research which had found that Americans spend less time cooking than Europeans. The authors had argued this was because the cost of eating out was cheaper in the US and that price was the main determinant.
However, with her feet firmly planted in the real world, Duflo said that the reason she did not eat out much was because she preferred home cooking. Our tastes and preferences influence our behaviour, not just the economics.

Story 22
Dear Abhijit Banerjee,
Congrats on winning the Nobel Prize.
In a recent interview, you castigated economic journalists like me for ignoring economic evidence and lauding the recent cut in corporate tax rates. To combat inequality, you want to soak the rich and distribute the cash to the poor, and claim journalists think that the rich must be bribed by tax breaks to function. You contest our conviction that fast GDP growth is an excellent antidote to poverty.
Let me respond. You say evidence in your new book shows corporate tax cuts alone won’t boost investment. Is that different from what some of us have said? This column told the finance minister: “Your gamble of cutting corporate tax will succeed only as part of an overall strategy to make India more competitive. You must convince your Cabinet colleagues to make other inputs like land, labour, railway freight rates and electricity as cheap in India as in neighbouring Asian competitors. Cutting taxes rates alone will not suffice.”
You question our claim that global investors are shifting from China to Vietnam and Bangladesh but not India because of our higher tax rates and input prices. You say better evidence comes from the US where different states levy different tax rates and yet high-tax states grow fast. However, the main US business taxes are federal and apply to all states. Second, states with huge historical advantages — California has Silicon Valley, New York is a global financial centre — can get away with high taxes because their lucrative giant industries will not shift. But smaller entrepreneurs have shifted in droves from California to low-tax Texas. Finally, American states compete fiercely with tax breaks to attract big projects, like Amazon’s second headquarters. US evidence actually proves that tax rates matter hugely.
We journalists favour a tough tax administration that jails hundreds of crooked politicians and businessmen. That will improve tax revenue and equality far more than uncompetitive high taxes.
Do high taxes reduce inequality? Indira Gandhi raised the top income tax rate to 97.75%, along with a 3.5% wealth tax. That reduced inequality, but also created a massive black economy and entrenched the pathetic Hindu growth rate of just 3.5%. Between 1947 and 1980, India’s population virtually doubled while the poverty ratio stayed unchanged. So, the number of poor people almost doubled in the era of high taxes and falling inequality. By contrast fast GDP growth (with rising inequality) in the 2000s reduced poverty rapidly.
You say Scandinavian countries with high tax rates have grown fast. Voters in those well-governed countries trust politicians to use tax money well. If Indian politicians had as good a track record, surely the case for higher tax-and-spend would be stronger. Alas, Indian politicians claiming to be Robin Hoods have used socialist controls and high taxes to line their pockets and build patronage networks. Maharashtra chief minister
A R Antulay got builders to donate to his charitable trusts in return for contracts. It’s like Fagin’s song in the musical “Oliver”:
“Robin Hood, what a crook,
Gave a bit of what he took.
Charity’s fine, subscribe to mine,
I’ve got to pick a pocket or two.”
You want to raise tax rates and give more to the poor. Don’t politicians do that already? The peak income tax rate is up from 30% in 1997 to 42.7% today. This helped finance the PM Kisan Scheme — Rs 6,000 per year to all farmers. State schemes in Telangana, Odisha and Jharkhand offer even larger sums.
Every state election brings new freebies. Jayalalithaa won in Tamil Nadu promising free cellphones; laptops for students; maternity assistance of Rs 18,000; free 100 units of electricity every two months; waiver of all farm loans; fisherfolk assistance of Rs 5,000; 50% subsidy for women on mopeds or scooters; eight-gram gold coins for women getting married; and much more. Jayalalithaa earlier provided 20 kilos of free rice per family, a free mixer-grinder and fan per family, subsidised Amma kitchens, and subsidised goats or cows for rural families.
Yet this combination of higher taxes and bigger freebies has not created an egalitarian utopia. The recent cut in corporate taxes is an attempt to find another way forward, but will work only with many supplementary reforms.
You are reported to have discussed but not designed Rahul Gandhi’s NYAY proposal, giving Rs 6,000 a month to the bottom fifth of the population. One report says you felt Rs 2,500 a month might be the maximum possible without killing fiscal discipline. Well, many of us financial journalists have long favoured converting India’s many leaky subsidies into cash transfers that would exceed Rs 2,500 a month. Sometimes, we agree.

Story 23
Olga Tokarczuk wins the Nobel Prize for literature! This news electrifies Poland for a day, providing a short break from the political campaigning ahead of Sunday’s elections. With this award, Europeans can see how strong, powerful, but most of all, resourceful, liberal Poland is, writes Piotr Maciej Kaczyński.
Piotr Maciej Kaczyński is a political commentator and blogger on Polish and European affairs, as well as a trainer on the EU decision-making process.
The 13 October vote is considered by the right, the centre and the left as the most important election in a generation. Liberals and conservatives alike are canvassing to bring as many voters as possible.
The turnout is expected to break all known records. Jarosław Kaczyński travels the country to tell his supporters: “we are in a minority” to try to mobilise supporters to cast their ballot. After all, Mr Kaczyński has a reason to worry.
His PiS party is leading the polls with support between 40 and 48%, way ahead of the opposition. But the opposition, scattered among three parties, could outmanoeuvre the ruling party. The outcome of the vote is hanging on some 2%.
Against this picture of a divided country, Polish liberals are winning international appraisals like rarely before. Paweł Pawlikowski’s Ida swept the European Film Awards a couple of years ago and was the first Oscar for a Polish film in the history of the American Academy.
Pawlikowski won another Oscar nomination (and an EFA award) for his beautiful black-and-white Cold War. Now Olga Tokarczuk receives a Nobel Prize for literature. All against the PiS better judgement.
A few days ago, Piotr Gliński, Poland’s conservative culture minister and vice-prime minister, admitted publicly he had started reading but never finished any of Tokaczuk’s books. Today he tweets his congratulations and a promise “to return to the unfinished earlier volumes of the Nobel laureate”.
Olga Tokarczuk is an acclaimed author not only in the Polish and English language. The Nobel committee recognises her “narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life”. Her books are popular across the Old Continent. This prize will raise her profile further.
But Ms Tokarczuk is not only an author. She is also an activist. A participant in the gay pride marches, which are political manifestations in Poland rather than love parades. A vocal advocate for women rights, animal rights and a worried citizen of the world because of the climate crisis.
The world she creates in her books is mythical, mystical and a key to understand the liberal side of Poland today. Her Poland is a “violation of the myth of a homogenous Catholic nation”.
Poland without culture does not exist, argues Tokarczuk. Culture without history is impossible. Polish history is a 1,000 years of multi-national interplay. Poland is a place where Poles, Jews, Germans, Ukrainians, Russians, Lithuanians, Belarussians and many, many others co-existed for centuries.
It’s a Poland that is open, progressive, tolerant. Poland that is a welcoming home for those who seek refuge from the world. That’s a liberal Poland that Tokarczuk represents. That’s the liberal Poland that today wins a Nobel Prize with her. That’s the liberal Poland that is trying to face off the traditionalists of Law and Justice.
Mr Gliński, the culture minister, denied financial contribution to the Mountains of Literature, which is a locally based literature festival in Kłodzko Valley and is co-organised by the Nobel laureate.
The petty people of PiS. When Ida won the Oscar Beata Szydło, now an MEP, complained that the movie did not “promote Poland, in fact, it portrayed the negative image”.
The liberal, open Poland has been largely forgotten in Brussels. The image of the country is in tatters; some Council diplomats admit off the record that fewer and fewer people want to engage with Poles.
With this award, however, you can see how strong, powerful, but most of all, resourceful, the liberal Poland is. Welcome to the modern Polish soul. Grab a Tokarczuk volume before it needs to be reprinted. Around one million copies of her books have been sold in Poland to date.
Nobel Prize is greatly cherished in Poland. Ms Tokarczuk receives it as the fifth Polish author, following in the footsteps of Henryk Sienkiewicz, Władysław Reymont, Czesław Miłosz and Wisława Szymborska.
All Polish Nobel laureates were important voices in the political and societal debate, and Ms Tokarczuk does not shy away from the public eye either.
With this award, the liberals in Poland and in Europe gain a new prominent figure and Ms Tokarczuk, born in 1962, joins Lech Wałęsa as the only living Nobel laureates in Poland.

Story 24
The theme of this year’s Chemistry Nobel was set as ‘A Rechargeable World’.
Given how important battery-storage is for renewable power, leaps in digital, and the future of the automotives, etc, it isn’t a surprise that the Nobel in Chemistry this year, should honour three scientists for their role in the discovery of the lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries that power significant facets of our high-tech lives. The award this year goes to John B Goodenough of the University of Texas at Austin, M Stanley Whittingham of Binghamton University and Akira Yoshino of Meijo University, with equal shares of the prize money for the three.
While the nickel-cadmium battery, discovered much earlier in 1899, powered most devices, research on Li-ion power storage only took off when Exxon, amidst the global oil crisis, commissioned a study on lithium compounds as an alternative for fossil fuel. Whittingham, one of the researchers with Exxon, created a battery with lithium-ion as the anode and titanium disulphide as the cathode that could be recharged at room temperature. Although Exxon gave up the research as oil prices normalised, Goodenough—the oldest Nobel recipient, at 97—improved the idea by replacing titanium with cobalt oxide, which doubled the output voltage of the battery. Yoshino, then working for Asahi Kasei, which wanted lightweight batteries, further improved upon the idea discarding lithium for carbon-based materials that could hold lithium ions. The battery could not only have a higher output but was also safe as lithium tends to catch fire. What we see today are variations of Yoshino’s designs powering most consumer electronics, mobile phones and tablets.
Although pricing has a lot to do with lithium-ion batteries’ popularity—prices have crashed 85% since 2010, from $1,160/KWh to $176, BloombergNEF reports another 40% reduction to $100 by 2024—a lot has to do with the absence of any competition. Though NiMH batteries are still used in low-powered consumer electronics, lower power and voltage capabilities have ensured that they have a limited scope. More important, with prices falling, lithium has found resonance with large-scale utilities and electric vehicles. Although, in their present form, these cannot provide the kind of solutions the automotive industry needs—cars powered by lithium-ion still can’t breach the 500-mile barrier, and utility storage batteries offer power for just four hours—and companies like Toyota are investing on solid-state batteries for practical solutions, lithium-ion may overpower alternatives because of cost benefits. Take the case of Sila Nanotechnologies. The company raised $170 million from Daimler to create a battery, which holds lithium compounds using silicon rather than graphite. This, it believes, will increase efficiency by 20%—meaning more space to accommodate more batteries in electric cars and thus, longer battery service. Li-ion was successful in powering devices for 4G technologies, but with always-on and connected devices, the technology needs a further upgrade.

These “Stop Brexit” badges could be yours anywhere in the UK, but these ones happen to have been snapped in Aberdeen, Scotland, at the autumn conference of the Scottish National Party.
The SNP would very much like the UK to stay in the single market and customs union: party leader and Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon succinctly sums up Brexit as a “disaster”. Sturgeon’s party will be campaigning in the next UK general election on the right to hold another legally-bound referendum on Scottish independence next year, she announced, the hope being that the intervening years of Brexit-related shenanigans in London will have helped overturn the 55 per cent to 45 per cent vote cast in favour of the union in 2014. “The Westminster refusal is not sustainable,” says Sturgeon. “We can already see the cracks appearing.” Just a few, yes.

Getting to know: Esther Duflo
Esther Duflo (46) is the youngest person to ever win the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, which is the proper title for what most people refer to as the Nobel prize for economics.
Frenchwoman Duflo, alongside Massachusetts Institute of Technology colleague Abhijit Banerjee (her husband and one-time PhD supervisor) and Harvard’s Michael Kremer, won for their “experiment-based approach” to tackling global poverty – more than five million Indian children have benefitted from their studies, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.
Only the second woman to win the prize since it was first awarded in 1969, the Paris-raised Prof Duflo once told the Financial Times that she had been inspired “to do something useful for the world” by her mother, a paediatrician. Banerjee’s mother, meanwhile, is an economist in India.

Story 27
Robert Shiller, Nobel Prize-winning economist Princeton University Press
Nobel Prize-winning economist, Robert Shiller, predicted the dot-com crash of 2000 and the housing crisis that triggered the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Although Shiller is trained in the science of data, he made his forecasts using the art of story.
“I think it’s important for people in a leadership position to get a realistic view of the world, to distinguish popular narratives from reality,” Shiller told me during a wide-ranging discussion about his new book, Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events.
Three themes emerged from our conversation. First, the human mind is wired for story. Second, stories drive many of our business decisions like starting a business, saving or spending money or investing in the market. Third, leaders can build their immunity to mass panics.
The Mind is Wired for Story
“A man is a teller of tales,” the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote. “He lives surrounded by his stories and the stories of others, he sees everything that happens to him through them.”
Sartre’s words were written in 1938, but modern science has proven him right.
The structure of the human brain is wired for story. “The human tendency to form simple narratives around even the most complex chains of events infects even the most analytical minds,” says Shiller.
Stories spread from one person to another like a virus, which prompted Shiller to study epidemiology, the science of how diseases spread. He found that, just as viruses are contagious, so are popular narratives. They reach a peak and fizzle out. However, like the yearly flu virus, a slight mutation can trigger a narrative’s comeback.
For example, the “perennial narrative” that we’re doomed to be replaced by machines has been around for thousands of years. During stressful times of economic downturns, the stories come back in different forms. In the 1800s, people shared stories of “labor-saving” machinery replacing workers. In the early 1900s, science -fiction stories described futures where machines do everything. The word ‘robot’ entered popular conversations in the 1930s, reaching contagion stage in the Great Depression. “Automation” began appearing in the 1950s. Today, we’re seeing stories with “machine learning” and “artificial intelligence” as the next villains threatening our jobs.
The fear-inducing narrative that machines will replace humans is the same story told over and over. The only difference is a slight mutation that causes it to go viral once again.
Now, separate the story from the reality. Each technological transition has only led to more jobs, not less. “No one can predict the effects of labor-saving and intelligent machines on livelihoods and work in the future,” writes Shiller. “But the narratives themselves have the potential to drive amplified economic booms and recessions, as well as public policy.”
Why Some Stories Go Viral
Financial panics are not always based on underlying data. They are often based on the stories going viral at the time. The Great Depression of the 1930s was associated with a financial trigger—a worldwide stock market crash in October of 1929. Shiller argues that the economic crisis that followed was made worse by a constellation of narratives that led to a major pullback in consumer spending.
First came the stories of despondent people standing in bread lines, selling apples on street corners, or lining up outside banks. “Even if these narratives were exaggerated, they reduced willingness to spend on anything but the barest necessities,” writes Shiller. Before I read Shiller’s book, I assumed that there were a rash of suicides following the 1929 crash. That’s the story I’ve heard. As it turns out, the data doesn’t show that there were many more suicides after the crash, but there were a lot more stories about them. Writers made the stories more dramatic by associating suicides with the crash.
A second narrative also took hold during the Depression. Shiller calls it the ‘frugality narrative.’ These replaced the conspicuous consumption stories of the 1920s, almost as if people had to atone for the sins of the past. People heard the gospel of austerity preached from church pulpits and in columns, newspapers, and books.
The frugality narrative—the ‘new modesty’—brought consumption to a near halt. Construction spending stopped cold as people put off buying or upgrading a house: how dare they buy a house when their neighbors were out of work? People stopped buying cars and rode bicycles instead. If you were an office worker in the 1930s, you wouldn’t dream of wearing blue jeans to work. Blue denim fabric was meant for outside laborers. By 1934, however, “poverty chic” was all the rage and Levi Strauss made its first blue jeans for women.
None of this can be explained by technical models. It’s all about the stories that spread—stories that made the economic crisis much, much worse. According to Shiller, “Narratives help to explain why people stopped buying expensive consumer goods during the Depression—which, by extension, helps to explain the length and severity of the Depression.”
Leaders Should Study Business and History
Robert Shiller, Narrative Economics Gallo Communications
By now, you might be asking yourself the same question I posed to Shiller: “As entrepreneurs and business leaders, what should we do with this information?” Shiller offered a two-part answer.
First, be careful about the stories that guide your decisions. The narratives might not be grounded in fact. They just make for good stories.
Shiller points to the trading in Bitcoin as an example. When he asks Bitcoin enthusiasts to explain the underlying mathematical models that underly cryptocurrencies such as the Merkle Tree or the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, he gets a blank stare. The reaction tells Shiller that people are buying the story. And it’s a “gem” of a story, according to Shiller. It even has a mysterious celebrity-hero named Satoshi Nakamoto who supposedly developed Bitcoin, although no one can prove they’ve seen Nakamoto. “People love mystery stories,” says Shiller.
Second, Shiller recommends that business leaders broaden their fields of knowledge to include history and the humanities. Reading and studying history helps you to understand the dynamics of narrative and to identify them when they return. For example, the Great Depression stories made a huge surge in 2007-2009. It sparked the widespread fear that the U.S. economy would collapse as it had in the 1930s because people frame their current situation in the context of stories they’ve heard before. Spotting narratives early can lead to the creation of counter-narratives that might slow the spread of a potentially damaging epidemic.
Traditionally, economists study data to create abstract theoretical models. Shiller argues that the art of narrative can advance the science of economics and, by doing so, reduce the risk of a narrative epidemic that triggers a recession—or worse.

Now, I will turn the call over to Dr. Rothblatt for an overview of our third quarter 2019 financial results and business activities of United Therapeutics.
Dr. Martine Rothblatt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, James. Good morning, everybody. As James mentioned, I'm pleased to be joined today by our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Benkowitz, and he and James and I will answer questions after I give a brief business overview of United Therapeutics as well as the third quarter 2019. We're pleased with our financial results over the past quarter and I -- they're available in the press release. But on every metric, we're very pleased with how everything came out.
Let me give a bit of an overview now on some of the exciting business progress going on at United Therapeutics. Last month, my colleague, Dr. Peterson reported the FDA approval of our new label for Orenitram. This was really a signal accomplishment for United Therapeutics. It's something that we worked on steadfastly for just about a decade. And for those of you who are kind of pulmonary hypertension geeks or are really into the deep history on the drugs used to treat pulmonary hypertension, it's interesting that even though the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Orenitram, treprostinil, was discovered by the Nobel laureate, Sir John Vane. He himself did not believe that this API would be able to be successfully developed as an oral treatment that could reduce the rate of progression of pulmonary hypertension, much less reduce outright morbidity or mortality. And he was a great guy. Unfortunately, he passed, but it was thanks to him, that we developed our parenteral form of treprostinil, which the brand name is Remodulin, and he was spot on correct that, that would be a highly effective treatment for patients with pulmonary hypertension.
But it's kind of a little bit of like a pinch me moment, when you have a Nobel laureate, thinking that this is just not going to be able to work as a PO. And you slug away for 10 years, and during the course of that 10 years, you're always thinking. "Geez, maybe Sir John was right, maybe Sir John was right," and then you end up with this absolutely beautifully executed FREEDOM-EV study with the excellent results that we shared with everybody last year, and then we're still crossing our fingers up until we get the final FDA stamp of approval on the results, which occurred just earlier this month.
So that was really, I think beyond the results -- beyond the doubt not only that signal result of -- since our last earnings call, but also of 2019. I really personally believe that due to the great label that the FDA approved on Orenitram, that over the next two years to three years we're going to be able to double the number of patients that we have on Orenitram and then actually be able to double that again in the following two years to three years after that. So it's a really good outlook for Orenitram, thanks to this accomplishment of our new greatly expanded label for that product.
Now there's some other really good things that are coming up in the approval category. During the next 12 months, and frankly, we have never had a greater perspective news flow for the United Therapeutics than we do in the next 12 months. In the next 12 months, we hope for and expect there to be no fewer than three new approvals for United Therapeutics out of the FDA.
First one that we have also been working on for just about 10 years, the ISR, Implantable System for Remodulin. We hope to get the final approvals for that. As those of you who have been following us for a while know, actually it's -- United Therapeutics already got its approvals from the FDA and we're waiting for the final Medtronic approvals before we could commercially launch that project.
Second up, we expect to get FDA approvals needed for the commercial launch of RemUnity. Also for those of you who have been following us we actually did get initial 510(k) approval on RemUnity, and we're just waiting for a final approval on a kind of a special 510(k) or regulatory analog of that, that we would expect in the next 12 months, that would be truly transformative for the patients on subcutaneous Remodulin.
And then third, we expect, within the next 12 months to have an FDA approval for Trevyent. That's the project that we acquired along with the acquisition of SteadyMed. This one is going to be transformative for a very large segment of the pulmonary hypertension population, especially that segment that suffers from connective tissue disease. And there's a whole spectrum of connective tissue disease states such as scleroderma and Raynaud's disease. And all of these kind of conditions, they make it very difficult for patients to activate the tiny button that we have on all of our devices.
So I think that, that one being so simple, no buttons involved for the patients to have to adjust the dosage or anything like that, truly just a plug-and-play system. I believe that Trevyent, together with RemUnity, is going to allow us to significantly expand the reach of subcutaneous Remodulin patients well beyond the number of patients that we have already been able to help and serve with that product.
Speaking of number of patients that we're helping and serving, I hope, my colleague, Mike won't be angry with me for stealing his thunder a little bit, but we are now serving more patients with treprostinil than we have ever served in the history of the company. So it's a -- it's really a great launching point for 2020, because here we are serving more patients than we've ever served before and we're on the cusp of launching in the next 12 months not to mention the true launch of Orenitram with the new label, so really four new products, each of which have ability to significantly expand the number of patients that can be served by the treprostinil family of products here at UT.
So on the FDA approval front, I think, things could not be going better. But let's take a look at what's going to come next after these approvals. So we have also found ourselves in a very good position, because of all the spade-work and seed planting that we've done over the past few years to harvest two unblinding in the next coming quarter. By that I mean the first quarter of 2020.
We expect to unblind first of all, our distinct study of Unituxin or Dinutuximab for our small cell lung cancer. That's really exciting because right now we've been able to serve roughly speaking about a thousand patients with Unituxin, those are the patients suffering from neuroblastoma. But the small cell lung cancer patient population is in the tens of thousands. It's really an order of magnitude more than we're able to serve with -- in neuroblastoma. So we're really, really hoping for a positive unblinding of Unituxin/Dinutuximab in the first quarter and then that would set us on a course of FDA filings and then launch within a year after that to a 10-fold (ph) larger population than we're able to serve with neuroblastoma.
And then another very similar story, but different disease state. We will be unblinding our increased study and this is of Tyvaso in Group 3 pulmonary hypertension. This is a group of patients characterized by interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, a group of patients that payers will not approve the use of Tyvaso in this patient population today because they have very different characteristics. They are for example not cardiac catheterized, which is definitely a checkmark that payers require before reimbursement for the drugs in the Group 1 idiopathic or secondary pulmonary hypertension population.
So this population is also 10 times larger than the number of patients that we are able to serve with Tyvaso today. So it's a very analogous parallel situation with the cancer situation, where we've got a great drug, Tyvaso, similar to a great drug Unituxin, able to serve single digit thousands of patients, doing very well with those. And now we'll be able to unblind in the next quarter, basically the same drug, so very much reduced risk in terms of the regulatory process. But for a patient population that's 10 times larger than the one that we're already serving. So again very, very sweet situation with those two unblindings in the first quarter.
Let me just wrap up with kind of a flyover of the deeper pipeline just because we've got so much exciting stuff going on in the current 12-month pipeline. But there is upcoming a IND filing to begin the formal clinical development of our once-daily formulation of Orenitram. There will be a movement right through the IND, or just thereabouts for RemoPro, that will be the much less painful or painless form of Remodulin, again a certainly a game-changer in subcutaneous treprostinil because of its ability to greatly mitigate and for some patients eliminate the citing.
The very exciting TreT program, which we've done in combination with the Mannkind, where we're able to reduce the burden associated with Tyvaso to something that is truly de minimis, fits right in like a clutch purse or just a little even jean pocket and really liberate thousands and thousands of patients from one of the burdens of dealing with drug delivery systems for pulmonary hypertension. That program is going very well also being managed by Dr. Petersen and patients are already being dosed.
The perfect trial of Tyvaso in COPD, this is a trial that we're very grateful to Dr. Waxman leading the way with his early proof-of-concept of the excellent results of Tyvaso in the very large and oftentimes difficult to treat COPD population. So that program is being run by our one biotechnology unit and also proceeding straight forward with patients already being enrolled. Again just to be clear that's also a Phase 3 trial.
Our humanized form of dinutuximab, we're not resting on any laurels with the good results of Unituxin. And thanks to a great partnership we entered into with St. Jude Medical. We've been able to in license the rights and now begin manufacturing a humanized form of dinutuximab. This might be delving a little bit into the uber geekiness, but I am personally very proud as I'm kind of the manufacturing geek myself, that there were like multiple-fold improvements in the efficiency of our protection of that humanized monoclonal. So hats off to our totally awesome biologics and manufacturing group.
And last, but not least, very, very exciting progress on the Xeno-Kidney front. We will open up in the next quarter, the company's first designated pathogen free facility for Xeno-Kidney. The acronym for that is called a D, delta; P, pafa; F, foxtrot; DPF. And what that means is that the kidney is being produced in a pig in that facility in a way that the FDA agrees the organs from that pig can be put into a person. The FDA does not allow you, and thank goodness for that, just taking any farmer job pig's organs and put them into a person. They are very, very strict that you have to have a completely sterile (ph) environment just as you would have for any other drug or biologics that you are putting inside a person.
So a Xeno-Kidney is just a giant biologic. And there are very strict rules in terms of every aspect of infection testing and C-sectioning in of the genetically modified pigs for those organs to end up being tested in man. So that facility will come online in 2020, and then paves way for us to be able to actually, with FDA approval, accomplish the first-in-man of our xenograft in the 2021-2022 time frame.
So I've probably gone a little bit over my allotted time here. I guess, a bit by five minutes. But in any event, I'm so excited about all the stuff going on in UT. So, operator, if you can please open up the phone lines, and I will post the questions to Mike and James.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Jessica Fye from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Jessica Fye -- JP Morgan -- Analyst
Hey there, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could elaborate on the earlier pump comments. I guess, specifically can you help me understand the timing and order in which you expect those three different pumps to launch?
Dr. Martine Rothblatt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thanks Jessica. You know everything is up to the FDA, so it's really difficult to be precise about that. You can be -- the Trevyent is one that I think you can follow from the PDUFA timeline of the FDA. RemUnity the FDA filing is actually not done by United Therapeutics, it's done by DEKA, who is our pump partner, and the ISR, as I mentioned in my opening remarks it's also it's a Medtronic product. So, I wouldn't want to really fine tune it so much as to like line them up as one, two, three or two, three, one. But we do feel quite confident that all three will launch in the next 12 months. Next question, operator?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Martin Auster from Credit Suisse. Your line is now.
Martin Auster -- Credit Suisse -- Wall Street Analyst
Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for taking the question. On Remodulin, Martine I'm curious in the early days of generics, if you're seeing any sources of pressure all specific to kind of either Medicaid or Medicare, or in commercial, if there's relatively any one area where you're seeing more pressure, more vulnerably for the franchise? And then also the ex-US Remodulin sales, I noticed those were up pretty sharply from 2018 to 2019 year-to-date, just curious, if there was any color you guys could provide around that? Thanks for taking the question.
Dr. Martine Rothblatt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Marty. Nice to hear your voice this morning. I'm going to sort those questions the first one to Mike as he has overall authority, both questions to Mike. So, I'm going to sort both questions to Mike as he's got overall authority on all commercialization matters at UT.
Michael Benkowitz -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, thanks Martine. So Marty, we're now with -- I guess, two full quarters in and facing competition and really have not seen a material impact to Remodulin business. For the second quarter in a row, we achieved a record number of Remodulin patients on therapy. I think I mentioned in Q2, that that we saw the highest number of new patient starts in almost 10 years and Q3, we didn't quite hit that number, we came just by -- came a few prescriptions short. So we're really pleased with how things have evolved in the face of generic competition.
We really have not seen any peer pressure of note. I mean there's -- there are one off payers, I think that these -- what they call dual Medicare Medicaid patients where we're seeing a little bit of pressure, but it's such a small part of the business that it's really not, not material in the grand scheme of things. And beyond that there's really just, at this point no pressure, no payer pressure of note. So it's definitely I think where things sit with respect to your first question.
Second question, on the international business. We have -- similar to the US, we actually have seen nice uptick in demand, patient demand, prescriber demand for Remodulin outside the US. The other thing that's happened I think is the change in our relationship with Ferrer that happened over the last 12 months to 18 months or so. So they've taken on more responsibility for labeling and packaging of our product. As a result of that, their orders are up because it takes them more time to get through that process. In the past, we were doing the labeling and the packaging and sending it to them. And so their orders are up relative to what they've been in the past, just because they need more time for the labeling (ph) and packaging process.
Dr. Martine Rothblatt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Great, thanks Mike. Thank you so much. Operator next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Liana Moussatos from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
Liana Moussatos -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst
Thank you for taking my question. What would be clinically meaningful for overall survival in DISTINCT for the six-minute walk distance in INCREASE? And in INCREASE, why did you use six-minute walk distance for a primary endpoint instead of morbidity, mortality?
Dr. Martine Rothblatt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you Liana, nice to hear your voice this morning. With regard to DISTINCT, I'm actually not really qualified to answer that question. It's the -- our oncology programs run by Dr. Golden, who's not on the conference call this morning. So, I'm going to punt on the detailed answer to that question other than to say it is a survival end point study. So we are currently within a handful of patients from having a hard day at the survival end point and then being able to unblind and see the difference between the non-dinutuximab treated and the dinutuximab treated group. All of those patients have of course had their conventional therapy treatment for their cancers. But beyond just mere survival, I'm just not up to speed on maybe next level of details below that.
With regard to the six-minute walk end point for increase, the reason for that is, I would say two-fold. First of all, six-minute walk has long been the gold standard for measurement of whether or not somebody has obtained an improvement in their clinical status for pulmonary hypertension. For those of us who are around pulmonary hypertension patients a lot you hear all the time that their inability to do simple matters of exercise is the bellwether sign of a decline in their health status, whether it's like not being able to walk around Wal-Mart, or not being able to walk even to the mailbox, and then not being able to walk up the stairs. So six-minute walk is definitely a good FDA multiple time endpoint for pulmonary hypertension.
Secondly, because there are no other treatments available for the patients with interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis there was no need to have a mortality or morbidity or combined mortality morbidity endpoint as there is in Group 1 pulmonary hypertension where there's upwards of a dozen different approved therapies. And one wants to have the high mark in terms of -- the highest possible mark in terms of your data, which is what we were able to achieve with FREEDOM-EV.
So it's kind of -- it's really two completely different markets. There's -- we've done a lot of research on this, there's very, very few patients with -- in the Group 3, who are treated with any of the drugs approved for Group 1 for the reasons that I said before, it's just not something that has been proven to work. In fact, it's something if you're treating the patients in Group 3 with a systemic drug like a parenteral drug or oral drug, it's actually contra indicated in most people's points of view, due to the occurrence of perfusion ventilation mismatch.
So it's something that can only be treated with an inhale drug. And now you come down to just two inhale drugs, iloprost and Tyvaso. And as good as United Therapeutics is at helping patients get reimbursement for their drugs, the payers say, this drug has not been approved for Group 3. And we're not going to pay for it. So, unfortunately many, many patients in this category today have a foreshortened lives and foreshortened qualities of life due to the absence of any drug at all approved for the treatment of their condition.
So as the first one, it's no real sense to like leap further than you have to go and jump higher than you have to go. Getting Tyvaso approved for this population will be huge. And as I mentioned would be a 10-fold increase in our addressable market population for Tyvaso. So, we want to do that as quickly as possible with as lowest risk as possible and a six-minute walk distance both kind of the most logical way to achieve that.
Thanks, Liana. Operator next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is now open.
Hartaj Singh -- Oppenheimer & Company -- Analyst
Great, thank you everyone. Thanks for the question. Martine, I just want to ask you a little bit about Orenitram. I know it's on the commercial side so you and Mike you had indicated that now via the label expansion you'll be able to get two times, three times more patients. Can you just talk a little bit about what kind of patients would be more of the new patients, would be able to get some of the prevalent patients? Are there maybe some patients that might not have qualified before Orenitram can you hit on that, or on Orenitram now? I would really appreciate it? And by the way congratulations on not having that generics apocalypse that supposedly was going to happen. Thank you.
Dr. Martine Rothblatt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you so much Hartaj. Great hearing your voice this morning. Yeah, we feel the love on that one so thank you so much. I'm going to bounce the Orenitram growth trajectory question over to Mike.
Michael Benkowitz -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, thanks Hartaj. So, I think, Martine mentioned, I think in his opening comments that this is really sort of the first true launch. This is a really a true launch of Orenitram. And I think that's accurate and that's certainly how we're thinking about it. And if I think about the challenges that we've had in the marketplace with Orenitram prior to the EV label, it's -- I would say the number one challenge is doctors who are really trying to figure out where -- what's the right patient to use Orenitram. And I think the nice thing about the EV study is it answered that question definitively.
It's those early stage patients that's your functional Class 2 patients that are starting to be symptomatic and where you're going to have time to start them on a low dose, titrate them up slowly, help them manage their side effects, and get to a therapeutic dose in a sort of a four-month to six-month time frame. And then at that point, they sort of crossed the side effects hurdle, so to speak. They starting to see the benefit of the drug and then the doctors can titrate up accordingly based on how the disease is progressing.
And so I think in terms of the patient type, that's really I think the sort of the number one thing that we've been able to answer with respect to the EV study. And then part and parcel on that, as I mentioned is, we're -- the other issue has always been sort of tolerability and upside effect. And so I think by starting the right patient, giving them time to titrate up, we're really solving two problems with the drug. And so I think because of that we now have doctors understanding that "OK, now I understand where to use the drug, now I understand how to use the drug." It will take a little bit of time because you've got doctors that have historically believed in the drug and this really confirms their belief in the drug and how they're using it and hopefully we'll see them put more patients on therapy.
Doctors that had maybe a poor experience with Orenitram in the past, we know are taking a look. I mean, I was at CHEST last week and talking to several doctors that have said, either they have already taken another look at Orenitram based on the EV data, or certainly are planning to. So, I think generally they're impressed with the data and is bringing those doctors back to take a second look at the drug. I think, the other place that we're going to use -- we're going to see this use and we have seen this use are patients that have been on Remodulin for some period of time have started to stabilize and actually improve in functional class and the patients want to get off the pump.
And so we have data from several years ago, that talks about how patients can successfully transition from Remodulin to Orenitram. And they have done well over the long-term, and we're looking at some other ways -- other studies that would further reinforce that.
And so for patients that maybe aren't in that Functional Class -- Functional Class 2 category or maybe more Functional Class 3 and they're sort of tweeners between, could you start them on Orenitram, do you start them on Remodulin, and maybe Tyvaso is not the right answer for them. You could potentially start them on Orenitram for, say 30 to -- I'm sorry, start them on Remodulin for 30 days to 60 days, get them up to a dose and then quickly switch them over to Orenitram.
So, again, I think what the EV label is it really just kind of opens up -- really opens up the range of possibilities for where to use the drug. But I think to your original question, the main -- I think the main question and answer is what that early stage patients look like that's the ideal candidate for Orenitram.
Dr. Martine Rothblatt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Mike, thanks. That is such a great explanation. Thank you for letting all of that out. So to wrap up here we're very excited to have now crossed 7,500 patients. Once you cross this has been a goal for our company for quite a while, and I really want to salute Mike and the entire commercialization, compliance, medical affairs, teams that have been absolutely essential to accomplishing that goal. And I think it's now, as I hope everybody can see from the explanations given during the call very much reasonable within our sites to next walk on to the goal of 10,000 patients on treprostinil. And this can be done, one is Mike explained with the growth objectives for Orenitram thanks to the EV label.
Secondly, as I mentioned in the introductory remarks, with the three new transformative treprostinil parenteral delivery systems, the ISR, RemUnity, and Trevyent; and then finally with the current BREEZE trial that we have going on with TreT and the Mannkind product. You combine that with hopefully a successful unblinding increase and opening up a very small easy to act, easy to use, drug deliver device with a 10-fold larger population of Group 3. And it seems to me that 10,000 patients on treprostinil is a very readily achievable, reasonable growth for our company to set out for ourselves, and we have done that.
So thanks so much for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you certainly at the JP Morgan in just a couple of months to come. Operator you can wrap up the call.

Located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of the city’s South Side, the University of Chicago could be the first college or university in the nation where total advertised cost for an undergraduate breaks $100,000.
CHICAGO — Butterflies congregated on a bush as Griffin Badalamente walked past the carefully cultivated lawns and flowers on the University of Chicago campus. In addition to its reputation as an international powerhouse in the field of economics and a home to multiple Nobel Laureates, the school has grounds that are designated as an official botanic garden.
The privilege of attending is costly, at $57,642 for the 2019-20 academic year. It’s already one of the most expensive colleges in the country. But in less than a decade, by 2025, students like Badalamente could expect to pay more than $100,000 per year, based on projections by The Hechinger Report using annual college cost growth rates from 2008 to 2018. That would likely make the University of Chicago the first college or university in the United States to break the six-figure mark. Three other schools — Harvey Mudd College in California, Columbia University in New York and Southern Methodist University in Texas — are projected to cost almost as much.
“That’s not surprising,” Badalamente said, laughing. The third-year student is studying computational neuroscience and receives a small National Merit scholarship, but otherwise his family pays the full price of attendance. “My parents make enough money luckily for me to pay the full tuition,” Badalamente said. Paying more than $100,000 for tuition, fees, books, room and board and other expenses is “more money than it should cost, but I guess if it’s subsidizing people who wouldn’t have that opportunity, I feel a little bit better about it.”
Find out how much any college tuition costs in the coming academic year. This story was based on data from Tuition Tracker, a tool from The Hechinger Report.
Students like Badalamente and their families are key to a tuition strategy that began in the offices of small, liberal arts colleges, but which has now conquered the enrollment offices of most private four-year schools.
While rising education costs and more amenities and luxury housing have played a role in pressing up the cost of college attendance, a great deal of college tuition inflation has been driven by an enrollment strategy that relies heavily on tuition discounting. With it, schools identify families willing and able to pay their advertised tuition or “sticker price” through savings or loans, and use them to balance out the costs of students who would be more likely to enroll at other institutions due to financial concerns or academic competitiveness.
The strategy is also known as price-discrimination — in which prices change based on who is paying and when — and has long been used to sell goods and services. It is why we are told to buy plane tickets three months before we want to take a flight. But unlike airlines, which may increase prices once the plane is nearly full and seats are harder to come by, colleges strategically drop their prices in order to get enough students to show up each fall.
“Students — low-income, underrepresented minority — still look at sticker price. Even though institutions will say, ‘No, no, you probably won’t pay that.’” Ann Gansemer-Topf, associate professor of education at Iowa State University
In theory, tuition discounting can help admissions officers shape undergraduate classes to include more low-income students and students of color. But a study published this year by Luke Behaunek, now dean of students at Simpson College, and Ann Gansemer-Topf, associate professor at Iowa State University, questioned the strategy’s effectiveness. Looking at data from 2003 and 2012 for 448 small private colleges, it found that higher tuition discounts did not correlate with increased low-income or minority student enrollment. In fact, instead of going to high-tuition, high-discount institutions, low-income and minority students became concentrated in schools with the lowest discount rates. The schools that increased their rates of discounting most over the period studied failed to bring in more low-income or minority students than the other institutions in the sample.
“Students — low-income, underrepresented minority — still look at sticker price,” Gansemer-Topf said. “Even though institutions will say, ‘No, no, you probably won’t pay that.’ ”
In order for colleges to manage the complex financial math behind tuition discounting, many have turned to enrollment management companies that provide software to game out their strategies. Ironically, one such firm, Ruffalo Noel Levitz, found that the tuition discounting strategy its products make possible is creating a barrier to enrollment for many of the students it is supposed to help.
The University of Chicago moved its economics department into the former home of the Chicago Theological Seminary. The Saieh Hall for Economics, which also houses the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics, opened in 2014.
A 2016 survey of rising seniors and their parents by the firm found that half of respondents said they would never consider a school with high tuition. In fact, higher-performing students were more likely than average students to rule out colleges with a high price tag — by 52 percent to 47 percent. Asian students were the most likely to refuse a school with pricier tuition out of hand, at 58 percent, followed by African American students at 53 percent.
At the University of Chicago, the percentage of first-time freshman undergraduates who receive Pell Grants, federal financial aid for low-income students, fell from 15 percent in the 2010-11 academic year to 10 percent in 2016-17, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, even as students were paying thousands less in tuition as a result of increased tuition discounting. The number of U.S. students of color enrolling as first-time freshmen in the fall did rise slightly, from 39 percent to 41 percent.
A spokesperson for the university declined to comment.

Tuition discounting not only fails to support loftier goals like diversifying a campus. There are signs that it has put less-competitive institutions in a bind, as not all universities have the demand that schools such as Chicago do. To hit their enrollment targets, many less-competitive schools discount tuition until the advertised price becomes virtually meaningless. In 2006, federal data showed that 91 four-year colleges and universities reported awarding institutional aid to all of their first-year students, meaning that no freshman was paying the advertised tuition at the school. By 2016, there were 316 schools where no incoming freshman paid the sticker price.

While need-based aid has existed in the U.S. for nearly as long as there have been universities, in the past, most of those grants came from existing pots of money held by the universities, such as endowment income, or were tied to gifts from individual donors. Kalamazoo College is one of the schools where the practice of tuition discounting began, back in the 1980s. David Breneman was president of the small liberal arts school.
“At that time, on the ledger on the revenue side, if a school had a thousand students enrolled they treated that as if they had a thousand full-pay students,” said Breneman. “Then on the expense side, they had a category for financial aid.”
The amount of financial aid would be drawn up when the budgets were set before the beginning of the academic year. But by the next spring, Breneman said, his admissions office would inevitably find a few dozen students at risk of transferring or dropping out over financial concerns. The U.S. was going through a demographic shift similar to the one worrying small colleges today, as the declining birth rate in the 1960s meant that there were fewer 18-year-olds in the 1980s. Lowered demand made filling seats harder. An economist by training, Breneman calculated that if a couple thousand dollars in financial aid could secure nearly $9,000 in tuition by enrolling a new student or retaining one at risk of leaving, it made financial sense. He found the money.
“Then my business officer, when the books were closed, would beat me up for breaking the financial aid budget,” he said. “And I would apologize and say, ‘Oh my god, I’ll never do it again.’ And of course we did it again every year.”

Though Breneman was working independently at Kalamazoo, similar schemes were being informally implemented at other private nonprofit colleges. Breneman would go on to write a book entitled “Liberal Arts Colleges: Thriving, Surviving, or Endangered?” that laid out a model for how colleges could think of these unfunded grants strategically and economically. “If there was any point to do what I did in my book it was to argue that, for these small colleges — well, any college with a shortage of students relative to the demand they want to fill — you’re just discounting,” Breneman said. “Don’t kid yourself that you’re doing anything else.”
Tuition discounting spread through higher education as a way to entice students who might otherwise be reluctant to pay full price. But to be able to afford giving out those deals, colleges and universities had to raise tuition. The complex math behind their soaring prices did not just ruffle the feathers of college financial officers. President George H. W. Bush’s Department of Justice began an antitrust probe of dozens of colleges in 1989 that compared tuition discounting strategies to anticompetitive price-fixing. Then, in 1997, Congress established a National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education to investigate the reasons for increasingly high tuitions.
“Are you emailing them? Are you visiting them? Colleges are trying to get a sense of, OK, if you’re really interested they may need to offer you less money.” Robert Kelchen, author of “Higher Education Accountability”
The amount of institutional aid, according to the commission, had increased 178 percent between 1987 and 1996. The commission took a look at six possible reasons for college tuition inflation, including the increasing availability of federal student loans, and found that “there is slightly stronger evidence that increases in institutional aid have been one of the cost and price drivers” of tuition. “[I]t seems reasonable to conclude that tuitions could have increased slightly less had institutions not been putting these revenues into institutional aid.”
The ongoing spread of discounting has been aided by new technology. In the past, figuring out which students were “locks” — certain to enroll regardless of price — and which needed a sweetener in the form of aid, required scraps of data and some judgment. In his book, Breneman wrote of a clever method that one school used to determine a student’s commitment to attending the school — and thus how much or how little aid was necessary — in which the school sent prospective students postcards asking them to rank their top choices for college. If the institution was lower in the rankings, that meant it would need to deliver more aid, or give up on this student altogether. Software now uses the data schools have on applicants to help predict how much aid must be distributed in order to achieve enrollment targets.
The $81 million Joe and Rika Mansueto Library opened in 2011. The Helmut Jahn-designed building was funded in part by a $25 million donation from its namesake donors.
“There are some pretty sophisticated algorithms that — based on the financial information, academics, how much interest you’ve shown in the college — will give you a pretty good idea of what someone is willing to pay,” said economist Robert Kelchen, author of “Higher Education Accountability.” “Are you emailing them? Are you visiting them? Colleges are trying to get a sense of, OK, if you’re really interested they may need to offer you less money.”
When demand is high enough that families who can afford it will pay virtually any price, discounting schemes can reduce tuition costs for other students to rock-bottom prices even as the school’s revenue remains robust. That is true for the University of Chicago, which first-year student Ella Cornwell from California chose over less-pricey University of California schools. “I’m an only child, my mom’s an only child, so her parents have had a college fund for me since the day I was born,” said Cornwell, who nonetheless received some aid based on her parents’ income.
Roughly 37 percent of Chicago undergraduates pay the full price by enrolling without some form of institutional grants, federal aid like Pell Grants or outside scholarships that cover all or part of tuition and expenses, according to federal data. But incoming freshmen from families earning less than $75,000 per year paid an average of less than $5,000 in total costs for the 2016-17 academic year. For families making between $75,001 and $110,000, average total expenses were $15,458. For the wealthiest families, those making over $110,000, the average total cost was roughly $40,000.
The university is certainly spending the money it’s brought in. It dedicated a new $81 million library — with less than a third of its cost funded by the building’s namesake donors — in 2011, adding its gleaming, postmodern-domed reading room to the campus’ Gothic and Brutalist edifices. It added a new 800-student residence hall and dining commons, to house students for the two years they are required to live on campus. It also manages a staff that receives more than $1 billion in salary, $230 million of which is for its roughly 1,350 instructional staff and faculty, according to federal data for 2017-18. Producing and employing Nobel laureates does not come cheap.
For less-elite schools, discounting can still bring some benefits, according to the paper from Behaunek and Gansemer-Topf. The average net tuition revenue per student at the small private colleges in their study grew by about 1.26 percent per year after adjusting for the increase in costs of instruction. That growth, along with concerns about signaling weakness to prospective students or losing control over enrollments, has kept many schools from scaling back discounting and lowering tuition prices. For Gansemer-Topf, the question is less about whether to use discounting, and more about thinking critically about its effectiveness.
“Institutions can’t just increase tuition because ‘We have to look good, we have to stay competitive,’ ” said Gansemer-Topf. “Are those assumptions current?”

The Hechinger Report calculated future sticker prices for four-year institutions by using data on compound annual growth rates in total cost of attendance from 2008 to 2018, obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics, and projecting those numbers to the academic year beginning in fall 2025. The University of Chicago is projected to reach $103,248 by 2025 based on previous growth rates and its current tuition. Three other schools had a projected sticker price of $100,000 or more. Harvey Mudd College in California is projected to reach $102,508, while Columbia University in New York and Southern Methodist University in Texas are projected to reach roughly $100,000.

Paris is not the up-and-coming art city. That’s Naples, or Shanghai, or Leipzig, or Los Angeles. It’s not the art champion of the moment. That’s Berlin. It’s not really even one of the old gods anymore, big, dated, but still influential, like its classic competition of New York and London. I often find myself wondering why.
Paris makes the cliché version of ourselves into a tough opponent. Even living here, no matter how many times I see the Eiffel pricking up in a rain-soaked vista, I can’t seem to stop myself from an awkward cooing. It’s a fight that, for whatever reason, I seem to take up against the part of myself that enjoys the simple pleasures of postcard histories. It’s a boring fight, but I think it’s an important one.
For those trying to be artists in this city (a distinction I fortunately or unfortunately must lump myself into), fighting the cliché, fighting the way Paris romances you with its past accomplishments, is crucial.

It’s too easy to lie down in the warmth of the city’s wet monuments, in the goings up and down of its sun, and in the countless -isms of art history that were born or made famous here: Cubism, Fauvism, Surrealism, Dadaism, Impressionism.. .the -isms go on. The risk inherent to making art in Paris is the easy comfort of living out a romantic image of the artist here, receiving the benefits of being a bohemian in the eyes of the outside world, and never contributing new ideas to the evolution of “Art.”
I feel I have the right to criticize the cliché because I arrived here as one. Twenty-two years old, and, like all good Americans, loaded with 1920s writer-kinks and painter-fantasies. In a desire to draw equivalencies between the past and present, I went out looking for living people doing the romantic stuff I’d read about. I found some like me, foreigners in 10th arrondissement poetry-bars and 20th arrondissement cheap cafés, clichés basically, and though it was cute to role-play together something sexy as a Parisian art community, there was a sadness in the act. There was something hollow in pretending to be a collective who had contributed ideas to the world without actually contributing our own.
A friend and I, with the help of other writers and artists we met, wanted to do something to crush that hollow feeling and make sure we had a chance to live our own “Paris moment.” We started a magazine, the Belleville Park Pages, as an attempt to record the work of our Paris-based peers. The magazine was designed to be cheaper than a pint of beer, and quick to read, one big sheet of paper folded like a map. We got the magazine stocked in places around the world, in the bookshops of our fantasies. We sold over 20,000 copies.
But the magazine was limited. In the media, the magazine and the people in it were constantly compared to dead names of the Parisian past. Dead Joyces, dead Fitzgeralds, dead Hemingways, dead Steins; dead everyone else. The magazine benefited from what I refer to as, “the Paris bump”, the benefit of simply being considered an artist in Paris without doing anywhere near enough good work to deserve the comparisons (read, “any at all”).
The magazine, at least in my opinion, was hamstrung by the romance of its overt Paris branding. Purposefully, there weren’t defined ideas and clear concepts driving its editorial direction. We wanted to give people a platform to say whatever they wanted. But in doing so, we didn’t give the magazine any identity to carry it beyond its Parisian sexiness, to make it something worth a value to the larger world beyond an image. That image could only sell so many magazines, and after three years we decided to stop due to money problems. In the aftermath of an important era of my own life, I felt lost. I was still living in Paris and so I tried to connect myself with a more local art community. One that was based less on the Anglophone cliché of the city.
I found the French art community of Paris, with its own writers and artists, and though it doesn’t suffer from the same aforementioned clichés as the foreigners who try to make it here, it still suffers from its own cliché: the weight of history. The amount of times I’ve heard sentences spoken by French artists like, “I can’t talk about X because Zola’s said it,” or, “I can’t talk about Y because de Beauvoir’s said it,” feels countless. That’s not a problem for Anglophones, Americans especially, with our grandiose sense of individual liberty. But the weight of history limits ideas just the same.
Because the big ideas are avoided for fear of intellectual comparison to the past, the Franco-Parisian art community seems to silo into nothing more complex than friend-groups who make art together. Disparate art defined by social connections instead of unifying themes. Friend-groups whose ideas do not intermingle, and in turn, do not really develop. Though this criticism is clearly a subjective failure, I don’t believe that art, and the beauty it produces by leveling diverse experiences on universal themes, can truly succeed when produced by small groups who don’t communicate.
For different reasons, the French and foreign communities of Paris are failing the same. Failing in the responsibility of projecting our new ideas, new thoughts on society represented through art, that would give something of substance for the outside world to analyze (the art world and the world generally). That failure defines the unified, international art community of contemporary Paris. And maybe that failure explains why Paris has lost its grasp on international artistic relevance.
To assess mathematically the decline of Paris as ‘Cultural Capital’ is difficult and dangerous. Difficult, because numbers struggle to capture theoretical influence. Dangerous, because numbers often take the form of financials, which limit artistic importance to the base of their monetary worth. But, if we start with the accepted assumption that France (Paris specifically) invented the “collector-driven” art market as we know it today, then here are some numbers that speak weight:
As reported by Artprice, a leader in art market research, France contributed only 2 percent of global art sales in 2018 (versus 39 percent for the U.S, 28 percent for China and 23 percent for the U.K.) They are one tenth the value of their U.K., London-centered, neighbors, their competition. Those numbers are even more disparaging when viewed in the context of Contemporary Art, current creation. Just 8 percent of France’s total 2018 art sales were considered “Contemporary Art.” There were no French artists in the top 100 auctions of Contemporary Art last year, world-wide. And Contemporary French artists made up only a tiny fraction of overall sales at the world’s leading auction houses: 1.4 percent of Christie’s 2018 sales, and 0.9 percent of Sotheby’s. This stands in stark comparison to burgeoning cultural capitals like Hong Kong, whose Contemporary sales amounted to 46 percent of total sales, a trend supporting China’s rise in art market importance.
To contextualize the decline differently, we could instead look toward France’s historically strong literary tradition. Between the prize’s founding in 1901 and Jean-Paul Sartre’s winning of it in 1964, France produced 12 Nobel laureates in literature. Since then, it has produced only two (though one could argue that Paris was instrumental in the lives of some of its famous inhabitants).
These numbers are very neo-liberal, very modern-capitalism, in that their relation to young, “up-and-coming” artists is trickle-down at best. The support of top awards or large-scale investment isn’t seen, directly, by artists still trying to make a name for themselves. But award recognition and a strong economy, localized within an art capital, does help. It brings attention to the urban artistic environment and gives artists a clearer ladder to climb (if their goal is, as it is for most artists I know, to make a living through their art). That attention, which I’ve felt more strongly in other art cities, is crucial for artists trying to win respect for their ideas beyond direct social networks.
I’ve had the chance to live for some short moments in New York and London and Los Angeles, and in all those cities I was often asked the same cutting question by artists: does anything still happen in Paris? That question, a metaphor for lacking attention, always made me sad. And, when living away from it, Paris was always a place I defended, though I’ve never had a great retort to throw back at the question.
I myself have consistently moved back to Paris after having left it. Three times I have left and returned. And though my inability to quit the place is biased, I’m sure, by my internalized clichés and personal love of the city, there are more legitimate reasons for staying.
The city, contrary to popular belief, is cheap. Or at least, cheaper than the other mega, Western world cities it competes with for influence. It’s cheaper than LA, with its automotive expenses. Much cheaper than New York, (with its manic urban renewal of affordable spaces). And a lot cheaper than London, with its crippling rent and public transportation costs. For a surprising and larger context, Paris is now even cheaper than my hometown, Portland (Oregon), the stereotypically cheap, small, and funky bastion of the United States. In Paris, a decent rent of €650 can be found easily, with plenty of €500 gems going around. In Portland, $1,000 rents are now normal and considered a steal by some.
Beyond price, Paris is small physically. You can move through it quickly. You can shuttle between multiple events and meetings and vernissages in a single night. Transportation is relatively cheap. And, if you know where to go, drinking is more affordable too. This all allows for a spontaneity of human interaction, based on the public space, that defines and improves an art community.
If the cause of an artistic hub is what I think it is, price and the ability to interact (or at least, find inspiration in your competition), Paris should be a place that still attracts artists and produces quality work. But it doesn’t. Or, it doesn’t produce like it used to, when it used to produce all of those romantic -isms.
This makes me wonder, what is Paris missing? It has the price. It has the space. And it still has the Paris Bump: the lingering reverence from the outside world. And so I return to its failure. The failure of the art community to project our views on the modern world.
I would be remiss not to mention the effect technology is having on art and artists generally, regardless of location. I’m not anti-Instagram, or anything like that. But the formula for success in contemporary art requires a buying-in to the cult of fame. It requires an artist to make a name for themselves online, on social media, prior to on-earth success. Often, the gatekeepers to financial stability in the art world ask for strong followings in order to access opportunity. That is the modern hustle, and we have to play. But to play requires a simplification of ideas, a reduction in complexity in order to fit within the single-word algorithms that manage contemporary attention. So if we live in Paris, where ideas struggle to grow beyond the city, and if we live in a time where ideas are being cut down to make space for visual, portrait-driven simplicity, then what can we as Paris-based artists do to reclaim some of our relevance?
Rather than be angsty about it, I set out to do my part, to do the best I could to improve our situation. I decided to “write” a book. I put write in quotations, because in reality, the book was written for me, in the words of Paris’ young, living artists.
I went looking for artists living in Paris. Young artists who had something interesting and definable to say about society. I sat down with them in various locations around the city, often had a drink, and then spoke with them for hours at a time. We didn’t speak so much about their art. More, we discussed their views on society. We spoke about identity, sexuality, mental health, urban life, love, loneliness, technology, and the future; all the things that everyone around the world seems to be discussing. We talked about a lot of things, and sometimes we spoke about Paris too. I put their words together and attempted to uncover a narrative of ideas that uncover the opinions which make Paris-based artists’ views on the world unique.
It’s my belief that, no matter their location, artists act like a funnel for society. They ingest the effects of politics and sociology, then turn out a simplified, accessible and inspirational reflection. When that reflection is good, it attracts attention and causes people to appreciate a person much more strongly than the simple, image-driven cliché distinction of “being an artist” or “being an artist is Paris” ever could.
The book, With Paris in Mind: Talking With Artists of This Generation, contains 16 interviews with 22 artists working across six art forms, all of whom have produced ideas that I love. I love their ideas, not because they inspire my own writing (though they do), but because their ideas inspire my life outside anything related to art. Their thoughts help make sense out of the confusion that comes from living through our modern moment, our confusing now. By hearing their ideas, and seeing how those ideas help me make sense, I know I will follow what these artists make in the future, to see how much more sense they have left to make. It’s a focus on this sort of reaction, real ideas and their potential, that I believe is needed in the Parisian art community. It’s the focus on ideas that will connect artists across developing thought and innovative theory rather than across friendship, clout, or cliché. And I think only then, when ideas have killed the cliché romance, will Paris possibly have the chance to regain some of its relevance in the eyes of the outside world.
With Paris in Mind is a collection of interviews and photographs with writers, musicians, filmmakers, photographers, fine artists, and chefs. You can find the book online here. Or in Paris starting November at Shakespeare and Company, Galignani, Palais de Tokyo and Yvon Lambert.

CPI Inflation in the preceding month of August was at 3.2%.
Market Highlights: India’s retail inflation shot up to a 14-month high of 3.99% in the month of September, driven mainly by high food prices. While the CPI inflation level nearly touching the upper end of the RBI’s comfort zone makes it difficult for the central bank to cut key policy rates further, high food prices may also mean some good news for farmers, finally. September inflation beat most estimates which had expected a price rise of about 3.7%. CPI Inflation in the preceding month of August was at 3.28%.

While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Akzo Nobel N.V. (AMS:AKZA).
Akzo Nobel has a ROE of 6.8%, based on the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every €1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn €0.07.
View our latest analysis for Akzo Nobel
How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?
The formula for return on equity is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders' Equity
Or for Akzo Nobel:
6.8% = €463m ÷ €7.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)
Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.
What Does ROE Signify?
ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.
Does Akzo Nobel Have A Good ROE?
By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Akzo Nobel has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Chemicals industry classification.
ENXTAM:AKZA Past Revenue and Net Income, October 15th 2019 More
That certainly isn't ideal. We'd prefer see an ROE above the industry average, but it might not matter if the company is undervalued. Still, shareholders might want to check if insiders have been selling.
How Does Debt Impact ROE?
Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.
Akzo Nobel's Debt And Its 6.8% ROE
Although Akzo Nobel does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.37 is still low. I'm not impressed with its ROE, but the debt levels are not too high, indicating the business has decent prospects. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.
The Bottom Line On ROE
Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.
But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.

By Chang Huey-por å¼µæ å
I was recently invited to serve on a foundationâs selection committee to choose the winners of a grant for low-income university students. Having to select 72 students out of more than 400 applicants made my heart sink.
Each choice was extremely difficult, because these applicants were all in harsh situations. Their predicaments were far beyond what the phrase âlow-incomeâ could accurately describe.
Having read the backgrounds of these students, I immediately started looking for information online about funding programs for low-income students provided by the Ministry of Education or universities, and I discovered two models worth further examination.
The regulations for national university funding programs for low-income students stipulate: âThe grant pays NT$10,000 per semester to each sponsored student. The number of sponsorship places available is decided by a quota, which is 1.5 to 2 percent of the total student population of a university, or up to 2.2 percent, should it be necessary.â
This means that if the total number of students in a university is 12,000, at least 240 students per semester would benefit from the program. If a subsidy system were available at all universities, this would not only benefit disadvantaged students financially, but would also help them in other areas, such as providing them with support systems outside the school.
For example, a university could help students contact social welfare departments and apply for a family allowance, or contact medical institutions or long-term care services. This would allow the financial providers of a studentâs household to continue working to look after any ill family members, which could otherwise result in an even worse financial situation.
The other model is a Ministry of Education program for the reduction and exemption of tuition and other fees, which was launched in 2007. The program aims to encourage disadvantaged students to attend school.
Students from families in the bottom 40th percentile of household income could be subsidized by the government. The program is implemented in four ways: scholarships, supplemental living stipends, emergency financial aid and accommodation discounts.
The aid programs should be expanded by increasing the universitiesâ self-raised funds and the subsidies provided by the ministry.
Moreover, according to regulations, disadvantaged students who receive a monthly living allowance of more than NT$6,000 are obliged to work as interns for the university, should the university provide such opportunities.
A common practice in these types of programs is to collaborate with the universityâs part-time working system, giving subsidized students priority to work. By doing so, the students obtain opportunities to acquire practical skills and experience that could be applied to life and work.
People can refer to the three winners of this yearâs Nobel Prize in Economics for a possible solution to provide timely help for young people who are pursuing degrees and help them ride out the storm, turning difficulty into hope.
Based on scientific evidence, the studies of Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer provide insights for government ministries, departments and schools into how to establish a comprehensive support system for disadvantaged students.

A pair of business professors have devised an ingenious method for measuring the probability of a financial crisis by examining an entire economy as if it were a failing bank.
Their analysis relies on SRISK (pdf) an analytical tool designed to evaluate the soundness of financial institutions during a prolonged market downturn. By aggregating SRISK across a country’s economy, Robert Engle, a Nobel Prize winner at NYU, and Tianyue Ruan of National University of Singapore, believe they can estimate the relationship between projected capital shortfalls and the likelihood of a financial crisis. Their work shines a spotlight on the interconnected nature of the economy, reminding investors that potential danger is rarely isolated in a single country. Indeed, the risk of a domestic financial crisis depends, in large part, on the financial position of the rest of the world.
“Our approach is motivated by the observation that excessive credit growth, a main cause of financial crises, is reflected in the undercapitalization of the financial sector,” the professors wrote in their study (pdf), published yesterday (Aug. 27) in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). “Market-based indicators of systemic risk enable monitoring how such weakness emerges and progresses in real time.”
In other words, by examining a combination of stock market data and accounting liabilities (especially at financial services companies), it’s possible to assess the chances of a crisis. The professors also found the probability of a crisis was typically higher in global models than single-country models, illustrating the interdependency of national economies.
PNAS/Supplementary Information for Measuring the Probability of a Financial Crisis Peaks coincide with the global financial crisis, European sovereign debt crisis, and Asian debt crisis.
Although the probability of a US crisis appears low, that could change in a hurry, as evidenced by past experience. During a CFA Institute conference in November, Engle emphasized the importance of global collaboration to track and regulate risk. While he didn’t sound too agitated about the prospects of another global crisis, Engle cautioned, “I think we’ve some things to worry about. I’ll leave you with that.”
Supplementary information on the professors’ methodology and country-by-country results are available here.

F INANCE THEORISTS are, as everybody knows, unworldly people who can scarcely tie their shoelaces, still less change a car tyre. Robert Merton confounds this stereotype. As he talks amiably at the London office of Dimensional Fund Advisors (he is the firm’s “resident scientist”), you sense that here is a man who could fix a flat in no time. He would probably deliver a cheerful lecture on the importance of the correct tyre pressure while he was tightening the wheel nuts.
Mr Merton has always had a bent for engineering, whether financial or mechanical. He bought his first stock aged ten and completed a risk-arbitrage trade (on a takeover by Singer, a maker of sewing-machines) aged 11. He rebuilt his first car aged 15. In 1997 he won the Nobel prize for economics aged 53—a career high. A year later, a career low: LTCM , the hedge fund he co-founded, imploded. These markers of the passing years matter. For Mr Merton’s specialism is the mathematics of time applied to finance.

His first paper on the subject was published almost exactly 50 years ago. Its title—“Lifetime Portfolio Selection under Uncertainty: The Continuous-Time Case”—is forbidding. The ten pages of equations that follow are daunting. But for Mr Merton, the equations are tools, no different from a car jack. They allowed him and subsequent researchers to clarify an important question: when does time horizon matter in investing and when does it not?
To start to understand the paper’s importance, go back more than half a century to the birth of modern portfolio theory. Finance theory had been mostly a collection of stories and rules of thumb. Some was useful (“sell down to the sleeping point”). Little was rigorous. A new generation of scholars changed this. Their first step was to assume that investors seek the highest returns for a given amount of risk. Stocks are riskier than bonds. The issue for portfolio choice is how much of this risk to bear. That will vary. Each person should indeed hold as much as is compatible with sound sleep.
In this new, formalised set-up, investors decide once and for ever how to divide their financial wealth. But real-life investing is a movie, not a snapshot. Time is a factor, on top of risk appetite. Mr Merton wanted to go further and discover how investors, faced with an uncertain future, should decide at each moment on their mix of risky and safe assets. The folk wisdom of the time said that young people should hold a riskier portfolio than older ones, because the passing of time makes stocks less risky. That turned out to be wrong—or, at least, it was not quite right.
In two papers published in August 1969, Mr Merton and his mentor, Paul Samuelson, showed that time horizon should make no difference to portfolio choice. But the result holds only if risk appetite is unchanging and stock prices are unpredictable. Alter these assumptions, as future researchers would, and the results change. Mr Merton’s use of continuous-time mathematics created a valuable template. Finance theorists were able to apply the same toolkit to solve related problems, says Hugues Langlois of HEC Paris, a business school. The best example is the Black-Scholes model for pricing financial options, for which Mr Merton was awarded the Nobel prize, along with Myron Scholes.
A lot of finance theory that came later would tease out the circumstances in which time horizon really does matter. The reckoning changes, for instance, when wealth is looked at in the round to include non-tradable human capital—knowledge, skills and abilities. Sitting in a London office, Mr Merton gives an illustrative example.
Say, a young person’s human capital, which determines his future earnings, is 90% of his lifetime wealth, with the balance in stocks. And say that for an almost-retired person the proportions are reversed. If the stockmarket crashes by 40%, the young person has lost only 4% of his wealth. But the nearly retired person has lost 36%, which is much more serious. For older people, having all their financial wealth in stocks is not a sensible risk to take, says Mr Merton. Human capital is low-risk. If you have lots of it, you can take more financial risk.
The best lifetime strategy is a complex problem to solve, even for brainy people such as Mr Merton. But he hopes that, with the passage of time, the pension industry will create more user-friendly products. Cars are easy for their users; the complex work is done by designers and engineers. Pensions should be the same. Needs drive innovation, says Mr Merton. “That is why I’m an optimist.”

MONTREAL — For Canada, it wasn’t a typical campaign event.
At a college in Hamilton, Ontario, protesters chanted “Nazi scum, off our streets!” and clashed with supporters of the populist Canadian leader, Maxime Bernier, a member of Parliament who embraces his nickname “Mad Max” and rails against immigration and climate change “hysteria.”
There was violent pushing and shoving on both sides, according to the police, and anti-Bernier protesters tried to block an 81-year-old woman with a walker from entering the venue where Mr. Bernier was scheduled to speak.
The altercation late last month might seem familiar in the United States or Europe, where far-right movements have ridden a wave of populism in recent years. But in Canada, a country that prides itself on its political decorum and multiculturalism, it underscored the extent to which Mr. Bernier is jolting the political landscape as the national election approaches on Oct. 21.

MONEY recently launched Dollar Scholar, a new personal finance newsletter written by a 27-year-old who’s still figuring it out: me.
Every week, I’ll talk to experts about a money question I have, whether that’s “Are online banks sketchy? or “How many credit cards do I need?” As I learn, I’ll share simple ways to improve your financial life… and post some funny memes.
This is (part of) the eighth issue. Check it out below, then subscribe to get future editions of Dollar Scholar every Wednesday.
Where were you during the Great Recession of 2007-2009? I spent most of it in 10th grade. Being 15 years old, I was a lot more concerned with whether I was going to pass AP World History (I did) and what to wear to the homecoming dance (dress here) than the subprime mortgage crisis or Lehman Brothers. The recession was on my radar, but only vaguely so.
That’s partially why, a decade later, I’m feeling unnerved by all the recent headlines predicting an impending recession. You know the ones — “Recession indicator with perfect track record flashing red,” “Bond markets are sending one big global recession warning,” “The world’s biggest economies are facing a synchronized global slump,” etc. It’s been particularly bad ever since the yield curve, a thing I previously did not know existed, inverted last month.
Because I don’t have any history with recessions, it’s hard for me to gauge how alarmed I should be by these stories. And I’m not the only one who’s confused and panicky. A quick look at Twitter shows most people my age are channeling their fear into dark jokes and recession memes.
I decided to cope by writing Dollar Scholar. So, should I be freaking out about a recession? What would it mean for me? How can I prepare?
I contacted Robert Shiller, a Yale University professor who won the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics, to get some context. (Casual.) In an email, he pointed to a remark economist Alfred Marshall made over a century ago: Economics is not an exact science.
“Recessions are hard to predict,” Shiller adds. “Leading indicators that once worked to predict recessions may not work this time.”
Take the yield curve, for example, which I learned reflects how investors are feeling about Treasury bond yields at any given time. Though it has previously seemed to be a good recession forecaster, Shiller noted that “the Fed was aggressively tightening to offset out-of-control inflation” in those cases. The U.S. doesn’t have that right now — he says “we are emerging from the long slow recovery after the world financial crisis.”
Of course, the inverted yield curve isn’t the only recession indicator floating around. As Fortune pointed out, the unemployment rate is looking pretty good at 3.7%. But auto sales aren’t doing great, and housing starts, which track construction on new private homes, are falling.
A survey recently found that roughly three out of four economists expect the U.S. to have a recession by 2021. But former Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen and President Donald Trump disagree.
For his part, Shiller told me he hopes experts start more closely examining the role of narratives in the economy going forward. As he put it in a 2017 paper, “Sometimes the dominant reason why a recession is severe is related to the prevalence and vividness of certain stories, not the purely economic feedback or multipliers that economists love to model.” Whoa.
Because of this, it’s hard to say what a recession would mean for me. But Shiller said not to spin out. And so did Katharine Perry, a certified financial planner at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pennsylvania.
“This is not the end of the world. The sky is not falling,” she says.
I was still feeling Chicken Littley, so I asked Perry how I should get ready for a recession. She told me that young people like me typically have two major concerns: retirement and debt.
As far as retirement goes, I should take a breath — it’s a while off for most millennials, and any fluctuations due to a 2019/2020/2021 recession will even out by then. In fact, she said now is a good time to invest in my 401(k) because I’m getting more for my dollar.
For debt, Perry advised me to make sure things like my student loans and housing costs are paid down as much as possible. If a recession hits hard and I lose my job, I don’t want to be buried in loan payments while scrambling to pay my bills.

Nobel laureate Robert Shiller sees the U.S-China trade war creating more stock market jolts.
But he suggests it's not because fundamentals are out of whack. Rather, Shiller blames an overreaction to the drama surrounding the negotiations.
"I think of it as theater. We have two strong politicians, Xi and Trump," the Yale University economics professor told "Trading Nation" on Wednesday. "This is a human interest story which bleeds over into the markets."
Since President Donald Trump's series of tweets on May 5 threatening new tariffs, stocks have been on a roller-coaster ride. It hit a climax on Monday when the Dow dropped more than 600 points before rebounding over the next two sessions.
The CBOE Volatility Index is also reflecting the wild swings. It has jumped by more than 33% in the past month.
"We've seen volatility pick up right in response to this crisis," said Shiller. "Volatility once stirred does have some persistence, and it could continue for months."
According to Shiller, it's challenging to estimate the size and scope of the pullbacks because so much of the market activity is being driven by emotions.
"Tariffs can be evaded by shifting flows around. They're not the end of the world," he said. "The market is driven a lot by how investors view what other investors are doing or are likely to do."
Shiller is hopeful there will ultimately be a deal because President Xi Jinping and Trump have an incentive to make one before damaging their respective economies.
"We might see some accord reappearing," Shiller said.

Financial Literacy Why You Should Ignore Nobel Prize-Winning Economists
The economics profession has worked hard to make its insights inaccessible to even the most highly educated layman.
Today, Nicholas Vardy explains why you should ignore Nobel-Prize winning economists despite recent attempts to make financial economics relevant again.
“A man is always a teller of tales, he lives surrounded by his stories and the stories of others, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his life as if he were recounting it.”
– Jean-Paul Sartre, existentialist philosopher
Stories are important. They drive our lives.
As toddlers, we come to understand the world through bedtime stories. As students, we learn that a good story trumps a textbook chock-full of formulas.
And as investors, we see that stories drive our decisions about how and where to invest.
Ironically, economists have systematically neglected the role of stories. Today’s heirs to Adam Smith communicate in the language of college physics rather than stories.
No wonder the economics profession has become both distant and inaccessible. And despite the efforts of some leading economists, this irrelevance is unlikely to change anytime soon.
“Narrative Economics” to the Rescue?
Robert Shiller – a professor at Yale and winner of the Nobel Prize in economics – hopes to change all that.
Shiller is well-known for the long-term Shiller price-to-earnings ratio as well as the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. He also called the top of the dot-com bubble and predicted the housing bust.
In his latest book, Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events, Shiller argues that economists should stop focusing purely on economic data.
Instead, they should study what Shiller calls “narratives.”
Narratives are popular themes that help drive economic events. Examples of narratives include economic confidence (or panic), housing booms… and even the value of bitcoin.
Spread through the public as popular stories, narratives often go viral. They drive the economy by influencing people’s decisions on how much to spend, save and invest.
Studying these narratives could vastly improve economists’ ability to predict and prepare for future financial crises.
Shiller focuses on what he calls “contagious narratives.”
Narratives become contagious in the same way that diseases become epidemics. And the prevalence of these narratives rises and falls according to a well-established epidemic curve.

To establish credibility among his fellow economists, Shiller offers the following formula you can contemplate comfortably over your cup of coffee at Starbucks…
A New Way to Do Economics
For most economists, the idea of studying narratives is an insult to their profession.
The findings of behavioral economics – that economic actors do not always act rationally – has already done considerable damage to economics’ most fundamental assumptions.
Shiller’s narrative economics poses yet another threat to mainstream economics.
On the one hand, I admire Shiller’s openness to learning from other disciplines like history, political science and psychology.
On the other, I’m puzzled by his solution of narrative economics. The idea of examining actual events rather than focusing on theory and mathematical formulas is hardly new.
When applied to the past, narrative economics is called economic history. When applied to the present, it’s called financial journalism. When applied to the future, it’s called market punditry.
And with all due respect to Shiller and his economist colleagues…
Historians do a much better job with the past than economists do. Journalists are much better communicators of the present. And market pundits’ predictions are far more compelling than those of your average Nobel Prize-winning economist.
The real “story” here is this…
The economics profession has worked hard to make its insights inaccessible to even the highly educated layman. As such, it has painted itself into an academic box that has made its conclusions relevant to only a select few.
Shiller’s narrative economics is an attempt “to make economics relevant again.”
I wish Shiller luck. But I would not bet on his success.
As George Bernard Shaw observed, “All professions are conspiracies against the laity.” And, sadly, the conspiracy of the economics profession is as vast and deep as any.

Three computer scientists who laid the foundations for many of the recent advances in artificial intelligence are being honoured with this year’s Turing Award, considered the field’s highest accolade.
Geoff Hinton, an emeritus professor at the University of Toronto and a senior researcher at Alphabet Inc.’s Google Brain, Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and the chief AI scientist at Facebook Inc., and Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal as well as co-founder of AI company Element AI Inc., will share this year’s award, which is given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery.
Hinton and Bengio are both Canadian.
The three winners will split a US$1-million prize that comes with the award, which is currently underwritten by Google. Hinton said he will donate a portion of his share to the University of Toronto’s humanities department. “They are much less well-funded and I think the humanities are very important to the future,” he said in an interview. Bengio said he may use his share to help fight climate change.
Past winners of the award, sometimes called the “Nobel Prize of Computing,” have included Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the world wide web, and Whitfield Diffie, who helped pioneer public-key cryptography.
This year’s three winners are often referred to collectively as the “Godfathers of Deep Learning” for their research into neural networks — a kind of machine-learning software that loosely mimics the way the human brain works.
In 1983 Hinton co-invented Boltzmann machines, one of the first types of neural networks to use statistical probabilities. Three years later, he co-authored a seminal paper demonstrating that a technique for updating the strength of the connections within a neural network, known as backpropagation, could imbue this software with remarkable learning capabilities.
When Hinton began work with neural networks in the late-1970s and early-1980s, they were deeply unfashionable. At the time, most computer scientists believed the technique was a dead end. Software that explicitly encoded human expertise in a complicated set of rules was deemed a better approach to artificial intelligence.
Today, deep neural networks using backpropagation underpin most advances in artificial intelligence, from Facebook’s ability to automatically tag your friends in photos to the voice recognition capabilities of Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and Google’s translations from English to Mandarin.
LeCun, who did postdoctoral work under Hinton and worked to improve his backpropagation techniques, developed convolutional neural networks, the kind of software architecture that gives today’s computer vision systems their power.
Bengio, who worked with LeCun on computer vision breakthroughs when they were at Bell Labs, went on to apply neural networks to natural language processing, leading to big advances in machine translation. More recently, he has worked on a method best known for enabling neural networks to create completely novel, but highly realistic, images.
Hinton, in an interview ahead of the announcement, said he believes deep learning will eventually allow computers to have human-like or even super-human intelligence.
“I think we will discover that conscious, rational reasoning is not separate from deep learning but a high-level description of what is happening inside very large neural networks,” he said.
Bengio, who participated in the same interview, said new architectures for deep learning would be needed, however, before a neural networks could match the kind of general intelligence the human brain possesses.
Hinton disparaged the idea — which has been advocated by New York University professor Gary Marcus among others — that deep learning will need to be combined with older, symbolic AI techniques to achieve human-level intelligence. Hinton compared this to using electric motors only to run the fuel-injectors of gasoline engines, even though electricity is far more energy efficient.
But both were wary about offering predictions for when deep learning might yield general intelligence. Hinton noted that when he developed backpropagation, he thought practical applications of deep learning would happen almost immediately. “We were quite optimistic,” he said.
Instead, it took almost a quarter century, and the advent of much larger data sets and more powerful computers, before commercial applications of deep learning became viable.
“We had no way of estimating how much data you would need and how much computation you would need,” he said. It wasn’t until 2009, when deep learning methods made speech recognition much better than prior techniques, that Hinton said he was finally certain the method was on the verge of having a massive real world impact.
Hinton and Bengio said they were concerned about misuse of the technology they helped invent, especially regarding weapons systems that use deep learning to find and engage targets without human input. But both said the positive impact of deep learning, which they think will vastly improve business productivity, will outweigh any ill effects.

Story 51
For more than 40 years, Muhammad Yunus has been building a financial system for people who lack sufficient access to the one that already exists. In 2006, the now 78-year old won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work as “banker to the poor.”
In the 1970s, Yunus began work on what would shortly become Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which provides small loans to entrepreneurs, primarily women, who otherwise couldn’t access funds due to a lack of collateral and other resources. This model of microfinance has since been replicated all over the world. Grameen Bank takes deposits to finance the loans it offers; it decided in 1995 that it wouldn’t accept donations. For Yunus, ending poverty isn’t about charity.
Last month, the 10-year-old US division of Grameen announced that it had provided more than $1 billion in loans to 106,000 women. Over the next decade, it plans to provide $1 billion in loans every year, and nearly double the number of branches, to 42.
Quartz spoke with Yunus at the One Young World summit at The Hague, which brings together 2,000 young people from 190 countries who are working to improve their societies, and the world at large, by fighting to end sexual violence, improve access to education, and demand justice and human rights accountability from governments. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Quartz: Since the 1970s, has your view of microcredit changed?
Yunus: Microcredit still remains the same as when we started in Bangladesh 40 years back. But many more people around the world have started microcredit programs. Some took advantage of credibility of the word “microcredit”—they used it to make money for themselves, turning into loan sharks.
But after 42 years of our work, it’s not gone into the mainstream. Microcredit has remained at the NGO level, a footnote in the financial sector.
Earlier this year, the World Bank showed how little progress there has been: The proportion of people with active accounts has stagnated and the gap in financial inclusion between men and women has stayed the same.
The very word “inclusion” is suspect. This is not about inclusion; it’s about having a separate kind of banking institution to address the people at the very bottom. Today, there’s only one kind of financial institution, which are banks for the rich. You are asking the banks for the rich to lend to the poor. The very system is designed in a completely different way. This machine doesn’t work for them. The way to really address the problem of the rejected people from the financial system is to create a new financial system.
What does that new system look like?
Like a Grameen bank. It’s a bank for the poor and it doesn’t lend money to the rich. The bank for the rich doesn’t lend money to the poor. That’s a simple division. Two systems.
How do you convince the world to create this dual system?
For the same reason you want to change the situation of poverty. Governments are used to giving grants to poor people for survival. Whether you are a rich country or a poor country, every country does that. Instead of giving grants, it’s much cheaper to do it as a loan. The money comes back, covers its own cost, and is sustainable. It’s a market-based system.
What is the most effective way you’ve seen to tackle poverty in recent years?
Whichever way you do it, it has to create income. In order to create income you have to encourage people to become entrepreneurs.
If you talk about poverty, often you hear about education. “Give them education” is the common response. Education, and then what? The job market has not done much good. In many countries, 50% of young people are unemployed.
Entrepreneurship is also risky, though. Not every venture succeeds. What about safety nets to encourage young people to take risks?
I try to avoid safety nets because if you create them you are giving assurance that you don’t have to work. That’s a disincentive to begin with. That creates dependency. So I say don’t give the money but put the money in some other fund, in a social business venture capital fund. So when young people fail, this money will come to help them do it again so they don’t feel afraid.
We can build security, but not as a dependence. It can be an insurance program because that is not a dependence.
There’s a lot of new research into direct cash transfers. What’s your view on giving cash to entrepreneurs versus credit?
If it comes as a grant then there’s no responsibility, and the money can be misused easily. A loan comes with responsibility: you have to create a return from it. People become very relaxed if they are guaranteed money because they will get it again. If you fail, the second round of cash transfers will come, so why make an effort?
That puts a lot of pressure on young people. It also suggests that many people would be too relaxed about a cash-transfer system. It’s similar to the debate around universal basic income, with one side claiming that people would become lazy and stop working.
The welfare system never produced any entrepreneurs. The welfare system in every country, you don’t see anybody coming out. They go in and stay there because you take care of them. UBI is the same thing; it’s a welfare system. Charity doesn’t create activity. Charity is a dependence creation. Dependence creation is always a negative thing for a society. Systems should be geared towards us creating activity. Creating entrepreneurship rather than dependence. Taking risk. That’s what human beings are for.
This seems to be a system dependent on capitalism, but an idealized one that serves everyone. However, the very need for microcredit is an example of a market failure.
The whole capitalist system has failed. The very number of poor people showed that it failed. It pushes all the wealth to the top continuously and the top became very fat and owned by few people. What kind of system is that? We have to redesign the system.
What would this system look like?
Capitalism went wrong because it started with the wrong premise. It misrepresents human beings and says we are driven by self interest. I think this is a grossly wrong statement. Human beings are both driven by self interest and selflessness. The economic system forgot the selflessness part, and once we include it into the business then you have two kinds of business: business to make money and business to solve problems. Then the economic system becomes different.
Finally, I want to ask about sustainable finance, which is gaining momentum by promising more environmental, social, and governance considerations among investors.
These are buzzwords. There’s nothing called “sustainable finance” because the poor people are not included in that financial system. It’s a system for the rich. It’s as simple as that. Unless you have a financial system which includes the poorest person, then sustainability doesn’t exist.

Pay grades will rise for researchers at South Korea's Institute for Basic Science under reforms.Credit: Institute for Basic Science
The Institute for Basic Science — South Korea’s flagship basic-research organization — is being restructured after a year of scandals and criticism, including allegations of misappropriated funds and nepotism.
The nation’s science ministry announced on 10 September that the reform measures will include changes to the institute’s administrative structure, its purchasing system and its pay grades.
The Institute for Basic Science (IBS) was founded in 2011, and is modelled on the Max Planck Society in Germany and RIKEN in Japan. It is often referred to as South Korea’s ‘Nobel prize project’ — an attempt to win the country’s first scientific Nobel.
South Korea’s ‘Nobel prize project’ rocked by tough year
But in the past year, the organization has been rocked by financial-mismanagement allegations against several IBS centres that have been raised in the media and parliamentary hearings. As a result, 28 of the institute’s 30 centres have been audited in a number of government investigations, the most recent of which ran until August. The science ministry said the results of the audits informed the reorganization.
As part of the reforms, 97 members of administrative staff from 19 centres will be consolidated into 5 administration centres. These include centres at IBS headquarters in Daejeon, as well as on university campuses at KAIST in Daejeon, the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology and the Pohang University of Science and Technology. This is intended to improve administrative efficiency and to allow centre directors to focus on research.
But Andreas Heinrich, director of the IBS Center for Quantum Nanoscience in Seoul, thinks that moving support staff away from research centres will add more layers of administration. “Less autonomy means less creativity,” he says.
Administrative staff need to attend scientific meetings to understand the centre’s activities and to ensure that solutions to any problems follow IBS regulations, says Yannis Semertzidis, director of the IBS Center for Axion and Precision Physics Research at KAIST.
Five hubs of Asian science
The reforms will also see researchers’ minimum salaries increase over time. And to further reduce the administrative burden on directors, a central purchasing system will be introduced to handle frequently bought commodities such as materials, reagents and office supplies.
The nation’s new science minister, Choi Ki-young, was inaugurated on 10 September, after being appointed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. In remarks after his inauguration, Choi vowed to “spare no investment in basic science”, saying it would protect against an uncertain future.
Calls for further investment in basic science in South Korea have grown amid an escalating trade dispute with Japan that threatens to disrupt supplies of key semiconductor components. Basic science, many say, can help to ensure that South Korea has its own supply chain, giving it technological independence.

Nobel-prize winning economist Robert Shiller sees justification for a quarter-point interest rate hike.
That's right: A hike — not the cut Wall Street is expecting Wednesday from the Federal Reserve.
"We still have a very low unemployment rate. The economy is hot," the Yale University professor told CNBC's "Trading Nation" on Monday. "One could easily make a case for staying the course and doing another interest rate increase at this meeting to cool this economy."
If the Fed slashes rates, it'll be the first time since December 2008 amidst the financial crisis. Even though Shiller says the Fed is doing a "brilliant job" navigating the twists and turns of the market and economy, he questions whether a move lower is necessary.
"While the inflation rate is below the target, it's not that much more below it. The target is 2% and the inflation rate is 1.5%," said Shiller. "We just set a new record. We passed 3,000 on the S&P 500. We are at a really high market."
The S&P, Dow and Nasdaq are on pace for their sixth positive month in seven and are fractions of a percent off their all-time highs. Since the Christmas Eve meltdown, the S&P and Dow have surged at least 25% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up almost 35%.
It's a rally that could lead to a historic drop, according to Shiller. Since 2016, he has been comparing similarities between the current bull market and 1929. Now, stocks are even more expensive, and he's not sure a rate hike would foil a potential crash.
"The Fed raised interest rates just before the stock market in 1929 crashed. They were concerned about overvaluation of the market and wanted to cool it," he said. "It didn't cool it very effectively. It caused a disaster. I'm a historian. I think about those things."

Handled well by avoiding physical and mental wear and tear, telomeres can protect chromosomes, helping to delay the ageing process. Blackburn’s discovery (with Carol Greider and Jack Szotaks) of the enzyme telomerase earned her a joint Nobel Prize in 2009 and demonstrated the key role DNA plays in health and ageing.
For those seeking a quick fix, however, there’s no medical magic bullet. Anti-depressants may be mood-altering, she explains, but they are not mentally enhancing. Nevertheless, she is the bearer of good news, and it’s essentially about the individual practicing a form of enlightened common sense. You should be more Zen in a fitness-oriented sort of way, according to Blackburn; or, to misquote Jerry McGuire from the eponymous film, you have to help telomeres to help you.
Optimising wellbeing and increasing life expectancy are largely about getting the simple things right – regular exercise, eating healthy food and decluttering the mind through meditation. It also helps to work in a job that keeps you stimulated.
Another factor is genes. If you have good genes, and lead a healthy, well-balanced life you should, according to Blackburn, improve your prospects for longevity by about 30 per cent. The life-span paradox is that you will get more bang from your exercise buck if you start behind the proverbial genetic eight ball. Those with a lower quality genetic make-up could triple their prospects for a long life through regular exercise and good habits. “You could really move the needle by exercising,” she says.

Meanwhile, our first course of potato and roe arrives. Surrounded by white butter and featuring herring and trout roe, it’s a dish originally prepared by chef Clare Smyth at her Core restaurant in London. It has shunted aside other In Situ offerings like red onion and coconut soup with masala spice and Comte cheese, originally prepared by chef Adeline Grattard from Yam’Tcha restaurant in Paris, or tapioca and cheese fritters courtesy of Rodrigo Oliveira from Mocoto restaurant in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The potato and roe looks exquisite. Blackburn slices it in a manner betraying a practiced lab technician. “We’re just slaves to the visual” but “somebody has to do it”, she theatrically laments about disrupting the food porn in front of us. After tasting a morsel, she adds: “That is absolutely delicious potato.”
As she masticates, I ask where it all began for the joint-winner of the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine, 53 other international awards and too many honorary doctorates to mention, and who was named one of the 100 most influential people by Time magazine.
We all come from somewhere, as former prime minister Paul Keating once remarked, and for her it started in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1948. Elizabeth Blackburn was the second of seven children. Both parents were GPs and the family moved from Hobart to Launceston when she was four. Later, she attended school in London when her parents undertook further medical training, and completed her secondary education at the selective University High School in Melbourne.

She studied biochemistry at Melbourne University, gaining bachelor and master’s degrees, and secured admission to the world-renowned Cambridge laboratories to start research work for a PhD. "I wanted to go to Cambridge. They said, ‘Everyone who comes from the colonies has to have done a year’s research'.”
At Cambridge, Elizabeth Blackburn was mentored by British molecular scientist Frederick Sanger – “he got two Nobel Prizes” – and worked on how information is encoded into DNA. It was at Cambridge, in 1953, that James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double helix – the twisted ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.
This opened the way to the rapid growth of modern molecular biology, which is primarily concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells. It also led to new insights into human genetic code, genetic engineering, gene sequencing, biotechnology, modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and, finally, gene therapy, although the latter hasn’t yet happened.

The path-breaking work consumed young scientists like Blackburn. “The lab where I worked was a very storied institution. You didn’t belong anywhere except in the research. It was very immersive. Cambridge was the mecca and I was in this science heaven. Pilgrims came from all over the world.”
They included John Sedat, a young biophysicist from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The two met and formed a connection – personally and professionally. “We have always had parallel paths: we understand each other’s science quite well.”
Blackburn followed Sedat – the surname is Lithuanian in origin – to Yale University, about 170 kilometres north of New York. There she completed her PhD, got married, and started making the discoveries that two decades later led to being jointly awarded the Nobel Prize. The citation reads: “For the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase."
From Yale, the married couple headed west to San Francisco and research appointments at the University of California in Berkeley and San Francisco. When she started her supervisors said simply “this is your space” and left her to get on with it.
“I remember scrubbing down the walls and feeling so happy that they trusted me to just do my research. It was this very amazing feeling. It was heady to be trusted and just go for it.”
By contrast, “I didn’t think it was going to be easy as a woman doing science in Australia. I had already picked up a lot of signals. Even when I was doing a master's degree it was very clear there was a lot of subtle and not so subtle things. I didn’t think I would thrive in that.”

More recently, Blackburn believes former prime minister Julia Gillard “was very viciously attacked and it’s difficult to separate out a sort of misogyny”.
When she started her research in the US, however, the women’s liberation movement was in full flight “and I thought ‘I am going to flourish there.” Nearly 45 years later, “I am happy in the US” and ”I like doing what I do.”
When she started her research in the US, however, the women’s liberation movement was very much flourishing: "I thought, ‘I'm going to flourish here.'”

Nearly 45 years later, Blackburn says she is "happy in the US” and "I like doing what I do”.
As a “doing” person, Blackburn practices what she preaches. As we start on the Warhol-inspired soup for our main course, she explains how she enrolled in a meditation course in the beautiful Californian coastal town of Santa Barbara. “I took the course because I didn’t know what meditation meant. It wasn’t self-medicating but self-educating.”
It was intense – nine hours a day – but “after six days I could see my brain had changed for the better. I was able to focus. I did much less multitasking. You can put your brain into that state pretty quickly – waiting for the computer screen to come up, waiting for the bus to arrive."
At the same time, she understands that in the real world, doing all these things – exercise, eating well, meditating, having a good job – is not always possible. But you can still improve your longevity if you can only undertake one or two, so “it doesn’t sound all woo woo.”
We share a delicious Jasper Hill Farm cheesecake, courtesy of Albert Adria from that food heaven of Barcelona, and this seems to be as good a time as any to talk about the future.
“I am in a very privileged bubble. You look and say 'Wow, the world is in good hands. However, this whole winner-take-all mentality is being pushed into more and more extremes. Look what happened in Tsarist Russia – this is where it goes.”

But this is the US and amid the horror there is hope. Finishing lunch with a low-fat milk latte, Blackburn says her position gives her “a certain platform” and she intends to use it, promoting more diversity in the sciences. “You start to get used to a group think way of doing things.

Mr. Lanier said he had declined any funding from Mr. Epstein and that he had met with him only once after Mr. Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor.
Mr. Epstein was willing to finance research that others viewed as bizarre. He told one scientist that he was bankrolling efforts to identify a mysterious particle that might trigger the feeling that someone is watching you.
At one session at Harvard, Mr. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor because doing so increased the risk of overpopulation, said Mr. Pinker, who was there. Mr. Pinker said he had rebutted the argument, citing research showing that high rates of infant mortality simply caused people to have more children. Mr. Epstein seemed annoyed, and a Harvard colleague later told Mr. Pinker that he had been “voted off the island” and was no longer welcome at Mr. Epstein’s gatherings.
Then there was Mr. Epstein’s interest in eugenics.
On multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and wealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it.
It was not a secret. The adviser, for example, said he was told about the plans not only by Mr. Epstein, at a gathering at his Manhattan townhouse, but also by at least one prominent member of the business community. One of the scientists said Mr. Epstein divulged his idea in 2001 at a dinner at the same townhouse; the other recalled Mr. Epstein discussing it with him at a 2006 conference that he hosted in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.
The idea struck all three as far-fetched and disturbing. There is no indication that it would have been against the law.

Nobel laureate Richard Thaler has put forward a new idea to allow individuals to use their 401(k) savings to increase their Social Security benefits. Thaler, a behavioral economist and professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, discussed the idea at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution, a non-profit public policy organization, last week. According to Thaler, retirement savers face two problems when it comes to managing their money: how to effectively save for their golden years, and then how to make that pot of money last for the rest of their lives. "You have to worry about getting unlucky and living to 100," Thaler said.

That retirement income problem is amplified by a cultural change for today's retirees. While previous generations entered retirement with their mortgages paid off, today's retirees typically have high debts and insufficient savings, Thaler said. That's where Thaler said his new idea regarding Social Security benefits would come in. The plan would let you take a portion of your 401(k) benefits — say, $100,000 or up to $250,000 — and send it to the Social Security Administration. What you would get in return would be the only indexed annuity that's guaranteed by the federal government at a fair actuarial value, Thaler said. "This may seem like a wild and crazy idea, but actually all the math has already been done by the Social Security Administration," Thaler said. That is because the system already adjusts your benefits for your age, for each year you work and the income you take in while receiving benefits, he said. But Social Security experts do not necessarily think the plan is that simple. Boston University economics professor Laurence Kotlikoff said he thinks Thaler's plan is "dicey" and worries how it would impact the future of Social Security. As it stands, Social Security will only be able fund about 80% of promised benefits by 2035, provided Congress does not intervene, it was announced on Monday.

Nobel Prize Winner Robert Shiller thinks the economy is about to go belly up. Source: Getty
Nobel Prize winner and economist Robert Shiller, dubbed Dr Doom, accurately predicted two economic crises – and now he’s making predictions about a third.
Shiller predicted both the ‘dot-com’ bust (the 78 per cent fall in the Nasdaq between 2000 and 2004) and the collapse in the US housing market that led to the global financial crisis in 2008.
In his new book Narrative Economics, Shiller is now warning economists they’re missing some major red flags about the economy.
The bursting of the US housing bubble in 2006 and 2007 played a major role in the 2008 GFC, with sharp declines in house prices forcing the subprime mortgage crisis and, ultimately, a recession.
And Shiller said we’re here again.
“I have seen this happen before. We’re back in 2005 again when the rate of increase in home prices was slowing down a lot but still going up,” he said.
“It would not take me be any surprise at all if in the next year or two we saw modest declines in home prices and if things play out right, there could be bigger declines. It has happened before on a number of occasions.”
Robert Shiller’s ‘narrative theory’
Stories and beliefs have the power to move economies, Shiller explained in his new book.
“It is very important, if we are to have a substantial understanding of the kinds of big economic events that have surprised us so often, that we have some scientific methods of studying the narrative elements of these,” he said.
Shiller discusses his observations on what makes narratives go viral, like the ‘get rich quick’ narrative that led to Bitcoin’s surge in popularity, and US President Donald Trump’s ostentatious lifestyle narrative.
Shiller said the "new Trump narrative encourages spending and encourages their reluctance to want to depend on social insurance".

U.S. stock markets may have recovered slightly from sharp falls at the end of last year, but there's still a risk of a significant downward trend, Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University and a Nobel laureate, told CNBC Wednesday.
"I'm not confident of my ability to predict, but I think there's a risk (of a bear market in 2019), yes," he said. "I categorize risks in terms of 'narratives' and this bear market narrative has taken a strong hold."
"There is a feeling that the stock market might be due for some deflating now because it's been a long time, and we've seen some hints of it and we haven't seen the real deflation yet," he told CNBC at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.
Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2013 for his work on asset prices and inefficient markets, said he didn't pay as much attention to fundamentals driving markets but was "more interested in psychology" and popular "narratives."
The economist has previously told CNBC that the 1920-21 Depression, the Great Depression of the 1930s and Great Recession of 2007-9 were largely driven by narratives.
"I have this quarrel with economists about fundamentals, I'm writing a book on 'narrative economics' and think it's stories that drive markets more than fundamentals," he said.
"I'm thinking that some narratives that have been live in the recent past might come back. There was the narrative that began at the beginning of 2018. And in January and February we had a correction and 10 percent decline. And then we had another downturn between September and Christmas Eve last year, and on the S&P 500 it went down from peak to trough 19.8 percent and it almost made this classical definition of a bear market," he said.
"And I think these things weigh on people's mind and there's a sense that maybe it's finished for people who see a buy signal, or maybe it's going to complete the job and go down further."
The term "bear market" on Wall Street is synonymous with serious, long-lasting declines in stock markets. In numeric terms, a bear market is a 20 percent or more drop from a recent peak. The S&P 500 hit that milestone on December 24, dropping 20 percent from its 52-week high. But that was on an intra-day basis and not when taking into account closing prices for the index. Since the start of the year the S&P 500 has risen by around 5 percent.

Investors with a long-term horizong may find it valuable to assess Akzo Nobel N.V.'s (AMS:AKZA) earnings trend over time and against its industry benchmark as opposed to simply looking at a sincle earnings announcement at one point in time. Below is my commentary, albiet very simple and high-level, on how Akzo Nobel is currently performing.
View our latest analysis for Akzo Nobel
How Did AKZA's Recent Performance Stack Up Against Its Past?
AKZA's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 31 March 2019) of €354m has declined by -17% compared to the previous year.
Furthermore, this one-year growth rate has been lower than its average earnings growth rate over the past 5 years of -14%, indicating the rate at which AKZA is growing has slowed down. Why could this be happening? Well, let’s take a look at what’s transpiring with margins and whether the rest of the industry is experiencing the hit as well.
ENXTAM:AKZA Income Statement, June 28th 2019 More
In terms of returns from investment, Akzo Nobel has fallen short of achieving a 20% return on equity (ROE), recording 4.5% instead. Furthermore, its return on assets (ROA) of 2.7% is below the NL Chemicals industry of 6.1%, indicating Akzo Nobel's are utilized less efficiently. And finally, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for Akzo Nobel’s debt level, has declined over the past 3 years from 14% to 5.1%.
What does this mean?
Though Akzo Nobel's past data is helpful, it is only one aspect of my investment thesis. Companies that are profitable, but have unpredictable earnings, can have many factors influencing its business.

Columbia University Economics Professor Joseph Stiglitz, a long time financial transparency advocate who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2001 says cryptocurrencies function poorly as currencies, push economic activity underground and, for these reasons, should be “shut down.”
Stiglitz made the comments in an interview at CNBC.
Stiglitz began by laying out an argument for how comprehensive data from an electronic money network would aid in regulating the economy:
“I’ve been a great advocate of moving to an electronic payments mechanism. There are lots of efficiencies. I think we can actually have a better-regulated economy. If we had all the data in real time knowing what people are spending, it would enable the Federal Reserve to actually set interest rates in a much more efficient way. We would have…better macroeconomic management.”
Cryptocurrency adoption, says Stiglitz, moves the economy in the opposite direction:
“It also would curb some of the illicit economic activities and it disturbed me a great deal the attention that was given to cryptocurrencies cuz those were moving things off of a transparent platform onto a dark platform.”
Money-laundering is already a problem, said Stiglitz, with massive wealth already sitting in “dark havens”:
“We know about the role of real estate and money laundering. We know from the Panama Papers the extent of this laundering. We know from research in recent years, for instance the work of Gabriel Zucman, the large percentage of global wealth that is held in these dark havens.”
Stiglitz defended the American dollar and the Federal Reserve, both of which are often attacked by cryptocurrency advocates for alleged mismanagement:
“We have a very good currency. So far, the currency has been run in a very stable. There is no need for anybody to go to a cryptocurrency.”
He also said cryptocurrencies do not function well as currencies. Others have made similar claims based on the argument that cryptocurrency networks’ hard-wired supply protocols mean issuance can not be adjusted in order to respond to real-world circumstances:
“In our standard courses in economics, we talk about the attributes of a good currency and the US dollar has all those attributes. Cryptocurrencies do not have those attributes.”
Rather than moving underground, Stiglitz advised that concerned parties work to address how to prevent transparent money from becoming surveillance money:
“If we want a more efficient economy, without these illicit activities, I think we are going to have to move to more of an electronic payments mechanism we are going to have to figure out to have the transparency of the electronic payments mechanism without the dangers of the surveillance and the surveillance state.
Stiglitz ended his comments unequivocally:
“I actually think we should shut down the cryptocurrencies.”
Cryptocurrency advocates were quick to ridicule Stiglitz and other economists and bankers who have called out the sector:

According to Encyclopedia Britannica, Joseph Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2001 for his work, “…laying the foundations for the theory of markets with asymmetric information.”
Stiglitz’s work has been applied to improve accuracy in insurance markets:
“Stiglitz’s research concentrated on what could be done by ill-informed individuals and operators to improve their position in a market with asymmetric information. He found that they could extract information indirectly through screening and self-selection. This point was illustrated through his study of the insurance market, in which (uninformed) insurance companies lacked information on the individual risk situation of their (informed) customers. The analysis showed that by offering incentives to policyholders to disclose information, insurance companies were able to divide them into different risk classes.The use of a screening process enabled companies to issue a choice of policy contracts in which lower premiums could be exchanged for higher deductibles.”

HONG KONG — The first day of the 2019 Global Biotechnology Week was co-sponsored by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the China Great Bay Area District Common Residential Investment Co., Ltd. and Ausvic Capital (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. The Nobel and Turing Award winners Hong Kong Summit officially launched this afternoon. Leaders from the global biotechnology community gathered in the Hong Kong Financial Hall, including biotech-related Nobel Prize, Turing Award, Fields Prize winner. Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Li Xiaojia, Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Group, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dawan District Common Home Investment Co., Ltd. and Chairman of China Resources Group, Dr. Fu Yuning, and Founding Partner of Ausvic Capital, Chen Pingjun Participated in the event and delivered a wonderful speech at the summit.
Li Xiaojia believed that in the field of biotechnology, no matter which country he or she comes from, there is only one common enemy of “disease”.
Mr. Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong has an advantage in biotechnology and would work hard to promote biotechnology.
Dr. Fu Yuying said that Hong Kong should attract and promote exchanges and exchanges between experts and investors in the field of biotechnology, and jointly promote scientific and technological progress for the benefit of mankind and the world.
Nobel Laureate Professor Aaron Ciechanover gave a keynote speech on personalized medicine. He believed that the future would be an era of precision medicine. Based on personalized medicine and combined with genome sequencing technology, proteomics technology would develop more “appropriate” prevention, diagnosis and treatment options for the human body. The Turing Award Winner Professor Joseph Sifakis elaborated on the opportunities and threats in the knowledge revolution. He said that the role of artificial intelligence depended mainly on human choice. The long-term approach to challenging artificial intelligence was to build the next generation of autonomous systems.
In addition, Chen Ping, founding partner of Ausvic Capital, one of the organizers of the first day of the summit, delivered a wonderful speech at the summit. He said that Ausvic Capital attached great importance to the academic research and application of science and technology. In the future, Ausvic will focus on investing in biotechnology in combination with its own high-quality resources to promote the development of cutting-edge biotechnology for the benefit of mankind. At the same time, work intensively with world award winners and work closely with individual world-class funds;
Chen Ping believed that with the global economic slowdown, the purchasing rate will decline in the next 10 years, and only a new generation of technology will have an opportunity. Hong Kong should seize the opportunity of this technological change. Therefore, I would like to make the following recommendations to the Hong Kong Government:
1. In Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Certification;
2. Focus on the introduction of world-class scientific and technological talents and build a world-class technology port. The establishment of a world-class authority for new drug approval departments will make Hong Kong a standardizer for biotechnology and will affect the future of Hong Kong.
At the third round table, scientists had a wonderful discussion on “the future of biotechnology.” The round table was chaired by Professor Harvey Lodish, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. The winners of the round table include:
Professor Aaron Ciechanover, winner of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
Professor Ada E. Yonath, winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
Professor Joseph Sifakis, winner of the 2007 Turing Awards
Professor Caucher Birkar, winner of the 2018 Fields Prize
Everyone is talking about the future of biotechnology, which benefits participants and everyone is thunderous.
As one of the four clear new economic drivers of the Hong Kong government, the success of the summit will accelerate the development of Hong Kong’s biotechnology industry and further improve the investment and financing environment of biotechnology in Hong Kong. At the same time, it will help investors to understand the cutting-edge technologies and industrial development policies of biomedical innovation and promote the healthy development of human beings.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Nobel Peace Prize-winning surgeon whose hospital in war-torn Congo has treated over 50,000 victims of sexual violence has launched a fund with the goal of providing reparations for survivors of conflicts around the world.
Dr. Denis Mukwege said in an interview Saturday that he and his team at Panzi Hospital in eastern Bukavu province could physically and mentally help victims of rape and other abuse, but that the only way to really heal survivors is for society to accept the wrong that was done to them through reparations.
Legal action can be taken against an alleged perpetrator, he said, but even in cases in which women win, “there is no reparation.”
Mukwege said reparations can be individual or collective, symbolic or financial, depending on the victim, the case and the context.
“In some cases, women are just asking us to ask the leaders to ... say, ‘I apologize for what just happened to you because I was maybe the leader in this place and I didn’t protect you,’” Mukwege said. “Then maybe for the women, this can be enough.”
But in other cases, women might want financial reparations to support them, to pay for school, or to return to previous activities or start new ones, he said, “so this fund really works in different ways, depending with the conflicts.”
“For 10 years I was fighting to get a global fund,” Mukwege said, “because ... what is happening in Congo is happening everywhere where we have conflict.”
The fund is trying to get governments and the private sector to give money, he said, but its board will also include victims of sexual violence and civil society representatives.
France is the first country to commit to the fund, pledging $2 million a year for three years in an important show of support, Mukwege said.
Mukwege is in New York on a tour organized by Doctors of the World, a longtime funder of the Panzi Hospital. It will also take him to California and Washington state to talk to foundations about the fund.
Mukwege is also planning to meet several world leaders and attend events on the sidelines of the upcoming annual gathering of presidents, prime ministers and monarchs at the U.N. General Assembly.
Female victims around the world face similar challenges, Mukwege said, and he has recently seen how sexual violence survivors from the Bosnian war have overcome their problems, “and how they can help Congolese women to help face this big problem.”
He also traveled to South Korea to see the “comfort women” used as sex slaves by Japanese soldiers in World War II and visited Colombia and victims of that country’s long civil war. He plans to start programs for victims of sexual violence in the Central African Republic and Burundi, he said.
Mukwege shared the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize with Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman who was raped by Islamic State militants in Iraq and has become a global advocate for victims of sexual violence.
“She and I are working together,” he said. “I was in Iraq to see exactly what was happening there, and I hope that this year, I will start to support Yazidi women.”
The program will operate in different camps where the Yazidis are, not in the Sinjar region where Islamic State extremists stormed Yazidi communities in 2014, Mukwege said.
Having spent much of his life treating female victims of sexual violence, Mukwege said, “today my policy is to work more with men because I think that it is very important in talking about a positive masculinity.”
“We are really in a patriarchal system where men dominate everything and women are treated just as objects,” he said. “We need to change our way to treat women and see women in our society and ... let young boys grow up to respect women and understand that women are equal to men — and this has to start very early.”

‘[Trump] will surely try to stick to his public narrative, which has worked so well for so long. But a severe recession may be his undoing. And even before economic catastrophe strikes, the public may begin paying more attention to his aberrations — and to contagious new counter-narratives that crowd out his own.’
That’s Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller explaining in an editorial for the Guardian published on Monday how a downturn in the economy could be what finally marks the ruin of Trump’s turbulent presidency.
“During a recession, people pull back and reassess their views. Consumers spend less, avoiding purchases that can be postponed: a new car, home renovations and expensive holidays,” Shiller continued. “Businesses spend less on new factories and equipment, and put off recruiting.”
The “public narrative” he was referring to is Trump’s lifetime pursuit of putting his glam life on display for everybody to see and aspire to — fancy cars, beautiful women, private jets, gold toilets. Look at me, I’m rich and you can be, too!
That, Shiller says, has less appeal when the economy goes belly up.
“Now that Trump has established a contagious narrative, he continues to live out his TV show persona,” he wrote, adding that this approach is nothing new. In fact, it dates back thousands of years. He quoted the ancient cynic Lucian of Samosata, who told would-be leaders of the era how to exploit “the power narrative”:
In your private life, be resolved to do anything and everything, to dice, to drink deep, to live high and keep mistresses, or at all events to boast of it even if you do not do it, telling everyone about it and showing notes that purport to be written by women. You must aim to be elegant, you know, and take pains to create the impression that women are devoted to you. This also will be set down to the credit of your rhetoric by the public, who will infer from it that your fame extends even to the women’s quarters.
This has worked for Trump during his presidency, Shiller says, but only because the economy has been exceptionally strong, with the U.S. expansion the longest on record going back to the 1850s.
“So far, with his flashy lifestyle, Trump has been a resounding inspiration to many consumers and investors,” Shiller wrote. “But motivational speakers often end up repelling the very people they once inspired.”
An ailing stock market certainly won’t help Trump’s chances in 2020, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.43% has been all over the place lately. On Tuesday, the blue-chip index was down more than 300 points.

It's time for new thinking from this so-called Nobel prize.
Pictured: Nobel Prize laureates (Flickr).
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics will be 50 years old next month. One thing unites all its winners, bar one: they have all been male.
This is not just an affront to equality. In overlooking brilliant female economists, the Swedish Central Bank’s Nobel has neglected economic theory which could have helped prevent the turmoil of regular financial shocks and political trauma.
The outstanding female economists passed over by the Nobel Foundation have often understood the social nature of money and credit as a social construct more profoundly than male economists crowding the world stage. And yet, they have rarely been recognised, never mind celebrated. That must change.
The greatest economist, regardless of gender, never to win a Nobel is Joan Robinson. The economics textbooks I studied as a young South African student in 1960s, written by Nobel-winner Paul Samuelson, made no sense of the racialised capitalist system I lived under. And, then I discovered Robinson’s Economic Philosophy. I still recommend it to today’s young economic writers and students.
In a clear, brilliant and often witty style Robinson – a Cambridge professor and ally of John Maynard Keynes – argued that however much economists shun ideology, ethics and morals, they cannot escape them. Independent and outspoken, she explained that the purpose of studying economics is simply to avoid being deceived by economists. She dismissed micro-economists obsessed with mathematical modelling: “I never learned maths” she wrote,” so I had to think.”
Decades after her death, she remains a major figure. Her analyses of monopolies and monopsony (where there is only one buyer in a market) were remarkably original. The Nobel Factor analysis shows that if you ranked by the number of citations all Nobel Memorial Prize winners in economics, only ten winners would rank above her, the other seventy-one males rank below.
Robinson was repeatedly nominated for the prize. She was held in high esteem by the mainstream American economists, with whom she often clashed. She taught two future Nobel winners in economics: Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz. Many people expected 1975 to be her year. Business Week said that she was “on everyone’s list for this year’s Nobel Prize in Economics”. But the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences missed that opportunity, and alas, never regained it.
Robinson’s exclusion may also have been due to her left-wing views, but it was undoubtedly sexism too. And, hers is not an isolated case. Many other brilliant women have been kept out of the biggest prize in economics.
There’s the late Susan Strange the architect of the academic field of international political economy, whose book Casino Capitalism was well ahead of its time. Victoria Chick, a formidable and outstanding macroeconomist and monetary theorist. Then there’s underrated Cheryl Payer who wrote The Debt Trap that had a significant impact on me, and on other economists working on the issue of sovereign debt.
What is really important about the work of all of these women is that they all understand the nature of money and the monetary system. They have a profound understanding of debt and credit and its role within the economy.
The general ignorance of the nature of credit and banking among most economists – who persist in the belief that banks are ‘intermediaries between impatient borrowers and patient savers’ helps explain the recurrence of financial crises. That ignorance is why it is so important that these women are acknowledged and celebrated.
Until we do, citizens, entrepreneurs, workers and capitalists will continue to be confronted with the consequences of today’s flawed neoclassical economics: increasingly frequent financial crises; economic failure and the resulting political blowback: Brexit and Trump.
The Nobel Foundation can do better. Seventeen women have won a Nobel Peace Prize, fourteen have won in Literature, and a dozen in Medicine. There are many brilliant female economists working and writing today: just look at the outstanding work of Mariana Mazzucato. Why has only one woman ever won in economics?!
A silver lining of sorts is that even without the Nobel, Robinson has not been forgotten. One of the big trends of recent years has been the prospect of the break-up of big tech giants: Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. Joan Robinson’s theory of monopolistic competition is at the cutting edge of the debate and was cited earlier this year in a major US Supreme Court decision on Apple’s domination of the app market.
It’s time to reboot the Nobel and upgrade it with some fresh economic thinking – by women.

ATLANTA, Aug. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The Greater Women's Business Council (GWBC), the leading provider of certification and development resources for women business enterprises (WBEs) in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, has secured Dr. Shawne Duperon as keynote speaker for its 2019 Power of Partnering (POP) Marketplace conference, an annual event that brings together hundreds of women entrepreneurs, business leaders, corporations and procurement professionals.
Dr. Duperon, a six-time Emmy winner and Nobel Peace Prize nominee for her global work on forgiveness through Project Forgive, is considered one of the most innovative speakers and consultants on business engagement and retention today.
"GWBC's Power of Partnering conference brings together a group of dynamic women in business with our corporate partners, and we can't think of a better speaker to address our audience than Dr. Shawne Duperon," said Roz Lewis, president and CEO of GWBC. "Dr. Duperon's innovative teachings on forgiveness as a leadership skill are game-changing, and during her keynote she'll demonstrate how 'accepting the apology you'll never receive' will increase engagement, agility, loyalty, respect and incredible conversations in the workplace."
Dr. Duperon created Project Forgive, a non-profit and non-religious educational foundation, to make an impact on physical and emotional health through the practice and skill of forgiveness. The foundation offers business-related programs focused on tolerance, inclusion and acceptance as well as initiatives for veteran-owned businesses and kids at risk in the juvenile justice system.
As a scholar, Dr. Duperon's expertise is leading edge. Applying gossip theory, her disruptive strategies caused Project Forgive to go viral, garnering an endorsement from Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the honor of a 2016 Nobel Peace Prize Nomination for her work on global leadership.
"Forgiveness truly is a leadership skill that will lead toward smarter risk-taking and powerful choices that can help grow your business, your career and ultimately yourself," said Dr. Duperon. "Leaders take risks and inevitably will make mistakes. How quickly you forgive yourself has a huge impact on getting back to the place of being an extraordinary leader."

The U.S. economy has been a bright spot among advanced economies over the past year, partly thanks to higher corporate investment that followed Trump's tax cuts. But such an effect will only last for another two years at the maximum, said Edmund Phelps, a professor at Columbia University.
The $1.5 trillion tax reform initiated by U.S. President Donald Trump in 2017 has boosted the American economy, but the positive effect of lower corporate and individual taxes can only last so long, according to a Nobel-winning economist.
I would be surprised if the elevated level of investment continues much longer. Maybe another year, maximum two years.
"We're in a boom, but all booms come to an end. This high level of output and employment cannot be sustained," he told CNBC's Martin Soong on Sunday at the China Development Forum in Beijing.
Phelps won the 2006 Nobel in economics for his work on the short-run and long-run effects of economic policy.
"I would be surprised if the elevated level of investment continues much longer. Maybe another year, maximum two years," he said. "Then, I think we're going to subside to a more normal level of employment and unemployment."
The U.S. Federal Reserve has warned that the United States grow at a slower pace this year than last.
The central bank said weakening European and Chinese economies are dampening U.S. growth. It estimated that the American economy would grow by 2.1 percent this year, down from an earlier forecast of 2.3 percent and last year's 2.9 percent.
Some analysts have even predicted that the U.S. could be in recession by the middle of next year.

Yield curve briefly inverted again with two-year Treasury yield topped 10-year yield in the past two weeks. (Image: Bloomberg)
Even as the market experts have been talking about the US economy staring at a possible recession after its yield curve briefly inverted again with two-year Treasury yield topped 10-year yield in the past two weeks, Nobel-winning economist and Yale University professor Robert Shiller doesn’t feel convinced about it to be the real indicator for a likely slowdown. Instead, he said that public panic may be the actual indicator of the next downturn. Yield curve inversion, according to Investopedia, refers to an interest rate environment wherein long-term debt instruments have a lower yield than short-term debt instruments of the same credit quality and looked at as an indicator of the recession in an economy.
Shiller said that while the curve is a “well-known leading indicator,” but he is “not as confident in it as others are,” as told to CNBC Make It. In fact, Chiller called for analysts to mine data to look for any indicators that have stayed for some time. Importantly, the yield curve is assumed to be a strong signal of a recession ahead it can hold itself up whereas both inverted curves of the two-year to 10-year yield have been brief. Also, while the curve has preceded every recession since the 1950s, with only one false positive, the data set is quite small to be actually conclusive.
Nonetheless, the economist didn’t completely deny the expected downturn in the market particularly when you incorporate the public’s reaction to the inversions of late. A lot of what happens with the markets is a “self-fulfilling prophecy,” Shiller said, however, investors should not panic assuming a recession to begin tomorrow. There has been a 17-month lag on average between the inverted curve happening and the last five recessions, according to research from Ben Carlson of Ritholtz Wealth Management.
Experts believe that for young investors, the best strategy currently is to continue investing and making regular contributions to their retirement savings plan every two weeks. This is great for long-term investors because it keeps long-term investors from selling out during market lows and buying at the time of market highs.

If President Donald Trump wins a second term, it could prolong the bull market and delay a recession, Nobel laureate Robert Shiller says.
Shiller, who is known for his behavioral finance research, believes the president's pro-business policies would resonate with Wall Street for another four years.
"It also seems likely that when Jerome Powell's term as Fed chairman expires, he'll bring someone in that he controls more, and bring someone who can stimulate the economy without worrying," the Yale University economics professor said Monday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "It's also that Trump is a model for extravagant living and big spending. All these things are boosting of the stock market."
A weekend report by Goldman Sachs economists said Trump has a "narrow advantage" in the 2020 election. Not only did it find incumbents generally have a built in bonus of 5 to 6 percentage points in the popular vote, the economy's relatively strong performance ahead of the election bodes well for the president.
Since Trump won the presidency in November 2016, the Dow and and Dow have rallied 44% and 35%, respectively. Along the way, there were corrections in February 2018 and December 2018. But Shiller points out the subsequent rebounds were encouraging — at least to a certain extent.

"It's the question of how people look back at the recent correction," he said. "There's another narrative that says these things are precursors to a bigger event."
That's where his economic and market outlook gets cloudy. Shiller, who has been making comparisons to the excesses of the Roaring '20s and the current bull market, is still on recession watch. He lists a contraction as a top risk to the market.
On "Trading Nation" in early March, Shiller gave a 50 percent chance the economy would tip into a recession within 18 months. He cited increasing recession jitters among investors materializing into a painful self-fulfilling prophecy.
"We're past the days where we felt very secure. We had very low volatility for a while," Shiller said. "We're now in a period where we've been shaken. We're pulling ourselves together and we have to see where it goes from here."

The FT has been given access to one of the most sophisticated research facilities in the world, a laboratory so successful that it's been called a Nobel Prize factory.
This is the MRC's Laboratory of Molecular Biology.
The LMB, as it's known for short, has won 12 Nobels in total, more than any other institution of its size. So what's the secret of the lab's success? We're here to ask some of its leading scientists first-hand.
If I knew what the secret sauce of this place is, I would be very rich and very famous. Unfortunately, I don't. But one of the properties of this lab that makes it a bit maverick is the trust and engagement with risky science and long-term science that we believe delivers the goods, in the end.
One of the most audacious projects that the LMB is led by Madeline Lancaster. Her team are encouraging stem cells to grow into clusters of human brain tissue, sometimes referred to as mini-brains.
These are basically 3D neural tissues that model the the developing...
May I have a look?
...human brain. Yes, of course. The really special aspect is that they are self-organising. So we're not coming in and forcing the cells to make specific cell types. We're allowing these tissues to develop on their own. Also, of course, in a three dimensional conformation, which is the way the brain develops naturally.
Using this technique, Madeline can study the way in which healthy cells arrange themselves within the embryonic brain. She can even look at how neurons fire interactivity.
I think, generally, if you understand how something is built, then you'll also understand more about how that works. And so that's kind of the goal here, is to try to let these things build themselves, and we can watch that process and learn something about human brain development, and also what goes wrong in neurological conditions.
Madeline's method may be unusual, but bold approaches like hers have led to revolutionary work at the LMB. Take her colleague, Richard Henderson. He received the 2017 Nobel Prize for chemistry for his work on cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM.
It's a technique that quickly freezes tiny biological molecules in a very thin layer of ice, preserving their natural structure without the need for unnatural staining.
The images you get are actually images of the molecules themselves in their normal environment, amorphous ice instead of water. And so by recording a stack of images like that, which would be images of the part of the molecule at different angles, in the computer you can process it into a high resolution near-atomic structure.
And so instead of finding the subunit structure - the outline of the molecule in a rough detail - you can actually see right into it and see all the atoms, the amino acids, the DNA, the nucleic acids. It can be used to understand how drugs bind to molecules in biology.
And this is terribly important in drug design, and it will be going to the heart of a number of human physiologies that we need better drugs for.
After more than 20 years of research, cryo-EM has the potential to revolutionise so-called structure-based drug design, making medicines that are more effective with fewer side effects. It's a fantastic example of how long-term investment by the UK's Medical Research Council can translate directly to healthcare. .
And the process is accelerated even further when labs like the LMB work with pharmaceuticals companies, such as AstraZeneca.
To be able to push the boundaries of science, to work at the frontier of science means that we have to employ the best scientists within our laboratories. We have to collaborate and partner with the best scientists globally.
And these partnerships are either to develop new approaches by which we can develop medicines, which we can then take forward to the clinic, or to understand the basic mechanisms of disease.
You're looking at one of the great hopes for understanding how the brain works. It's called a connectome, a map of some of the pathways that information can take as it passes from neuron to neuron.
It's enriching our understanding of behaviour and memory, and it could one day help us find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
Greg, we're looking at a spectacular rotating fly's brain. What's it's showing us?
The big challenge at the moment in trying to understand how brains actually control behaviour is to understand the network of connections within the brain, and how information flows through those networks while the animal is producing a particular behaviour.
And that's true whether you're talking about a fly - which is what we study - a worm, a mouse, or a human.
Even in a fly brain, which is just a millimetre across, Greg's team have a huge task on their hands, tracing the path of individual neurons through stacks of electron microscope images, and then painstakingly recreating all the connections in a computer model.
Greg, what did it take to produce this beautiful picture?
So it took the combined efforts of many different scientists with many expertise, there are contributions for over 150 people in this image. And there's about 30m clicks tracing neurons through this electron microscopy image data, that have turned into this image that we see here.
Good science takes a village. Fortunately, Cambridge is building such a village, the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. It's already home to some 17,000 health professionals and research scientists, and there's space on campus for another 14 Wembley pitches of new developments.
The impetus behind the whole project - collaboration.
Having proximity to other collaborators in the Cambridge cluster is really important. We've got the Royal Papworth, we've got UK buildings, lots of great clinical researchers.
The key is really understanding how we take some of the discoveries that we're building here and really bring them in to general practise. And I think a lot of that is understanding how best to make the right kind of connections, how best to put the right infrastructure and informal networks in place to encourage dialogue.
Thanks to institutes like the LMB, the UK is already a world leader in biomedical research and development. And if the country takes lessons learned from this lab's history, it has the potential to achieve even more success.

Akzo’s strategy is to achieve profitable volume growth rather than chasing higher volumes.
Akzo’s lower than industry decorative paints volume growth in FY19 (mid- to high-single digit vs mid-double digit for competition) was due to its focus on premium products and reduced focus on low-margin bottom-of-the- pyramid products. With an eye on profitability, Akzo aims at innovation and increase in distributor-based network to gain market share over the next few years. Maintain ‘Hold’.
Akzo’s strategy is to achieve profitable volume growth rather than chasing higher volumes. For this, the company targets growth at 1.5x GDP for its premium products and aims to recoup its market share in the mid-category product portfolio.
Akzo has announced price cut of 2-3% in its Dulux Gloss Premium enamel range w.e.f. 7-Jun’19 given its high correlation with crude oil price, which has recently declined. We do not expect a significant impact of the cut on the margins due to the low share of enamels in the overall contribution. Akzo was the only company to have taken a price hike (1.0-1.5%) in Feb’19.
Akzo’s distributor-led model has witnessed good traction. It aims to increase penetration in smaller towns over the next few years by improving supply-chain management and ensure product availability for distributors. In a bid to expand its portfolio, Akzo launched products in the fast- growing waterproofing category under the brand Aquatech. Akzo is the fastest company to reach waterproofing revenues of `1 bn in India. Over the next few years, Akzo intends to gain market share.
We maintain our earnings estimates and expect consolidated sales and earnings CAGRs of 10.1% and 15.1%, respectively, over FY19-FY21E. We maintain our ‘Hold’ rating with a target price of `1,730 (unchanged). At CMP, the stock is trading at a P/E of 29.9x FY21E earnings, the lowest among its peers.

Roughly 100 friends, family members and colleagues of Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert C. Merton gathered in Cambridge, Mass., in early August to celebrate his 75th birthday and his achievements.
At the symposium honoring Mr. Merton, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, attendees read academic papers reflecting the importance of Mr. Merton's scholarly work.
His research focuses on finance theory, covering areas such as life cycle and retirement finance, optimal portfolio selection, capital asset pricing, derivative securities pricing, the dynamics of institutional change, and improving methods of measuring and managing macro-financial systemic risk.
"(Mr.) Merton is quite an important figure in contemporary finance," said Zvi Bodie, professor emeritus at Boston University and a speaker at the event, held at MIT's Samberg Conference Center on Aug. 5 and 6. (Mr. Merton's birthday was July 31.) "He really is the figure who transformed finance into much more of a science," Mr. Bodie said in a phone interview.
Other speakers included Dimensional Fund Advisors co-founder David Booth and fellow Nobel laureates Myron Scholes and Eugene Fama.
"This was a major event," added Mr. Bodie, who in 1970 took the first class Mr. Merton taught. He and Mr. Merton co-authored the textbook "Financial Economics," the second edition of which was published in 2012.
In 1997, Mr. Merton shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Mr. Scholes, for their work on valuing derivatives. Mr. Merton is currently the resident scientist at Dimensional, where he created the global integrated retirement-funding system, Target Retirement Solution.

A Nobel Peace Prize-winning surgeon has launched a fund with the goal of providing reparations for survivors of conflicts around the world.
Dr Denis Mukwege said in an interview on Saturday that he and his team at Panzi Hospital in Congo could physically and mentally help victims of rape and other abuse.
But he says the only way to really heal survivors and to right the wrong that was done to them is through reparations.
He says that legal action can be taken against an alleged perpetrator, but that even when women win, "there is no reparation".
Mukwege says reparations can be individual or collective, symbolic or financial, depending on the victim, the case and the context.
His hospital in war-torn Congo has treated over 50,000 victims of sexual violence.

The microfinance sector is not only helping the poor in rural areas generate some income, but it also promotes entrepreneurship and help them come up as entrepreneurs, says Nobel peace prize winner and founder of Grameen Bank of Bangladesh Muhammad Yunus.
In a free-wheeling interview with CNBC-TV18, Yunus, who is known as a pioneer of the microcredit concept, said the microfinance sector in India would double the size in the next five years and become a significant economic entity.
“Rural areas always provided the labour to the city. I don’t think, after micro credit, that would be the scenario. The scenario will be that they would be dealing with their own economy, building their own economy as entrepreneurs. I think microcredit has transformed the whole idea of what the urban and rural relationship would be,” he observed.
Edited excerpts from the interview:
We would like to talk to you about the overall health of microfinance sector in India. This sector saw a growth of 42 percent in Q1 of FY20. The gross loan portfolio of India’s microfinance industry grew 38 percent in 2018-2019. The number of microfinance accounts grew 21 percent. Are these healthy trends at a time of economic downturn?
That reminds me of 2008, when the whole meltdown happened, everywhere a wave of meltdown; so many journalists asked me about its impact on micro credit. I said microcredit is sound, healthy and flourishing because they are not part of that economy. Their economy they are building up, their own economy, so that meltdown was felt only in big financial centres such as New York, London or Bombay, that kind of thing. Microcredit sector is far away from that and I am very happy they are providing the stability to the economy.
Coming back to the present situation in India, I will say microcredit sector is doing very good and I am very impressed looking at the numbers. They have come a long way, they have gone through lots of ups and downs, the sector has faced many crises. Today they are well-organised and their information flow is very clear. They are up for big changes and you are ready for doubling what you have right now after nearly 30 years of work. In the next five years, the sector will double the size. It will become a significant economic entity in the whole country. So that is where they are, a big change is happening in the rural economy.
Without going into specific issues that the Indian economy is facing what role can microfinance sector play in strengthening the fundamentals of an economy in the India context?
A very important role. It is usually said that it is money going to the poor for starting some income generating activity. Some define it as a kind of self-employment. I said no, self-employment is kind of minimising the importance of the whole thing as if they are job seekers, now they have employed themselves. I said no, you are missing the whole point. They are coming up as entrepreneurs, they are building their own businesses. Even if it is only a $200 loan, they build businesses, they sell something, produce something and plan for the next round, what they want to do and improve. Micro credit is not one-shot credit, it is a series of things, every year, every six months you are getting new loans, you are building up what you have built before. So it is an entrepreneurship that you are building up.
People never looked at the rural poor as materials for entrepreneurship. They usually got for low-income jobs -- either it is an agriculture labour or some industrial labour of low quality -- that is what the rural people usually get. Today it is changed, microcredit has transformed everything. They are emerging as entrepreneurs. Imagine if this generation is coming up as entrepreneurs what their second generation will do. Their second generation will have education, they will have all this learning process they have gone through in the family and they are getting ready for that. So, this is an outburst of an entrepreneurial activity in the rural areas.
Rural areas always provided the labour to the city. I don’t think after micro credit, that would be the scenario. The scenario will be that they would be dealing with their own economy, building their own economy as entrepreneurs, that is what the microcredit has given them. I think microcredit has transformed the whole idea of what the urban and rural relationship would be. Today they are the recipients of foods and other things coming from the cities. Tomorrow they will be producing and be selling to the urban areas because they will be coming to the stage where they will be processing those things, they produce rather than just supply the raw materials.
What are the issues that you see in the micro finance sector here in India, things that need to be improved according to you, a place where the RBI can play a role maybe?
The RBI has played a very important role that I must admire them. They are very patient, they want to make sure that they do it the right way and they did it the right way. Particularly the decision about small finance banks, this is a wonderful decision and NGOs given this licence to become banks for microfinance and then take deposits then that is the whole end of the idea of waiting for donors, waiting for others to give them the money so that they can lend to the poor people. They do it themselves.
The one important thing that the RBI could look at, I am sure they are looking at it but I should say it anyway, is that 80 percent of the money that goes out through the microfinance organisations throughout India comes from the banks, conventional banks. So the conventional banks themselves provide the money to the micro finance, which is good. But my point is why don’t the microfinance organisations given the ability to take deposits, given the licence to take deposits and then take the money.
Usually the rural money goes to conventional banks in the city and then conventional bank giving small amount of money back to the microfinance or coming back to the rural areas. Why can’t rural money stay in the rural area? Give them microcredit people, ability to take deposit and use it for the local people. The entrepreneurship really saluted, really applauded and they see that they can create their own local economy. Local economy dealing with the RBI economy as two partners rather than recipient of things that happen in the urban areas.
Demonetisation and the recent non-banking financial companies crisis have affected the economy. What was the impact of these two issues on the flow of microfinance and do you think the negative impact has been offset now?

-- 19 new Citation Laureates named, from seven countries
-- To date, 50 Citation Laureates have gone on to receive a Nobel Prize, 29 within two years of being listed
LONDON and PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 24, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The Web of Science Group, part of Clarivate Analytics, today named 19 world-class researchers from seven countries as Citation Laureates. These are researchers whose work is deemed to be 'of Nobel class', as demonstrated by analysis carried out by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). ISI analysts examine research publications with very high citation tallies recorded in the Web of Science citation index.
Each year since 2002, ISI analysts have drawn on Web of Science publication and citation data to identify influential researchers in the research areas recognized by Nobel Prizes: Physiology or Medicine, Physics, Chemistry and Economics. Out of some 47 million papers indexed in the Web of Science since 1970, only 4,900 (or .01%) have been cited 2,000 or more times. It is from the authors of this group of papers that Citation Laureates are identified and selected. They are individuals whose research reports are highly cited and whose contributions to science have been extremely influential, even transformative.
In early October 2019, the Nobel Assembly will vote to confer sciences' highest honor. Whilst this annual rite inspires worldwide speculation, the Web of Science Group is the only organization to use quantitative data to provide valuable insights. To date, 50 Citation Laureates have gone on to receive a Nobel Prize, 29 within two years of being listed.
Authors of very highly cited papers (to be cited 2,000 times or more is a rarity) are usually members of national academies of sciences, hold high appointments in universities and other research institutes, and have received many top international prizes in their fields. Many of these 'scientific elites' go on to receive Nobel honors.
This year 10 of the 19 honorees are based at leading academic institutions in the United States; others hail from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
The 2019 Citation Laureates are:
Physiology or Medicine Hans Clevers, Professor in Molecular Genetics at the UMC Utrecht and Utrecht University, the Netherlands; Principal Investigator at the Hubrecht Institute (KNAW) and the Princess Maxima Centre for Pediatric Oncology and Oncode Investigator.

For research exploring the consequences of increasing returns (or network effects) in economic systems. We recognize Arthur for describing how small events and positive feedback loops act over time to lock an economy into the domination of one player out of several possible. Arthur has also combined the new science of complexity research with economics to show how an economy functions when its players face ill-defined problems and an ever-changing system, and are unable to act with perfect rationality. Søren Johansen, Professor Emeritus, Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Katarina Juselius, Professor Emerita, Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. For contributions to econometrics and cointegration analysis. For developing the cointegrated VAR (vector autoregressive) method, which provides a flexible framework to study short- and long-term effects in economic time-series data. The method helps economists avoid confirmation bias in their analyses. Ariel Rubinstein, Professor, School of Economics, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, and Professor, Department of Economics, New York University, New York, United States. For development of formal theoretical economic models and especially models of bounded rationality, including his model of bargaining, which has had profound influence in Economics.
David Pendlebury, Citation Analyst at the Institute for Scientific Information said, "We are honored to add another 19 distinguished academics to the Hall of Citation Laureates this year. This years' Laureates have advanced our understanding of topics as varied as economic growth, cryptography, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer; they have given us new tools to map the human genome, personalize medicine, and test drugs without harming animals. The high number of citations they have gathered throughout their careers is a quantitative narrative of how their discoveries have influenced their peers, the broader scientific community, and the world at large."

Lui Che Woo has no plans to retire just yet. The 89-year-old still controls a property and casino empire that gives him and his family a fortune estimated at almost $15 billion, making him the 88th richest person on the planet. Four years ago, Lui donated $1.2 billion of that wealth to endow his foundation and the LUI Che Woo Prize for World Civilization. The honor is bestowed upon three winners each year and includes a cash award of HK$20 million ($2.56 million), which is more than twice as generous as the Nobel Prize. The award has already been given to 9 laureates for their contributions ranging from sustainable development, the betterment of mankind's welfare to the promotion of positive life attitudes. Lui recently sat for an interview at his office in North Point to discuss his philanthropy and business success.
Philippe Branche: What is your vision for the LUI Che Woo Prize?
Lui Che Woo: In terms of history of prizes, there have been prizes which recognize individuals from disciplines such as chemistry, physics, literature or economy. How the prize is different from other prizes is the aim to recognize proper values or betterments of people. We think that one’s ideology should always be the main focus rather than mechanisms adapted. The Prize also focuses on to three areas: Appreciation and recognition towards sustainability of world resources, determination in betterment of people and the society, last but not least, demonstration of positivity which enables mankind to withstand different challenges. The prize therefore is recognition of the laureates’ noble value and perseverance.
Why did you create this award?
“The initial motivation behind the prize is a marvel of the world. The world has existed for over millions of years. For the past hundred years, we have witnessed some leaps of the world such as technological advancements, and world peace improvements. These leaps should have benefited mankind, thus improved the globe’s situation. We should all be able to enjoy world’s resources in such circumstances. However, there are still gaps and differences between countries. Conflicts and warfare still disrupts in corners of the world. What is the reason behind this?
The question lingered in my mind. My experience of hardship in my early life during the war shaped my beliefs, which leads a book called Lasting Serenity written 30 years ago. In the book, I shared my observation, thoughts and beliefs about the philosophical paradox. Finally, I established the LUI Che Woo Prize—my answers to these paradoxes. With positive energy, care for mankind and sustainability of resources, we can all enjoy the world harmoniously.”
K. Wah Group
You previously mentioned some of the hardships you had to face in your early life during the war, can you tell us more about that period?
I lived thorough World War II. It was chaotic not only China, but also the whole world. I saw famines, refugee crisis… And even nowadays, we can still find such tragedies in less developed countries, such as Iraq and Syria. From my point of view, I simply wished the world to be peaceful and respectful. We should preserve the environment and nature, for the sake of all of humanity. These experiences consolidated my wish to establish the prize, in order to advocate three objectives: sustainable development of the world, betterment of the welfare of mankind, and promotion of positive life attitude as well as an enhancement of positive energy.
The prize has a selection process that is structured for three rounds of evaluation, and the council members include Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn of Thailand and former World Bank President Sir James D. Wolfensohn.
Moving to more personal questions, as one of the most recognized billionaires in Asia, what has been your secret for business success?
I was born in a middle-class family with love from my family members. As warfare broke out, I was brought into chaos. I saw peoples who suffer from hardship and starvation due to war. But my journey of becoming an entrepreneur was not held back by such limitations. My perseverance and determination finally led to satisfaction. Despite ups and downs, I still believe that I was consolidated and gifted by the society, so I should not forget to give thanks and contribute back to the society. I did not start my philanthropy only by establishing the prize, but started much earlier. I started giving out donations to primary education, to disciplined services and much more. Despite challenges and hardship we might experience and suffer from, I believe that even the poorest one should never give up as we all have to keep going. If we were born wealthy and luxurious, we should be humble and help those in need. So I established the prize, to recognize those spirits and encourage those with positivity.
From a broader perspective, what is the most important thing according to you?
Some said health is the most important, but I believe peace and calm in our heart should be the most important. With peace and calm, we will be able to help people around us psychologically. Health or wealth can’t be brought to the afterlife, or be extended to our next life. To conclude, I think tranquility is a priority, as it allows us to glimpse through ours and each other’s life.
Is there a book that you would recommend?
I have been working since I was young, and therefore had very limited time to read. But still I applied principles and philosophies read from my limited book selections. I’ve kept them in my heart, and they nourished me throughout my life’s journey. We should first make our own living, and then try to help people around us. Other than that, we should remember our role in the society, hope for the best for the community and try to satisfy the needs of the society by donating to educational services and welfare services.
The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

LONDON, May 30, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Nadia Murad will be at Church House near Westminster at 6.30pm on 11th June 2019 to unveil a statue to honour all victims of sexual violence. Nadia will be joined by VIP guests from the UK Parliament as part of this historic event.
Nadia Murad, 2018 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, said:
"I support recent efforts by the Vietnamese victims of sexual violence to seek recognition and justice. On June 11th, I look forward to meeting with the victims and hearing their stories first-hand."
Jack Straw, former UK foreign secretary and international ambassador for JLDH, said:
"The JLDH statue is a fitting tribute to all victims of sexual violence, and especially the Lai Dai Han and their mothers who have for so long been crying out for recognition. For too long these victims of sexual violence have been forgotten and cast aside by society."
ABOUT THE LAI DAI HAN
The "Lai Dai Han" are the tens of thousands of children of Vietnamese women that were allegedly raped by South Korean soldiers during the Vietnam War. Between 1964 and 1973, some 320,000 South Korean soldiers were deployed to Vietnam to fight alongside the United States.
Justice for Lai Dai Han gives a voice to the victims and their children and campaigns for South Korea to recognise and investigate the allegations of widespread rape and sexual violence.
Justice for Lai Dai Han works with policy makers, writers and artists to ensure this injustice is recognised, alongside fundraising efforts on behalf of the Lai Dai Han and their families.
Justice for Lai Dai Han's work seeks to raise public awareness, to allow political and community leaders to connect with the victims of sexual violence to understand their suffering first hand, and to create public art as a permanent reminder of the Lai Dai Han.

Lars Hansen is an expert on the future. Or, more precisely, what we don’t know about the future. The University of Chicago economist is famous for his work on uncertainty in the macroeconomy and financial markets (and the links between them). He won the Nobel Prize in 2013 for his work in this area.
His insights are particularly relevant now, as the world feels more uncertain that ever: technology is changing work as we know it, the fractious political climate adds a layer of unpredictability to everything, and despite booming economic indicators, many people feel left behind. Economists use models—mathematical descriptions that attempt to quantify what might happen in the future—to offer guidance on what to expect and how to plan. They are the road maps to navigating an uncertain future.
Hansen, as his name reveals, has deep Scandinavian roots. His great-great grandparents settled in Utah where his family lived for generations. Hansen says he was not a great high school student, but once at college at Utah State he applied himself and excelled. He went on to earn his PhD in economics at the University of Minnesota, a program notorious for using arcane mathematical methods.
Over the course of his career Hansen developed economic models that are widely used by economists and financial engineers, and his groundbreaking work focuses on the role that uncertainty plays in models. It is very technical, which is one reason why his work is less known to non-economists compared with the other members of his class of Nobel economic laureates, Robert Schiller and Gene Fama. But to experts who try to make sense of the economy and financial markets, the tools Hansen has developed are invaluable. As the increasingly sprawling and complex financial world appears to make less sense, Hansen’s work helps us understand how to think about the future.
An introvert with a childhood speech impediment he worked to overcome, Hansen never relished the spot light. But winning the Nobel prize changed his life. He says on his website, “Because of the prize, I suddenly began receiving more attention. I tell people, I’m the same person I was before the prize. But somehow you’re treated differently, as if your IQ just jumped by 40 points. So that part of the experience was interesting along some dimensions. I go to public events now and people want to talk to me, but before, they were happy to ignore me. And that’s okay. I think it’s an opportunity, too.”
Following the global financial crisis, many are skeptical that economic models, intended to offer clarity, provide much value. Some think they may even do harm. How does Hansen feel about this? Quartz asked him about how to make sense of the uncertainty around us, and the limits of what we can measure and, ultimately, know.
Quartz: “Uncertainty” is a big, broad concept. How do you break it down?

Hansen: From a modeling perspective, I find it advantageous to distinguish the three components to uncertainty.
First, uncertainty within a model, which I and others call “risk.” My favorite example of a so-called “risk model” is rolling dice or flipping coins: we don’t know outcomes but we know probabilities. This component is the one we typically feature in economic analyses.
Second, there is uncertainty about which among a collection of possible models is the best one, which I call “ambiguity.” Take the idea of secular stagnation. Some models say we may be in a situation of permanent secular stagnation, whereby we had these wonderful economic growth rates in the past, but going forward we just can’t expect that to occur. Others might argue that, yes, we’ve had a short-term downturn, and obviously the financial crisis was a bad experience, although we’re already seeing a recovery out of it. These represent two different viewpoints—or models—but we’re not sure what’s the right one. Maybe we’re in secular stagnation or maybe we’re not. In some sense both are wrong, but you have to assess that.
Third, there is uncertainty about how models might be flawed or misspecified. This component is the most difficult to wrestle with, but may also be the most important one when understanding decision making. All models, by their nature, are wrong because they are necessarily simplifications and abstractions. But some provide valuable insights and guidance for making smart decisions. Assessing how models might be wrong is an important part of uncertainty analysis.
Do these three components impact markets in different ways?
Usually when we talk about financial markets, we use the term “risk.” So empirical finance people are going out and measuring risk premia, [the price financial markets put on risk], the press talk about markets being risk-averse or the like, and all use the language of the first component of uncertainty.
In a more complex environment, investors have to struggle with forming the right viewpoint going forward. Is now a good time to make investments that will have productive payouts over the next 10 or 15 years? They have to speculate about what’s going on with the macroeconomy.
Can you give me an example?
One example I like to use is to suppose we are thinking about economic growth. We are uncertain about technological progress or secular stagnation or the like. And you ask yourself, am I in a good or bad growth state? One model tells you growth is persistent and the other tells you it is not very persistent. If I am in bad times, what I fear is persistence. If I am in good times, what I fear is a lack of persistence, because I want to the good time to carry on.
Or, if I am someone deciding go to graduate school, I am picking something I have a passion for, but I also want employment opportunities in the future. Part of what I wrestle with is how to make guesses about job prospects.
And once I change the story and people aren’t sure what the right model is (or more generally, viewpoint or perspective), so their perception of models change over time, it adds a new dynamic in the behavior of how markets work.
There is so much uncertainty about the future economy and yet not a lot of volatility in markets. Can the way we measure risk explain why?
The question is over what horizons do market measures of volatility capture uncertainty. A lot of the important uncertainties don’t get resolved very quickly, and so as a consequence you don’t see big responses in market volatility. If you we’re looking at things that are going to play out over decades, I am not sure how quickly that will translate into the VIX [a measure of risk a few months ahead]; financial measures of volatility only get a piece of the uncertainty we are talking about. They are interesting barometers but there are big pieces they will not pick up on.
Do you think the financial crisis made people less confident in their models?
Yes, I hope they did! It should have made macro economists less confident, too. I hope we all learned a lesson.
How can we manage the fragility that uncertainty creates?
“Manage” it is a strong term. I wish I knew. Using economic models in naïve ways was a mistake going into the financial crisis for both macroeconomists and financial analysts. Hopefully we’ve learned that lesson. We must try to think more about broader consequences of uncertainty and how to be more sensible about it.
It is also important to have government policies that don’t unnecessarily add to it or exacerbate it. It can be counterproductive to have the private sector speculate about what the government will do next. The private sector doesn’t want to speculate about what the government will do next, making that part more predictable.
Many people critique economic models for being unrealistic, especially about how they model people’s behavior. Does this mean economic models need a serious overhaul?
I am not advocating a whole chucking and throwing away of models. I want to replace models with improved models that offer powerful and tractable insights. I think a lot of earlier generation macro models by construction had uncertainty play minor role. I believe it is important to push away from that notion, and make it a first order.
A lot of the criticism of models I’ve seen is too superficial. Of course, a model is a simplification or abstraction, and not a perfect description of reality. When are those mistakes consequential to the question at hand? When do those mistakes impact the quantitative outcome? Models are always wrong, but they guide our thinking. How do we use them in a smart way?
The hope is that big data and machine learning will offer even more accurate risk measurements, for both companies and individuals, who before couldn’t quantify risks precisely. Could this mean we can expect less uncertainty in markets in the future?
Data seldom, if ever, speaks for itself. To use data effectively requires valid and revealing conceptual frameworks for understanding and interpreting patterns in data. Uncertainty as confronted by decision makers necessarily includes challenges for how best to use data in insightful ways.
When economists do policy, they like to do counterfactual analysis: they study what would happen hypothetically if this policy were in place rather than this other one. If you are looking at policy especially in this dynamic context, you push away from where the data is. You have to do that through economic analysis. You can’t let the data speak along all dimensions. You need an underlying intellectual framework that helps you do this policy or counter-factual analysis.
Acknowledging uncertainty is hard for many people, especially policymakers. Lately it seems like, outside of academic economics, adherence to one kind of economic model to solve every problem is a litmus test of ideological purity. Are we doomed forever to see leaders ignore complexity and feign certainty for political gains?
This is a terrific question that I wish I had a great answer to. I do worry when political leaders want fully confident narratives to justify the policies they implement. This seeming confidence entails a pretense of knowledge that is not supported by scientific evidence.
One could argue that if the policy to be implemented is a wise one, why not defend it with an ex-post narrative, as a version of Plato’s noble falsehood, to gain public confidence in it? This, of course, begs the question of how to determine the wise course of action to begin with. Moreover, the excessive confidence in our projected understanding over the longer term erodes public trust in the messages from policymakers and from their advisors.
The best hope is for an informed public to accept the fact that although our knowledge base may be limited on some important matters of concern, we may still be able to construct sensible policies that acknowledge the underlying uncertainty in our understanding. The resulting policy analyses seek courses of action that remain prudent over the potential models or perspectives that have conceptual and empirical credibility.
Complexity also comes into play. It may well be that even though the social and economic problems we confront are complex, the wise course of action is simple and avoids adding to the uncertainties confronted by the private sector.
More recently, you have been thinking about another source of long-term uncertainty: climate change. How can your work help us understand the problem better, and what we can do about it?
Potential climate change both impacts and is impacted by economic activity. While there is a substantial body of evidence documenting these interactions, there remain substantial limits to our quantitative knowledge of how this interaction will play out over time. My research is in its early stages, but I am optimistic that we can progress as we wrestle with climate uncertainty.
One naïve but unproductive reaction to our work is a fear that a lack of precise knowledge will imply inaction until we have a more complete and precise quantification. This is not an implication of decision theory under uncertainty. The possibility of very bad outcomes can suffice to justify addressing the problem now when it may be less costly to do so. My hope is that a more exposed and realistic treatment of uncertainty can contribute to productive policymaking.

Two Nobel Prizes in Literature will be awarded this year, the Nobel Foundation announced in a statement on Tuesday.
The literature prize, usually annual, was not awarded last year because the body that chooses the winner, the Swedish Academy, was hit by a scandal involving sexual abuse, accusations of financial wrongdoing and hints of a cover-up.
At the center of the scandal were the poet Katarina Frostenson, a member of the academy, and her husband, Jean-Claude Arnault, who together ran a cultural organization in Stockholm that received sizable payments from the academy. Mr. Arnault was accused of abusing the influence the organization gave him, and of groping, harassing and assaulting at least 18 women.
Mr. Arnault, who was convicted of rape last year and sentenced to at least two years in prison, was also accused of leaking the names of award winners.

US President Donald Trump on September 23 said that it is unfair he never got the Nobel peace prize.
"I would get a Nobel prize for a lot of things, if they give it out fairly, which they don't," he complained.
Trump went on to raise the surprise awarding of the one of the world's most prestigious accolades in 2009 to his predecessor in the White House Barack Obama.
Obama was given the peace prize for "extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between people," even though he had only just become president.
"They gave one to Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency and he had no idea why he got it. You know what? That was the only thing I agreed with him on," Trump said.

MONTREAL — Two of Canada’s artificial intelligence pioneers are warning about the consequences of AI in robotic weapons and outsourcing lethal decisions to machines, calling for an international agreement on its deployment as Canada marches toward the binary battlefield.
Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who along with computer scientist Yann LeCun won the Turing Award on Wednesday — known as the Nobel Prize of the technology industry — say so-called weaponized AI and killer robots could spell danger for civilians.
“I think we need to worry about lethal autonomous weapons,” said Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto and a senior researcher at Google Brain.
“Those are things that aren’t a worry about the distant future; those are things that are coming now. The technology is already capable of producing these things and they’re desperately in need of regulation.”
Hinton compared robotic weapons such as drones with land mines, which were banned in a 1997 international treaty. “They’re very stupid, but they’re lethal and they’re autonomous,” he said of the explosives.
Facial recognition technology and other forms of computer vision or surveillance could soon be deployed to identify individuals or locations for drone strikes, said Bengio, a professor at the Universite de Montreal.
“You could basically select a particular list of people and have them killed.”
Bengio said that even if an international convention were not signed by key players — the United States, China and Russia declined to sign the Ottawa Treaty banning mines — the awareness it stirs up can deter proliferation.
“The American companies gradually stopped producing land mines because of the moral stigma that became attached to doing this. So those treaties play not just a legal role, but also set social norms in ways that end up influencing behaviour,” he said.
Last year, Google opted not to renew a contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven — the U.S. military’s “pathfinder” AI program — after more than 3,000 employees signed a protest letter.
The technology at work in Project Maven, which uses machine learning to scan drone video for targets, has already been deployed in the Middle East and Africa, with the eventual aim of loading the software onto drones to locate people and objects on the fly.
The Canadian Armed Forces are now exploring how to use AI, with the air force conducting experiments, according to army Maj. Geoffrey Priems.
“My personal view is we need to look at this and approach it very methodically and get it right, as opposed to rushing and screwing it up,” said Priems, who is tasked with sketching out a concept by June 2020 for AI deployment.
“Nobody wants to cause a death through some friggin’ computer, unless we chose for that to happen, intentionally.”
Retaining human agency — and accountability — in decisions of life and death is one issue. Another is digital defects or built-in biases, said Graham Taylor, who heads a new AI ethics centre at the University of Guelph.
“Military organizations may be trying to frame these systems such that they reduce the civilian casualties,” he said. “On the other hand, there is always the capability of these systems making mistakes where a human is not directly in charge…and it becomes difficult to place responsibility on a particular individual.”
Privacy concerns also factor into the reams of data spawned by surveillance images.
“It’s an area that’s under development right now, but there’s no widespread regulation regarding the use of specifically AI technologies in the military,” he said.
The Department of National Defence says international law should form the basis for emerging weapons protocols, and that “more discussion around this complex and multi-faceted issue is needed at the international level and within Canada.”
An expert group established by the United Nations’ Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons held its inaugural meeting in November 2017, but progress toward a treaty has been slow, Bengio says.
“The way the UN works is not very functional. It’s enough that a few countries oppose to slow things considerably,” he said.
Bengio was among 400 participants at a November 2017 forum that produced the Montreal Declaration on the Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence. It lays out a principle that “the decision to kill must always be made by human beings, and responsibility for this decision must not be transferred to an AI.”

All participants will strive to create a new era of health jointly.
SHENZHEN, CHINA / ACCESSWIRE / September 29, 2019 / On September 21, the GBAS 2019 6th World Nobel Laureate Biomedical Summit was successfully held at Shenzhen.
The Summit is hosted by China Association of Chinese Medicine, China International Science and Technology Exchange Center, China High-tech Industrialization Association, China Pharmaceutical Industry Association, China Association for Science and Technology, International Society of Scientific Communications for Nobel Prize Laureates (ISSCNL), and Shenzhen Industry-University-Research Institute Collaboration Association.
Nearly 1,000 people attended the summit. Nobel Prize laureates, renowned academicians at home and abroad and masters of Chinese medicine, as well as many renowned entrepreneurs and members of international think tanks, gathered together to exchange ideas, deeply analyze future wisdom medical management and practice, seek new opportunities for integration and innovation, and explore the new pattern of life and health in the Dawan District, creating a better medical ecological system.
Main Forum: Experts Decoded the New Patterns of Life and Health
Wang Guoqiang, chairman of GBAS 2019 World Nobel Laureate Biomedical Summit, former deputy director of the National Health and Family Planning Commission of PRC, former director of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and president of the China Association of Chinese Medicine; Aaron Ciechanover, winner of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and other leaders gave an opening speech to the Summit, expressing their hope that more people will understand Shenzhen, a young city, to promote innovative and leapfrog development of life and health industry with an international and national perspective, achieve cross-border integration, and cooperate with Hong Kong and Macao to build a systematic, diversified and international exchange platform for the inheritance, further providing people all over the world with all-round and full-cycle health services.
Erwin Neher, the winner of 1991 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, gave a brilliant keynote speech titled "Ion Channels as Targets for Drugs, Poisons and Spices" Based on his years of research experience, he explained profound ion channels with simple terms and claimed that it was a very important target, playing a significant role in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
Tang Nong, the president of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, believed that as the quintessence of China, Chinese medicine has its development guaranteed by national law, which brings the new light and fresh hope. A platform that "everyone understands with sound clinical results, further inheritance, and characteristic development" should be built to explore a reasonable training mode while promoting the integration of medical university, research, medicine and industry.
How can all-optical methods affect brain, this most important organ of the human body? Michael Hausser, academician of the Academia Europaea, said that different functions could be detected by light of different wavelengths, and then the flashes were positioned to locate the neurons. Two ways were discovered by him: first, in terms of recording, optical inheritance can relieve the pressure of scientific research to some extent; and secondly, in the revolution of optical inheritance, a method was extracted from algae that could control the activity of neurons with blu-ray.
With the theme of "Frontier and Practice of Global Innovative Drug Discovery", Zhang Ziran, vice president of China Pharmaceutical Industry Association, hosted the talk. Aaron Ciechanover, winner of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Thomas Südhof, winner of 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Erwin Neher, winner of 1991 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Hong Hao, chairman and CEO of Asymchem, and Chen Mingjian, founder of founder of Holyhigh carried out high-level talks, exploring infinite possibilities of drug research and development from professional perspectives, and ways to overcome the difficulties of market access for innovative drugs.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi receives the Seoul Peace Prize. PTI Photo
The prestigious Seoul Peace Prize for 2018 was conferred on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday for his contribution to international cooperation and fostering global economic growth. With this, Modi also becomes the first Indian to be honoured with the award that was established in 1990 to commemorate the success of the 24th Olympic Games held in Seoul.
Before the award was presented to PM Modi by the Seoul Peace Prize Foundation at a grand ceremony in Seoul, a short film on his life and achievements was also screened, inviting huge applause from the audience. While conferring the award on PM Modi, the Peace Prize committee also credited him for his contribution toward regional and global peace through a proactive policy with countries around the world.
Speaking on the occasion, PM Modi said that the success that India has achieved in the last five years is due to aspirations, inspiration and efforts of the people of country.
“On their behalf, I accept the award and express my gratitude,” the PM said, adding that he was honoured that the award is being conferred on him in the year that India celebrates the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The Seoul Peace Prize was established in 1990 and since then the committee has maintained its biannual record of conferring the award. The award was established to crystalise Korean people’s yearning for peace on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of the world.
Narendra Modi is the 14th recipient of the award. Besides a diploma and a plaque, he also received an honorarium cash prize of $200,000 (Rs 1.4 crore). He donated the money to the Namami Gange Programme (National Mission for Clean Ganga).
Interestingly, many of the past Seoul Peace Prize recipients have also been nominated and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. With this, talks about PM Modi getting Nobel Peace Prize have started doing the rounds.
The past laureates who have been honoured with the Seoul Peace Prize and later won the Nobel Peace Prize include:
1. Médecins Sans Frontières (an international humanitarian medical NGO) – Seoul Peace Prize: 1996 and Nobel Peace Prize: 1999
2. Kofi Annan (diplomat from Ghana who served as 7th Secretary-General of the United Nations between 1997 and 2006) – Seoul Peace Prize: 1998 and Nobel Peace Prize: 2001
3. Muhammad Yunus (Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, economist, and civil society leader) – Seoul Peace Prize: 2006 and Nobel Peace Prize: 2006
4. Denis Mukwege (Congolese gynecologist and Pentecostal pastor) – Seoul Peace Prize: 2016 and Nobel Peace Prize: 2018
Interestingly, BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit president Tamilisai Soundararjan had in September last year nominated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Nobel Peace Prize. Soundararjan had nominated PM Modi for launching the world’s largest health scheme — Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana(PMJAY) also called Ayushman Bharat.
The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the most prestigious award of its kind in the world. The Nobel Prize was established by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman and philanthropist, in 1895. Since 1901, it has been awarded annually. The award is recognition of those who have done the best work for fraternity between nations to abolish or reduce tensions and promote peace.

You've probably heard a lot about the looming market recession over the past week. But at least one notable economist says public panic, rather than an inverted yield curve, may be the real indicator of the next market downturn.
Market watchers have been trumpeting the likelihood of a recession after the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly dipped below that of the 2-year U.S. note — which has happened for four days over a two-week period. Some experts consider this to be a fairly good indicator of recessions, but Robert Shiller, the Nobel-prize winning economist and Yale professor, says he's not convinced it will hold true this time around.
"It is a well-known leading indicator," acknowledges Shiller. "But I'm not as confident in it as others are," he tells CNBC Make It. Instead, he chalks it up to analysts "data-mining" to find any indicator that holds up. While the yield curve has preceded each of the seven recessions since the 1950s, with only one false positive, it's a fairly small data set to be really conclusive.
On Aug. 21, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below that of the 2-year rate again.
It's also worth noting that generally an inverted yield curve is considered a strong indicator of an upcoming recession if it has some staying power. So far, both of the recent inversions of the 2-year to 10-year spread have been brief.
That said, Shiller isn't completely ruling out the possibility of a market downturn, especially when you factor in the public's reaction to these recent yield curve inversions. "There's a huge discussion of inverted yield curves. We saw that before in 1980, and there was a big recession then," he says.
A lot of what happens with the markets is a "self-fulfilling prophecy," Shiller adds. "I hear so much talk about a market correction, it might make it happen."
But that doesn't mean investors should panic thinking a recession will hit tomorrow. On average, there's been a 17-month lag between the inversion and the last five recessions, according to research from Ben Carlson of Ritholtz Wealth Management.

The department facilitates interdisciplinary work on topics around inequality.
With an aim to honour renowned India-born economist Amartya Sen, the London School of Economics and Political Science, has announced a Chair in Inequality Studies in his name. The Nobel laureate served as a professor in the economics department at the institute from 1971-82.
The person holding the position would also serve in the capacity as the Director of the International Inequalities Institute at LSE, the institute said on its website. The department facilitates interdisciplinary work on topics around inequality.

The institute aims to acknowledge one of the world’s greatest thinkers on social equity by naming the chair after Amartya Sen, LSE Director Minouche Shafik said.
LSE looks to appoint a person with outstanding credentials to hold the position as the department delivers benefits to the people all across the world.
It was in the year 1998, Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize in the field of Economics. He also won National Humanities Medal in the year 2012. Amartya Sen’s main areas of work include welfare economics, social choice theory, development economics, political philosophy and economic theory.
Mike Savage is currently leading the International Inequalities Institute (III). He will return to hold the Martin White Chair in Sociology at LSE.Amartya Sen had recently released Hindi translation of his book ‘An Uncertain Glory: The Contradictions of Modern India.’
Meanwhile, in the last few years, the globally renowned economist had raised his concerns on various issues including tolerance. Earlier this year, he had rejected the dissed Ayushman Bharat saying that the healthcare scheme neglects primary healthcare. Both the NDA and BJP governments had neglected the healthcare facilities in the country, he had said. The government of the day needs to pursue better reforms in the healthcare sector to build capable citizens for near future, he added.

Nobel laureate Robert Shiller suggests a self-fulfilling is prophecy unfolding on Wall Street that could ultimately derail the longest bull market in history.
According to the Yale University economics professor, growing worries about a recession could make it come sooner — even if there isn't a specific event to spark it.
"A lot of people have that on their mind, and they think it's got to turn soon. I'm kind of with that. You know, if people think that, they're going to make it happen," Shiller said Wednesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."
Shiller, who's known for his behavioral finance research, estimates there's about a 50 percent chance the economy will tip into a recession within 18 months.
He's not sure what how long it could last or the magnitude. However, he isn't ruling out a Trump-related event — even though the president has been an integral part of the economic narrative behind the bull run.
"People who are good storytellers — like Donald J. Trump is a brilliant storyteller — they tend to rise in our economy," Shiller said. "He models a general public support for business, cuts profits taxes — what more can you ask?"
But if Trump loses his base because of his legal woes, Shiller believes that could usher in trouble.
He also refers to the growing budget deficit as an ominous economic issue. It grew to $913 billion for the fiscal year ending in January. That's 77 percent higher than the previous year.
And it's expected to get worse. The Congressional Budget Office projects yearly budget shortfalls will surpass $1 trillion beginning in 2022.
"That attention to public debt has waxed and waned throughout history," Shiller said. "It seems like the public is OK with it for now. But I think in the back of their minds they're not so sure."

A pyramid scheme is a con. It’s unsustainable. It ultimately will come to no good for everybody. Just ask Bernie Madoff, the notorious financial adviser who defrauded investors of billions and is now sitting in prison.
Or ask the eminently respectable Steven Chu.
Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and former U.S. secretary of Energy, said the world economy is a pyramid scheme, Forbes magazine contributor Jeff McMahon reported Friday morning.
“Increased economic prosperity and all economic models supported by governments and global competitors are based on having more young people, workers, than older people,” Chu said during a University of Chicago lecture. “Two schemes come to mind. One is the pyramid scheme. The other is the Ponzi scheme. I’m not going to explain them both to you, you can look it up.”
A pyramid scheme and a Ponzi scheme, the latter named after 1920s swindler Charles Ponzi, are quite similar. They’re both a kind of securities fraud that involves paying investors not with profits from growth but with the contributions of new investors. The difference, for the most part, is whether or not the participating investors are aware it’s all a scam.
“Depending on a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme, there’s no such thing as sustainability,” Chu said of how the world economy works. “The economists know this, but they don’t really talk about it in the open, and there’s no real discussion in government. Every government says you have to have an increase in population, whether you do it through immigrants or the home population. So, this is a problem."
Chu’s views on the subject aren’t exactly novel, though his comparing the world economy to well-known scams puts the issue in unusually stark relief. We all know, for example, that Social Security and Medicare face long-term financial challenges because current workers pay, to a growing extent, for the benefits of retired workers.
"The world needs a new model of how to generate a rising standard of living that’s not dependent on a pyramid scheme," Chu said.
And what might that model be?
He says it involves, for starters, green technologies and better education opportunities worldwide for women. But that’s a whole different lecture.

The United Bank for Africa Liberia (UBA) and Nobel Financial yesterday, October 30, signed a partnership agreement to foster sound financial transaction following the approval by the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) to do so.
According to the partnership agreement, Liberians in the United States will now have the opportunity to remit money by using the Nobel Financial Money Transfer platform via the UBA for their friends and family members.
During the discussion between executives of both institutions, Jallah Kesselly, President/CEO of Nobel Liberia, and the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of United Bank for Africa Liberia (UBA), Lekan Balogun, pledged their commitment to the existence of the partnership, which brings to four including Ecobank, the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI) and International Bank (IB) Liberia Ltd. and their respective branches around the country, as well other banking institutions to follow with Nobel Liberia offices on 11th Street, Tubman Boulevard in Sinkor.
Speaking further during the ceremony, the CEO of UBA praised the Nobel Liberia management for being farsighted in partnering with the bank, adding, “We hope this partnership will gain a fruitful outcome for our respective institutions.”
For his part, the President of Nobel Liberia, Jallah Kesselly, said with the UBA partnership, Liberians in the United States will have the opportunity to remit money to their relatives and friends at a very reasonable rate.
The Nobel Financial Money Transfer platform fee, according to Nobel Liberia management, is the cheapest rate as compared to other money transfer companies in the country.

‘I think personally that the yield curve is overrated as an indicator. I think its success in predicting has diminished somewhat.’ Robert Shiller
A lot of ink’s been spilled over the past week on the inversion of the yield curve, weighing its seemingly rock-solid reputation as a predictor of recessions and what that means for the stock market and other assets. But not everyone is impressed.
Read: The yield curve inverted — here are 5 things investors need to know
One of those skeptics is Robert Shiller, the Nobel-prize winning economist and Yale professor. In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday, he argued that much of the curve’s reputation is “to some extent…a product of what you call data mining.” In this case, while it’s true that an inversion of the curve, particularly when the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.27% falls below the 3-month T-bill yield TMUBMUSD03M, -2.06%, has preceded every recession since the late 1950s, it’s important to ask, “how many recessions have you had?”
In other words, the fact that an inverted curve has preceded the past seven recessions with only one outright false positive sounds impressive, but is perhaps too small a sample to get that excited about.
The 10-year-to-3-month measure of the curve inverted on March 22. That measure has been identified by researchers at the San Francisco Federal Reserve as the most reliable curve-related recession indicator. Stocks sold off sharply last Friday as the curve inverted, but have since rebounded, with the S&P 500 SPX, +0.33% on track for a 0.8% weekly rise and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.43% up 1.1%.
Meanwhile, analysts have debated the implications of the inversion for the stock market, with bulls noting that recessions have tended to follow the inversion by more than a year, a period that, on average, has seen robust stock-market returns. Bears contend the inversion is a signal the stock market has already peaked and will likely see pressure in months ahead as further signs of a slowdown begin to come into view.

Shiller, meanwhile, said it was extraordinary that the 10-year/3-month measure of the curve had gained little attention when it had been hovering above an inversion only to become the subject of a media frenzy once it turned negative.
“That’s an overreaction to one indicator,” he said.

In the present case, the recent surge in profits has been due to last year's tax cuts, backed by President Donald Trump, that took the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.
At a time when earnings are rising 25 percent a quarter, Shilller said that's not indicative of what longer-term results in the market will be. History has shown that in previous times, particularly around World War I, the late 1920s approaching the time of the Depression, and in the high-inflation 1980s, profits could be strong but equity results not as much.
Nobel laureate Robert Shiller thinks investors ought to ignore the recent burst in corporate profits and focus on longer-term valuation, which he says carries foreboding news for the stock market.
"My own way of thinking is it looks like an overreaction," Shiller said Friday at a conference in New York presented by the Wharton School. "We're launching a trade war. Aren't people thinking about that? Is that a good thing? I don't know, but I'm thinking it's likely to be bad times in the stock market."
The Yale economist is known for a number of groundbreaking views and theories on the market, but perhaps most for a gauge he uses to measure stock market valuations. The Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings ratio — often referred to as the "Shiller CAPE" or "Shiller PE" — looks at valuations over a 10-year period to smooth for fluctuations in the business cycle.
Currently, the gauge is at 33.3, its highest level since June 2001. The index peaked near 45 in mid-2000, just as the dot-com bubble was about to burst. Testing the model over time, it saw the market crashes in 1929 and 1987 as well as the dot-com bubble.
Shiller cautioned that he is not predicting major calamity for the market but rather a much lower level of returns, in the 2.6 percent annual range, than investors have come to expect during the 9-year-old bull market. The longest rally in history has the up more than 335 percent since the March 2009 bottom.
"It's not like I'm predicting a crash," he said. "This is a 10-year forward return. This is not going to be great, because we're just too high at the present value."
Among other things, he said the current tax climate won't last and corporate earnings will come back down, just as they have done in the past.
"Is Donald Trump permanent?" he asked to laughter. "I won't get into that, a lot of discord about that."
To be sure, the Shiller CAPE has been elevated for years and crossed 30 nearly a year ago. And not everyone agrees with his analysis — including his friend and sparring partner of 51 years and fellow speaker at the Friday event, Jeremy Siegel.
Siegel is the Russell E. Palmer professor of finance at the Wharton School and has long served as the bull to Shiller's bear. He contested several of Shiller's points, particularly about whether the market necessarily needs to revert to trend and what he sees as an oversight on the impact of low-cost passive investing on the market. On the latter point, thanks to low-fee ETFs it now costs investors less to have a balanced portfolio so they don't require returns as high to beat the market.
Even if stocks are expensive, Siegel said, they remain a bargain compared with bonds when considering the risk premium, or the amount of return investors demand compared to risk.
"Stocks are overvalued on a longer-term basis, but bonds are enormously overvalued on a long-term basis," he said. "Relative valuation of stocks vs. bonds is among the more favorable — not the most favorable but among the more favorable — in history."

When William Nordhaus won the Nobel prize in economics earlier this month, it ratified climate change into mainstream economics. His pioneering work integrating climate change into models of economic growth has provided a roadmap for a future where the world’s economic health is directly linked to its environmental one.
Bill was my teacher and colleague. His intellect and writing were so sharp that having him participate in our environmental economics seminars was like having Elvis show up to choir practice.
In awarding Nordhaus this prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences did more than recognize a great economist: The committee acknowledged that we can no longer discuss our economic future without considering the enormous costs of climate change.
Our changing environment is a drag on the global economy. If you have any doubt about that, just ask the residents of the Florida Panhandle. Following last week’s Hurricane Michael, they face an estimated $4.5 billion in losses from destroyed homes and businesses. The Category 4 hurricane was supercharged by warmer ocean water. In the near term, hurricanes can hurt retail and services, manufacturing, tourism, jobs, and real estate prices, and economic analysis has found that major hurricanes can even lower long-run growth in the US and affect its economy for up to two decades.
SevereStudios.com via AP The aftermath of Hurricane Michael.
While climate change has been caught up in our polarized politics, this Nobel is not a political statement: It is a reflection of a new reality of a warming world. Simply put, the committee recognized that if we are to understand and analyze economic growth, we can no longer ignore the trillions in costs, major agricultural disruptions, and threat to the billions of people who live along the world’s coastlines that will all arise from climate change.
The announcement on Monday Oct. 8 came just hours after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a special report underscoring the urgency of acting on climate change. It shows that limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C could save 10 million people from risk of sea-level rise and reduce the world population exposed to water stress by 50%. (The world has already warmed 1°C since pre-industrial times.) The report makes clear just how much we have to gain from limiting the rise in global temperatures—and how little time we have to act.
The IPCC has rung the alarm bell. Nordhaus’s work helps us see how to respond.
When there are no economic downsides to polluting, we all end up paying a higher cost in the form of a warming planet.
In order to correct the fundamental market failure at the heart of climate change, Nordhaus was an early advocate of policies that require climate polluters to pay the cost that they impose on all of us. A carbon tax with an appropriate mechanism to ensure pollution reductions can achieve that; so can an emission trading system like the ones underway in Europe and California.
When there are no economic downsides to polluting, we all end up paying a higher cost in the form of a warming planet. But when there’s money to be had from cutting carbon, capital will flow into developing and deploying the technologies that will do it cheaper and faster.
For much of his career, Nordhaus was a voice in the wilderness calling for economists to understand the full importance of climate change and integrate it into their models. Now any smart CEO knows that she must include climate impacts as part of her future planning. (Just ask those in the insurance industry, perhaps the financial players most sensitive to future catastrophes.)
Like any truly influential intellect, Nordhaus succeeded as much in what he got wrong as what he got right. His pathbreaking but admittedly simple model of the global economy spawned a lineage of more and more sophisticated models, all in productive tension and argument with Nordhaus’s original. He was criticized for putting too little weight on future benefits relative to current costs—an economics concept known as the “discount rate”—but that very criticism catalyzed advances in our understanding of how that rate should be chosen. His measured insistence on balancing marginal costs and benefits frustrated some environmentalists but inspired other economists to focus on the crucial role of risk and uncertainty.
It wasn’t a fluke that Nordhaus was paired with Paul Romer, this year’s other laureate. Romer was cited for his groundbreaking work on understanding innovation and technological change: a dynamic that will be vital to addressing climate change. Indeed, in the press conference to announce the prize, Romer himself said “Once we start to try to reduce carbon emissions, we’ll be surprised that it wasn’t as hard as anticipated.” This is as pithy a summary of the theory of endogenous technological change applied to climate as one could hope for.
Both Romer and Nordhaus have taught us that innovation won’t just happen on its own, and certainly not at the scale and pace needed to meet the challenge that the IPCC report underscores. The enduring legacy of both Nordhaus and Romer will be in how they advanced our understanding of policy solutions.
The IPCC special report is a stark reminder that we face a daunting future if we fail this test. But the work of the newly minted Nobel laureates should give us hope that we can meet it—by showing us the enormous opportunity we have to foster a more prosperous low-carbon economy, and reclaim the future for our children.
Bill Nordhaus has been making that case for a quarter century. It’s about time the rest of the world caught up.

On the other hand, AB Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi, all extended the hand of friendship, only to be spat at.
Asking for a Nobel Peace prize for Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan would have required a rather rare form of lack of shame on the part of the Pakistani information minister Fawad Chaudhry. You could be kind and think, perhaps, the minister bought the Pakistani propaganda about peace overtures in the latest conflict with India hook, line and sinker. But it is more likely that, given the stakes involved, he had to go the whole hog in trying to project Imran Khan’s stance—and indeed, Pakistan’s—as one of peace-preserving, and thus, there was no room for even a soupcon of shame. Even if that meant being revoltingly blasé and outlandish and beg for a Nobel for Khan, so be it. Khan, thankfully, showed trace amounts of grace, saying that he is not worthy of the prize, but the prize should go to someone who works for a peaceful solution to the Kashmir problem, keeping in mind the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
If that be the bar, the Pakistani side might as well give up any Nobel dreams. Whether or not you believe it was the Indian government’s aggressive military and diplomatic tactics that forced Pakistan to plead for peace, it is impossible to deny that Pakistan’s military and civilian leadership has, for decades, undermined any scope of a peaceful solution to the Kashmir question. Its support to terrorist groups—the Pulwama attack has exposed its forked tongue on terrorism to the world—its role in fomenting trouble in the Valley through hawkish and ‘moderate’ separatists, etc, suggest no individual or regime from Pakistan has ever been interested in a peaceful solution. On the other hand, AB Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi, all extended the hand of friendship, only to be spat at. Pakistan’s lies have caught up with it time and again—from the Mumbai terror attack investigation to the US military raid that killed Osama binLaden, there are enough instances of Pakistan’s duplicity getting exposed. Peace Nobel is a rich demand, Pakistan must first assure the world that it no longer dishes out sheer bull on supporting terror.

The standoff between Washington and Beijing will drag on for some time despite recent messages from President Donald Trump stating that progress had been made in the trade talks, economist Michael Spence told CNBC Monday.
Trump tweeted last week that he had "a long and very good" conversation with the Chinese president, which included discussions on trade. He also said that negotiations were "moving along nicely," which drove global equities higher.
But according to Spence, a Canadian-American economist who won the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with George Akerlof and Joseph E. Stiglitz, this back and forth will continue for some time.
"The fundamental reason is that if you go back 10 or 15 years, everybody thought that some kind of conversion was going to occur in terms of governance and economic systems and it would be easier to work these things out," he said.
"(But) it's pretty clear that's not going to happen, so what we have is a much more complicated challenge, working out mutually-beneficial arrangements between very different systems," he added.

Kailash Satyarthi, the winner of a Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against child labor and exploitation, said his mission as a children’s rights activist began when he himself was a child.
On his first day of school, Satyarthi saw another kid about his age working as a shoeshine boy instead of attending class. It disturbed him so much that one day he gathered the courage to ask the boy’s father, a cobbler, why he didn’t send him to school. The answer left an indelible mark on Satyarthi.
“He told me, ‘You’re born to go to school, and we’re born to work,’” he recalled during a phone call from New York.
“It was a shock for me,” said Satyarthi, who was born into a high-caste Indian family. “I started crying because I didn’t know anything about the caste system and the hierarchies and discrimination associated with it. But I started looking at the world with different eyes, and I began questioning it because it wasn’t right.”
Satyarthi put his feelings into action. At just 11, he collected used books and created a book bank for poor children. The first rescue operation he undertook, with friends and colleagues, was to free a 14-year girl who had been abducted and was about to be sold to a brothel. As an adult he considered creating a charity or an orphanage, but instead founded an organization to defend children’s rights, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save Childhood Movement), which campaigns to end bonded labor, child labor, and human trafficking, and advocates for education for all children.
In 2014 he was awarded the Nobel along with Malala Yousafzai, the then-teenage Pakistani activist who survived being shot in the head by Taliban assassins, “for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.”
On Friday, Satyarthi, now 65, will be on campus for a screening of “The Price of Free,” a documentary about his life and mission that won the 2018 U.S. Documentary Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. An excerpt will be shown at 4 p.m. at Sanders Theatre at an event hosted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Faculty of Arts & Sciences. Chan School Dean Michelle Williams, the Angelopoulos Professor in Public Health and International Development, will give introductory remarks. The screening will be followed by a discussion with Satyarthi.
An admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, Satyarthi gave up his career as an electrical engineer and his high-caste name, Sharma, in the 1980s, swapping it for Satyarthi, which means “seeker of truth.” He also started working full time for his cause.
Through his organization, Satyarthi has freed more than 80,000 children from forced labor in dangerous rescue operations. Two members of his group have been killed, one shot and the other beaten to death by criminal gangs connected to companies that use enslaved children as labor. Satyarthi himself has also suffered attacks.
“They want to eliminate me and crush my organization because they feel threatened by our work,” he said. “But they are the ones in danger. They’re getting weaker, and our movement is getting stronger.”
Due to the Save Childhood Movement’s advocacy, in 1986 the Indian government passed the Child Labour Act, which prohibits hiring children younger than 14 years old for hazardous jobs. In 1998, Satyarthi led a global march against child labor across 103 countries, and a year later the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted Convention No. 182, concerning the prohibition of and immediate action on eliminating the worst forms of child labor.
The work is far from over, said Satyarthi. According to the ILO, 152 million children remain in forced labor around the world.
“We’d like to see universities become strong champions for the cause,” said Satyarthi. “My mission in life is that every child on the earth is free; free to walk to school, free to laugh, free to play. When every child is free to be a child, only then my dream will come true.”
Admission is free but tickets are required. Tickets can be picked up at the Harvard Box Office.

Recession risk is real, according to Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, and one might come as soon as this year.
Whether the U.S. will experience a contraction has become one of the hottest debated topics among investors amid uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade talks, deteriorating earnings forecasts and slowing growth around the globe. The ambiguity caused the almost-decade-long rally in U.S. stocks to come within a whisker of its end in December.
“It seems like there has to be an elevated probability of a recession this year or next year,” the Yale University economics professor said during a panel discussion at the InsideETFs conference in Hollywood, Fla. “There are these signs that show people are worried. It’s also the longest bull market in the stock market,” he said. “There’s a spirit of thinking –- it ought to come to an end soon.”
The chance of a recession happening over the next 12 months is 25 per cent, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday in Mississippi that “we don’t feel the probability of recession is at all elevated.”
The ongoing debate makes it all the more important to focus on how the markets are interrelated, said Jeffrey Sherman, DoubleLine Capital LP’s deputy chief investment officer. Rates are higher compared with recent history, we’ve seen margins compress a bit, and it’s possible GDP growth slows down to trend — closer to two per cent, he said. When it comes to investing, everyone needs some stocks in their portfolios, they just have to be “more cautious,” Sherman said during the panel discussion.
“You have peak earnings and peak euphoria,” Sherman said. “The question becomes, how does corporate America respond at this stage? It doesn’t look horrible.”
Shiller and DoubleLine have a long relationship. The DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE fund puts the majority of its investments into a fixed-income portfolio, while at the same time employing derivatives to gain exposure to large-cap equities that are undervalued based on an index created by Shiller. Launched in 2013, the fund’s five-year track record puts the product in the 99th percentile when compared with peers, according to a Bloomberg ranking.
The cyclically adjusted P-E ratio (CAPE), which Shiller developed 30 years ago, uses 10 years of earnings in its calculations to gauge stock market valuations. Right now the measure comes in around 30, which is “quite high” according to Shiller, especially considering that’s about double the historical average. Going forward, though, the ratio should come down just because of time — the worst earnings during the financial crisis should fall out of the equation soon.
“That doesn’t mean you expect negative returns,” Shiller said.

NDTV journalist Ravish Kumar has won the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award 2019. Popularly known as 'Asia's Nobel Prize', it is among the highest honours in the region.

These are the five recipients of Asia’s premier prize and highest honor, the 2019 Ramon Magsaysay Awardees. #RamonMagsaysayAward pic.twitter.com/HrLG1qVt6L
— Ramon Magsaysay Award (@MagsaysayAward) August 2, 2019
The award committee tweeted a list of recipients for 2019, saying that Kumar has been honoured for his “courage undaunted” while “harnessing journalism to give voice to the voiceless”.
Ravish Kumar has won the honour for his news show, Prime Time, which "deals with real-life, under-reported problems of ordinary people".
Kumar, 44, who is NDTV India's senior executive editor is one of India's most influential TV journalists, the award citation said.
The four other winners of the 2019 Ramon Magsaysay Award are Ko Swe Win from Myanmar, Angkhana Neelapaijit from Thailand, Raymundo Pujante Cayabyab from Philippines and Kim Jong-Ki from South Korea.
Established in 1957, the Ramon Magsaysay Award is named after former Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay who represented courage, integrity and idealism.
The award is given every year to individuals or organisations in Asia who manifest the same selfless service and transformative influence that ruled the life of the late and beloved Filipino leader.
Other Indian winners from the journalistic background who received the award in the past include Amitabha Chowdhury (1961), Boobli George Verghese (1975), Gour Kishore Ghosh (1981), Arun Shourie (1982) and Palagummi Sainath (2007).
Icons like Satyajit Ray (1967), MS Subbulakshmi (1974) and RK Laxman (1984) were also honoured with the award.

Robert Shiller, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, told CNBC on Thursday that he's concerned about the upheaval in the stock market and signs of a slowdown in the economy.
"I am worried about these markets and about a recession," warned the Yale University professor on "Squawk on the Street." "The turmoil in the market, it's more the theory that we're hearing that some correction is overdue, than any specific action of the Fed." He pointed out, "We've had a very highly priced stock market and housing market and bond market."
The Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday to increase interest rates for the fourth time in 2018 and project two hikes next year was "reasonable on the basics," given the persistence of the economic recovery since the 2008 financial crisis.
Shiller, co-creator of the S&P Case/Shiller home prices index, does recognize that pockets of the economy, especially housing, have been coming under pressure. "There a lot of indicators showing softening" in housing, he said. "It is worrisome."
But the small rate hike from the Fed should not really impact real estate that much and should not be upsetting the financial markets to this extent, he contended.
Wall Street does not agree. The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened nearly 100 points lower Thursday and accelerated to the downside by midday. The Dow sank 351 points Wednesday, closing at a 13-month low and sliding further into correction territory, after the Fed's move on rates. The correction in the was getting worse on Thursday, while the Nasdaq touched a bear market.
(A correction is defined as a decline in an asset or index of 10 percent or more from recent highs. Meanwhile, a bear market is measured by a drop of 20 percent or more from recent highs.)
Meanwhile, Shiller praised Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as "levelheaded," saying he's impressed with what the central bank chief is doing to normalize rates. The Yale economist said the Fed is being "very reasonable" and it's "not out of bounds at all."
Powell has not been very popular on Wall Street or in Washington, with many traders and investors wondering why rates need to still go up and President Donald Trump openly and repeatedly castigating Powell before Wednesday's rate increase.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The financial crimes unit of the Swedish police said on Friday it had started an investigation into the Swedish Academy, the institution that picks the winners of the Nobel Literature prize.
FILE PHOTO: A general view of the Swedish Academy's annual meeting at the Old Stock Exchange building in Stockholm, Sweden December 20, 2017. TT News Agency/Jonas Ekstromer via REUTERS/File Photo
The prestigious Academy has become embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct by the husband of one of its members and the admission that the names of some prize-winners - the subject of intense speculation and on which many people place bets with betting firms - were leaked in advance.
Photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of poet and Academy member Katarina Frostenson, has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct, made by several women. He has also denied being the source of the leaked names.
“Chief Prosecutor Jan Tibbling of the Swedish Economic Crime Authority has started a preliminary investigation related to financial crime ... connected with the Swedish Academy,” the financial crime unit said in a statement.
Tibbling said he would not give further information on which crimes were being investigated nor the persons or people who were involved.
The Swedish Academy could not immediately be reached by telephone or email for comment. Arnault’s lawyer could also not immediately be reached for comment.
The workings of the normally secretive institution have come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks as a result of the allegations and a bitter and very public split among its members about how to handle them.
The head of the Academy and several of its members have stepped down. Sweden’s King Carl Gustaf - the patron of the institution founded by his forbear Gustav III in 1786 - has had to step in and promise to reform its arcane statutes.
Until now, Academy members have been appointed for life and resignations have been extremely rare. Even when members step down, they have not been able to formally leave.
The Nobel Foundation Board, which administers the money left by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel to fund the awards that bear his name, has criticised the Swedish Academy for potentially tarnishing the reputation of the Nobel Prize.

President Donald Trump listens to Nobel Peace Prize winner Nadia Murad, a Yazidi from Iraq, center, as he meets with survivors of religious persecution in the Oval Office of the White House on July 17, 2019, in Washington. (Image: AP)
US President Donald Trump on July 17 appeared unfamiliar with the work and cause of Nobel laureate Nadia Murad as she pleaded with him to help the Yazidis of Iraq.
Murad, one of the thousands of women and girls from the ancient faith abducted by the Islamic State group as they overran swathes of Iraq in 2014, joined a group of survivors of religious persecution who met Trump in the Oval Office on the sidelines of a major meeting at the State Department.
After Murad explained how her mother and six brothers were killed and that 3,000 Yazidis remained missing, Trump said, "And you had the Nobel Prize? That's incredible. They gave it to you for what reason?"
With little pause, Murad, who was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, repeated her story.
"After all this happened to me, I didn't give up. I make it clear to everyone that ISIS raped thousands of Yazidi women," she said, referring to the Islamic State group. "Please do something. It's not about one family," she said.
Trump, who has boasted of crushing the self-styled caliphate of the Islamic State group that once stretched across Iraq and Syria, also appeared at a loss when Murad asked him to press the Iraqi and Kurdish governments to create safe conditions for the Yazidis to return.
"But ISIS is gone and now it's Kurdish and who?" Trump asked, before later telling her, "I know the area very well."
Murad also explained how Yazidis took dangerous routes to find safety in Germany, whose welcome to refugees has been vocally criticized by Trump.
The US leader also appeared unfamiliar when he met a representative from the Rohingya, a Muslim minority targeted in a brutal campaign two years ago in Myanmar.
One day earlier, his administration banned travel to the United States by Myanmar's army chief and three other senior officers, calling the violence "ethnic cleansing."
The Trump administration frequently speaks of promoting religious freedom, a key issue for much of his evangelical Christian base.

In an effort to bolster the federal Liberals shaky arguments for a semi-national, cash-circulating Rube Goldberg carbon-tax price mechanism, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government are pointing to the work of William Nordhaus, one of this year’s Nobel Prize-winning economists.
Canadians would be better off taking advice from a Nobel Prize winner who supports carbon taxation than listening to “ideologues and politicians who deny there’s a problem in the first place,” Trudeau told high school students in Ottawa on Monday.
Similar appeals to Nordhaus as bearer of a Nobel encyclical for the new tax have come from Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s personal secretary. Butts, a former World Wildlife Fund activist, earlier this month tweeted: “You can now choose between a Nobel Prize-winning economist and (conservative politicians) Kenney/Ford/Scheer when deciding who is right about the economics of pollution pricing.”
Rube Goldberg, by the way, is the famed cartoonist from the early 20th century who drew images of wildly improbable contraptions. In 1931, he produced a pretty good illustration of a “Professor Butts” demonstrating his self-operating dinner napkin, which appears to function in roughly the same way as the climate-fixing carbon price. (The napkin contraption can be found at Wikipedia’s Rube Goldberg entry.)
Canada’s half-baked, go-it-alone deployment of such a regime is doomed
Aside from the twisted problems embedded in the Trudeau-Butts carbon-price scheme, there’s another niggling issue. Any reading of Nordhaus’s work on carbon taxation cannot avoid the conclusion that Canada’s half-baked, go-it-alone deployment of such a regime is doomed.
As I mentioned in a recent column on Nordhaus, the Nobel economist reached a “bottom line” conclusion in a 2014 paper that a carbon tax would require “clubs” of participating nations that would impose “penalties and sanctions on non-participants” to enforce international climate agreements. Unless most or at least a large number of major countries adopted a similar carbon tax and imposed direct tariffs of up to 10 per cent on all imports from non-carbon-tax countries (so-called free riders) then the carbon tax idea will fail — just like the Kyoto protocol, which set out to reduce greenhouse gas emissions back in 1997.
In other words, based on Nordhaus’s own writing on the subject, the Nobel Laureate would have to assess Canada’s carbon tax plan as dysfunctional and ineffectual.
However, in response to my recent assessment, Andrew Leach, a University of Alberta economist and sometime adviser to Alberta’s NDP government, dropped me a tweet: “@andrew_leach Replying to @terencecorcoran my PhD thesis built on Nordhaus’s work. I’ve got a pretty good grasp of his body of work. But, by all means, keep trying to use quotes out of context from a guy who won a Nobel for climate change econ to advance your petty agenda. Just make sure to ignore what he said about BC.”

With this, Leach has woven a sarcastic web in which he gets a little tangled up in his own cleverness.
First, regarding the PhD thesis: Leach’s thesis was written in 2003, 10 years before Nordhaus published his critique of carbon-tax theory in a 2014 paper, Climate Clubs: Designing a Mechanism to Overcome Free-riding in International Climate Policy. Perhaps Leach missed this and other nuances in Nordhaus’s views, although that’s hard to imagine.
Second, Leach sarcastically tells me to make sure I ignore what Nordhaus said about British Columbia’s carbon tax. OK, let’s look at what he said about the B.C. tax in a New York Times interview. “When I talk to people about how to design a carbon price, I think the model is British Columbia. You raise electricity prices by $100 a year, but then the government gives back a dividend that lowers Internet prices by $100 year. In real terms, you’re raising the price of carbon goods but lowering the prices of non-carbon-intensive goods.”
Except 95 per cent of the electricity produced in B.C. is hydropower and is not CO2-taxed. B.C. does import more coal-fired power than any other province, but the CO2 tax is not applied to imported electricity. Therefore the carbon tax has had next-to-no impact on the province’s electricity prices — in spite of its significant imports of coal-fired power from Alberta.
And it gets worse. If a utility burns B.C. natural gas to produce electricity in the province, the CO2 tax appears in the consumer’s utility bill. But if B.C. natural gas is shipped across the border into Washington, made into electricity there, and then exported back to the province, there’s no CO2 tax in the utility bill. How bizarre is that?
So, note to Leach: Make sure you find out what Nordhaus actually knows about the B.C. tax. And, while you’re at it, have a look at whether B.C.’s carbon tax has been effective in curbing emissions and fossil fuel use.
Finally, the suggestion that Nordhaus’s conclusion on the “bottom line” on carbon taxes was taken “out of context” does not stand up. In his 2014 paper, Nordhaus uses “bottom line” four times, including this reference from the abstract summary of his conclusions:
It “has proven difficult to overcome the obstacles to reaching international agreements caused by free-riding, as seen with the defunct Kyoto Protocol… The bottom line of this study is the following: Using a simplified representation of climate change economics and international trade, it finds that without sanctions there is no stable climate coalition other than the non-cooperative minimal-abatement coalition. However, a regime with small trade penalties on nonparticipants can induce a stable coalition with globally efficient levels of abatement. Moreover, such a regime would attract a large majority of countries relative to the current situation, where international climate treaties are essentially voluntary. The essential feature for making the club effective is uniform penalty tariffs on nonparticipants.”
Nordhaus is equally explicit in his 2013 book, The Climate Casino. On pages 256-7 (look it up), he says an effective climate policy involves a carbon price set nationally and internationally and enforced through sanctions, penalties and tariffs — as high as 10 per cent, he has suggested — applied across the board on all imports from non-complying countries.
The message to Leach and Butts is that the Trudeau carbon tax contraption does not follow the Nordhaus international trade model. As a result, the plan will not and cannot work. Look it up.

Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman warns a global recession could come this year
The "Squawk Box" crew breaks down three stories that might give you an executive edge, including why Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman believes there might be a global recession in 2019.

Story 111
Nobel Laureate Richard Thaler is widely known for bringing a human touch to complex economic topics. The renowned behavioral economist’s insight that humans are predictably irrational and consistently make choices which are not in their best interest, while seemingly simple, is patently profound.
As an example, it has been widely reported that only half of workers in the U.S. participate in a workplace retirement plan. Many of them don’t have access, but many do, and simply don’t take advantage of them. Yet, it’s clear that saving for retirement is the rational and economically optimal outcome.
In a less obvious display, he found that individuals who received a discount on gasoline opted to use the savings to purchase premium gasoline, even if worse for their automobile, instead of banking the savings for more important purchases or financial priorities. His research also highlights the anecdote of a man who sees a $125 cashmere sweater but refuses to buy it due to its high price, yet is very happy when he receives it as a gift from his wife. They only have joint bank accounts. In another example, I found a story of a man who spent nearly $1,500 a year for a pest control he didn’t need because he saw a single roach in his new home.
Most people think they regularly make wise choices for themselves, but the data says otherwise.
Among his more important findings, Thaler, through years of studying human behavior and economic theory, found that people only save money if it’s automatic. This led him to identify the pillars of a solid 401(k) offering:
Automatic enrollment
Automatic escalation
Good default low-cost investment options
Helping individuals roll their 401(k) into an IRA when they change jobs
Like many of his findings, the formula seems basic, yet isn’t widely adopted. To top managers he says, “ If the employees at your firm are not saving enough for retirement, realize that it is your fault. And that is because we know how to make saving for retirement much easier and more successful.” And since so many U.S. workers aren’t saving enough, there’s a lot of managers at fault.
The reason you should care is because your financial well-being and that of your employees will surely affect the bottom line. A report released by Gallup on the Economics of Wellbeing shows that low financial well-being can lead to “stress, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, and depression”. Any of which can greatly reduce productivity, output and employee retention. Specifically, Gallup found that, “After controlling for demographics, including income, those who contributed a higher proportion of their income to the 401k plan had significantly higher overall well-being and, in particular, financial well-being.”
For HR managers and senior executives the message is clear. You need to make employer-sponsored retirement plan participation automatic. By making 401(k) participation an opt-out decision you will be creating a barrier to prevent individuals from harming themselves by forgoing automatic retirement savings.
Secondly, automatic contribution escalations allow employees to automatically increase their savings rate while making it a gradual process. I’ve previously highlighted that your monthly savings rate is the number one thing that will determine whether you’ll be able to retire or not. A few percentage points in either direction can and will move the needle.
Thirdly, make sure to provide employees with solid low-cost investment options. Low-cost target date funds and diversified index funds are the perennial favorites. Fidelity recently launched a total stock market index fund with zero fees, which highlights the fact that making responsible investment decisions on a budget is possible. An annual expense ratio of 0.2% or lower is now the standard for best-in-class. Thaler shows that humans are predictably irrational, so nudging sound investment decisions is critical.
Finally, we no longer live in the age of joining a company after college and remaining there for your entire career. We left those days long ago. Which means that companies need to beef up their game when it comes to helping departing employees roll over their 401(k) into an IRA, so that they can continue to make contributions for retirement. Thaler cities this transition as the largest leakage in the system, and it results in many people vastly under-saving for retirement. It doesn’t need to happen.
It’s clear that automation is the key to getting your employees to be financially prepared for the future, and as a senior manager, you manage those levers. The fate of your employees is in your hands, thankfully, the incentives are aligned so that everyone wins. You just need to make the rational decision.

There's a "real amnesia going on in the political sphere" that threatens the global economy ahead of the next financial crisis, according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman.
In an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Krugman laid out what he thought was being overlooked and explained how those factors could come back to bite us in the next crisis.
Paul Krugman does not know what exactly will cause the next financial crisis.
When the professor and Nobel Prize-winning economist surveys the global economy, nothing looks quite as compelling as the housing bubble that helped jump-start the Great Recession about a decade ago.
What does raise red flags, however, is an apparent forgetfulness of why the crisis struck in the first place. Krugman specifically pointed to the rise of shadow banking — or institutions that look like banks and function like them but are not regulated with the same scrutiny.
After the most recent financial crisis, other economists pinpointed the loosely regulated market for repurchase agreements (short-term loans offered to institutional investors) as one of the main triggers.
The topic arose again earlier this year when, before the 10th anniversary of the crisis, the Financial Stability Board — a regulatory watchdog for G20 countries — said its measure of shadow-banking activities rose 8% to $99 trillion. That made up about 30% of global financial assets and was the highest level since 2002.
"The case for basically revitalizing the system of bank regulation to cover this broader financial universe is really strong," Krugman told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.
"That's important because a lot of people are pushing really hard to take away the limited financial regulations that were in fact put in place ... It's this real amnesia going on in the political sphere."
This is one of the lessons Krugman hopes to impart — especially to people who aren't economists — in a recently launched online course on economics for Masterclass.
Another thing Krugman wants people to bear in mind is how certain swaths of the public reacted to the crisis. In his view, there were unfounded concerns that swirled around the stimulus measures that monetary authorities put in place to revive the economy, including the Federal Reserve's unprecedented bond purchases to suppress borrowing costs. This expansion will be the longest ever if it continues through July.

"I hope we'll have less harassment of the Fed and other players when they try to deal with the [next] crisis," Krugman said. "We had an amazing amount of trying to stop them from doing what they could, which was limited by all these years of totally unwarranted fears of inflation."
While the feared inflation did not materialize, there are other worries that now make the economy more vulnerable to the next crisis.
"We are poorly prepared to deal with the next shock," Krugman said. "Interest rates are still close to zero in the US and in most of the rest of the advanced world. The fiscal policy we did was badly handled in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, and there's no particular reason to think it will be better. In fact, there's good reason to think it will be worse."
That's not all. The trade war between the US and China persists, with investors eagerly awaiting the outcome of expected talks at the G20 meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Krugman, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on international trade, said the two countries were in danger of throwing away frameworks that successfully governed exchanges between countries for years.
"'If I sell to you, I win, and if I buy from you, I lose' is a really wrong way to look at things," he said.
Still, Krugman declined to pin the cause of the next crisis on trade disruptions, Fed policy, deregulation, or any other specific catalyst. He said that while most people — even those of his pedigree — were bad short-term forecasters, it shouldn't stop them from trying to understand and mitigate the inevitable next shock.
"The tragedy of all this is that we actually had the knowledge and we had the tools to make this a much less severe crisis than it actually turned out being," Krugman said.

CLOSE Earlier this year, America surpassed Russia and China as producers of oil and natural gas and supplied more clean energy than coal. Here's how. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY
WASHINGTON – Teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg has continued to make news leading into the announcement Friday of the winner for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, for which she is nominated.
The 16-year-old Swede recently inspired the largest climate strike in history, testified before Congress, and addressed the United Nations — again.
The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded annually to the person or organization that has "done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses."
Thunberg was nominated for inspiring millions to march for climate change and standing up to leadership around the globe.
Norwegian Socialist MP Freddy André Øvstegård said Thunberg "has launched a mass movement which I see as a major contribution to peace" and that they nominated her for the prize "because if we do nothing to halt climate change it will be the cause of wars, conflict, and refugees."
Thunberg recently scolded hundreds of world leaders at the UN saying through tears, "how dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”
If selected, the teen would be the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate since Malala Yousafzai.
Here are some of the things to know about the teen climate change activist:
She founded 'Fridays For Future'
Thunberg first came to global attention with #FridaysForFuture, an international movement that began in 2018 when Thunberg, then age 15, started taking weeks off school to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament to protest against inaction on climate change.
She posted her protests on social media, and her postings went viral, inspiring thousands all over the world to protest their respective governments.
She has encouraged other students to skip school to join protests demanding faster action on climate change.
"We are facing a disaster of unspoken suffering for enormous amounts of people," Thunberg said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. "Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that homo sapiens have ever faced."
She has addressed two United Nations' summits by the age of 16
Thunberg garnered international attention at the United Nations COP24 Climate Summit in Poland last year, when she told assembled world leaders that they “have ignored us in the past, and you will ignore us again,” she said. “You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.”
The climate talks that culminated at the summit resulted in nearly 200 nations agreeing to rules that will govern the Paris Climate Agreement.
This year, she spoke through to tears to hundreds of world leaders in New York, pleading that "People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of the mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?”
The speech once again went viral.
She recently led potentially the largest climate rally ever
Before the 2019 UN Summit, millions of people around the world took part in September's Global Climate Strike, and estimates of total crowd sizes reached between an estimated 4 million to 7.6 million people.
On Sept. 20, and during the weeks following, millions marched through cities around the globe.
Thunberg marched in New York City, where she addressed thousands of strikers, exclaiming to the crowd, "This is an emergency. Our house is on fire."
Last Friday over 4 million people striked for the climate.
This Friday we do it again!

She has given President Trump the glare
After Thunberg delivered her emotional speech to world leaders at the UN in September, news cameras captured her staring at President Donald Trump when he arrived in the same lobby she was in.
If a picture is worth 1,000 words then this GIF is worth 100,000 #ClimateWeek2019pic.twitter.com/AqXdeUzgk3 — NowThis (@nowthisnews) September 23, 2019
Trump tweeted after her speech that, "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future," the President wrote over Thunberg's quote. "'So nice to see!"
Thunberg responded by changing her Twitter bio to replicate his tweet.
Trump had been at odds with world leaders specifically on climate after he announced in 2017 that the U.S. would formally withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. He made an unexpected appearance at the UN climate summit in September, for a total of 14 minutes.
She's testified before Congress
Thunberg was one of the witnesses to testify in September before a joint hearing of two House committees on the “global climate crisis.”
During the hearing, she had a simple message for American lawmakers: Do something.
Instead of planning a lengthy opening statement to start the hearing, Thunberg simply offered a copy of the 2018 global warming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that emphasizes the dire threat that human-caused global warming poses, along with the climate and economic impacts.
"I am submitting this report as my testimony because I don’t want you to listen to me," Thunberg told lawmakers. "I want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take real action."
'I want you to take action': Greta Thunberg testifies before Congress
She's been recognized by Time Magazine
In Time Magazine, Thunberg was featured as a "next generation" leader and was on the magazine's 2019 "100 list" of the world’s most influential people.
In May of 2019, the teen activist was featured on the magazine's cover.
“The world is listening. Organizers estimate that on March 15, a remarkable 1.6 million people in 133 countries participated in a climate strike inspired by Thunberg’s solo action,” the magazine's passage about her reads.
She sailed across the Atlantic, rather than fly
In August, Thunberg again captured global attention when she set off from Plymouth, United Kingdom, on a two-week zero-emissions boat voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City.
Thunberg popularized the movement of flygskam, or flight shaming, which asks Swedes to travel according to their beliefs.
Thunberg wouldn't fly to the U.S. ahead of the United Nations meeting on climate because of emissions from air travel. So, she and a crew traveled on a zero-emissions racing yacht.
"It is insane that a 16-year-old would have to cross the Atlantic Ocean to make a stand," she said. "The climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis, the biggest crisis that humanity has ever faced, and if we don't manage to work together and to cooperate and to work together despite our differences, then we will fail."
She has been praised, and criticized, by world leaders and celebrities
As Thunberg's name earned global recognition, world leaders and celebrities offered their praise, and criticism.
Thunberg met with former President Barack Obama during her visit to Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to lobby lawmakers on environmental issues and protest outside the White House.
In a tweet, Obama called Thunberg one of the “planet's greatest advocates."
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. pic.twitter.com/VgCPAaDp3C — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 17, 2019
Calling the outspoken teen one of her favorite "gutsy women," Hillary Clinton, former secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, encouraged her Twitter followers to join in the Global Climate Strike in September.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Thunberg's most recent UN speech, calling her “a kind and very sincere girl” who doesn’t understand the complexities of “the modern world.”
Thunberg hit back similarly to Trump's criticism of her, once again simply changing her twitter bio.

She is on the autism spectrum — and she calls being 'different' a 'superpower'
In a post about haters who use her Asperger's diagnosis to try to diminish her activism, Thunberg called her autism a "superpower."
When haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you’re winning!
I have Aspergers and that means I’m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And - given the right circumstances- being different is a superpower.#aspiepowerpic.twitter.com/A71qVBhWUU — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 31, 2019
"When haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you’re winning!" Thunberg wrote. "I have Asperger’s syndrome and that means I’m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And — given the right circumstances — being different is a superpower."
She told the New Yorker: “I see the world a bit different, from another perspective. I have a special interest. It’s very common that people on the autism spectrum have a special interest.”

Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg was named on Wednesday as one of four winners of the 2019 Right Livelihood Award, known as Sweden’s alternative Nobel Prize.
Thunberg won the award “for inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts,” the Right Livelihood Foundation said in a statement.
Thunberg, 16, denounced world leaders on Monday for failing to tackle climate change in a speech at the start of a climate summit at the United Nations in New York.
She started solitary weekly protests outside Swedish parliament a year ago. Inspired by her, millions of young people poured onto streets around the world last Friday to demand governments attending the summit take emergency action.
Thunberg shares the award with Brazilian indigenous leader Davi Kopenawa of the Yanomami people, Chinese women’s rights lawyer Guo Jianmei and Western Sahara human rights defender Aminatou Haidar.
“With the 2019 Right Livelihood Award, we honour four practical visionaries whose leadership has empowered millions of people to defend their inalienable rights and to strive for a liveable future for all on planet Earth,” the foundation said in the statement.
The four laureates will receive a cash award of 1 million Swedish crowns ($103,000) each.

By CCN.com: President Donald Trump is scaling back military exercises in Korea, calmly and humorously building a rapport with the world’s youngest nuclear power, and making a remarkably hasty exit from Syria. He seems far more deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama.
Nobel Prize Committee Regrets 2009 Obama Award
In 2015 Nobel Prize secretary Geir Lundestad said that Obama’s Nobel Peace Prize “didn’t achieve what it [the Nobel Prize Committee] had hoped for.”
No Nobel Peace Prize award had ever drawn so much publicity. Or scrutiny.
Even many of Obama’s supporters thought the award was premature: It was given to Obama a few mere months into his term – and before he had really done anything.
It was a big stretch to give Obama the Nobel peace prize for his “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between people” in 2009.

Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her work leading a youth campaign to halt climate change.
Three Norwegian lawmakers put forth the 16-year-old’s name.
“We have nominated Greta because the climate threat may be one of the most important causes of war and conflict,” parliamentary representative Freddy Andre Oevstegaard told Norwegian media outlet VG.
“The massive movement Greta has set in motion is a very important peace contribution,” he added.
The activist, who was named one of TIME’s Most Influential Teens of 2018, has inspired hundreds of thousands of students at schools around the world to hold strikes in an effort to urge their leaders to act.
According to a U.N. report, global temperatures could rise by 1.5°C, a threshold that scientists say will bring dire consequences to the planet, by as early as 2030 if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate.
In December 2018, Thunberg spoke at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Poland, where she called out lawmakers and government bodies for their inaction.
At a World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January, she ended her speech by telling a silenced room that she wants leaders to “behave like our house is on fire, because it is.”
As part of the #FridaysForFuture movement headed by the activist, tens of thousands of young people around the world will be skipping school this Friday to march for change.
Thunberg said on Twitter that almost 100 countries will be involved.
“I think we are only seeing the beginning. I think that change is on the horizon and the people will stand up for their future, Thunberg said in an interview with the Guardian.

His reputation as a tightwad was well earned. At breakfast with a reporter in 1993, at a suburban Philadelphia restaurant near Vanguard’s headquarters, Mr. Bogle figured out that he would beat the $5.95 cost of the buffet by ordering from the menu. If he had an early-morning meeting in New York, he would take the early Amtrak Metroliner shuttle rather than pay for a hotel room in Manhattan.
Image “John Bogle has changed a basic industry in the optimal direction,” the Nobel laureate Paul A. Samuelson wrote in a foreword to Mr. Bogle’s book “Bogle on Mutual Funds,” published in 1993.
Mr. Bogle readily took swipes at the press for lauding fund managers who temporarily got a hot hand, and for focusing heavily on a fund’s quarterly performance. Even a fund manager’s long-term record is not an accurate predictor of future performance, he said.
It was that combative nature that had led him to start Vanguard in the first place.
After graduating magna cum laude from Princeton in 1951 with an economics degree, Mr. Bogle was hired by Walter L. Morgan, founder of the Wellington Fund, a Philadelphia-based fund management company. Mr. Morgan had read Mr. Bogle’s senior thesis on mutual funds.
While working his way up at Wellington, Mr. Bogle persuaded Mr. Morgan to introduce a new all-equity fund, called the Windsor Fund, to complement Wellington, which invested in both stocks and bonds.
Mr. Bogle was named president of Wellington in 1967, and soon thereafter it merged with the Boston investment company Thorndike, Doran, Paine & Lewis. Several years later, a management dispute with the principals of the new company led Mr. Bogle to depart; he founded Vanguard in 1974 to handle the administrative functions of the mutual funds overseen by Wellington Management.
Two years later, Mr. Bogle founded the First Index Investment Trust, later called the Vanguard Index Trust, now known as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, the first index fund for individual investors. The next year he again broke from industry practice, selling mutual funds directly to investors rather than through brokers, and thus eliminating the sales fees of up to 9 percent that funds typically charged.

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Sept. 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Aeromics, Inc. ("Aeromics" or "the Company"), a privately-held, clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing first-in-class anti-edema therapies, announced today the appointment of Peter Agre, M.D. to its Board of Directors. Additionally, Dr. Agre will serve as Chair of the newly-formed Science and Technology Subcommittee of the Board of Directors.
Peter Agre, M.D.
Peter Agre, M.D. is a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute.
Dr. Agre received the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of the aquaporin water channels. Referred to as the "plumbing system of cells," aquaporins are responsible for moving water molecules through the cell membrane.
Aeromics is focused on controlling edema associated with various disease states through the development of inhibitors against aquaporin water channels. The Company believes Dr. Agre's stellar record as an administrator, researcher and scholar render him well qualified to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, and to Chair its Science and Technology Subcommittee. "As the discoverer of aquaporins and a decorated scientist, Peter brings unparalleled expertise and insight, particularly as we look to extend our leadership in the aquaporin field," said Jeffrey P. Draime, Chairman of the Board, Aeromics.
Dr. Agre was previously a Professor of Medicine and Biological Chemistry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (1992-05), Vice Chancellor for Science and Technology at Duke Medical Center (2005-07), and he served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2009-10).
Dr. Agre received his B.A. in Chemistry from Augsburg College in Minneapolis and his M.D. from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. He received clinical training in internal medicine and hematology and basic science training in cellular and molecular biology. His research has focused upon molecular aspects of human diseases, including hemolytic anemias, blood group antigens, and malaria.
"I am absolutely delighted to join the Board of Aeromics at such an exciting time for the Company as we prepare to initiate a Phase 2 trial in patients affected by disabling and life-threatening severe ischemic stroke," said Dr. Agre. "I look forward to working with the Board and the management team to chart our exciting future."
ABOUT STROKE
Every 50 seconds someone in the United States suffers from a stroke. Roughly 800,000 strokes are seen in the U.S. each year, of which approximately 692,000 are acute ischemic strokes. An estimated 140,000 patients with large hemispheric infarction suffer life-threatening and severely disabling cerebral edema, or brain swelling, and may benefit from an anti-edema medication. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels are the primary route of water movement into the central nervous system under conditions of ischemia.
ABOUT AER-271
AER-271 is a first-in-class, proprietary, intravenous (IV) prodrug that delivers AER-270, a potent inhibitor of AQP4 water channels. AER-271 is an investigational drug and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
ABOUT AEROMICS, INC.
Aeromics is a privately-held, clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to fundamentally changing the way in which various conditions resulting from the loss of water homeostasis are treated. The company has developed a proprietary platform based upon its expertise in aquaporin water channel biology.

STOCKHOLM (AP) — A winner of this year’s Nobel Prize for Economics who advocates carbon taxes as the best way to address greenhouse gas emissions says he does not expect U.S. President Donald Trump to back his view.
William Nordhaus’s comments to The Associated Press on Friday followed Trump’s recent dismissal of his own government’s report warning of the dire consequences of climate change.
“There will be no forward progress under the Trump administration; I think that’s virtually inconceivable,” Nordhaus said. “It will be good if it didn’t go backwards.”
Nordhaus will split the 9 million-kronor ($1 million) prize with another American, Paul Romer, who was recognized for his work on how markets can encourage innovation.
Carbon taxes, which involves the imposition of levies on companies that burn fossil fuel, are criticized as being detrimental to economic growth, according to opponents. And that’s a sensitive issue in the wake of the global economic downturn a decade ago.
“Nobody can predict with any accuracy what will happen in a year or two years,” he said at a news conference with Nordhaus and the winners of the physics and chemistry Nobels.
“On the other hand, everything in history suggests there will be another decline in output. I think we should expect that there will be additional financial crises.”
Two of the chemistry prize laureates said excessive concerns about genetically modified foods and other substances can inhibit mankind from benefiting from developments in the field.
“We’ve been modifying the biological world at the level of DNA for thousands of years,” said American Frances Arnold, citing examples such as new dog breeds. “Somehow there is this new fear of what we already have been doing and that fear has limited our ability to provide real solutions.”
“There’s a lot more we could do with directed evolution if there weren’t regulatory hurdles to doing it,” Britain’s Gregory Winter said. “If we want to do something about it we’ll have to loosen up some of these regimes.”
They were named winners along with American George Smith for advances that the award characterized as speeding up evolution of enzymes and proteins.
Arnold was one of two female winners of science Nobels this year. The other, Donna Strickland of Canada, said she sees progress in attracting women to traditionally male-dominated science, engineering and mathematics.
“I think women are going into most of the fields. Physics still lags behind and I don’t really know why that is the case; it depends, I think, a lot on whether society looks at physics as something to do,” she told the AP. She credited the popular TV program “The Big Bang Theory” as having “helped make physics seem cool.”
Strickland, Gerard Mourou of France and American Arthur Ashkin share the physics award for developments in lasers. Ashkin, at age 96 the oldest-ever Nobel winner, was unable to travel to Stockholm for Monday’s awards ceremony.
The Nobel Peace Prize will be presented on Monday in Oslo. No winner of the literature prize was named this year.

In 1991, Marc Abrahams founded the Ig Nobel Prize, a parody of the Nobel Prize ceremony that exalts obscure research in science. But his fascination for the funny and weird goes a long way back.
As a fourth-grader growing up in Swampscott, Abrahams was captivated by numbers, and an eccentric, joke-telling math teacher, Mrs. Bondelevitch, had a lot to do with it. His curiosity sparked, Abrahams turned to science and began collecting “weird stuff,” including a newspaper article with the headline, “Man Flushes Toilet, House Explodes,” which delighted his 10-year-old imagination.
On Thursday, Abrahams ’78, a Harvard graduate in applied mathematics, will revel in his role as emcee of the 29th First Ig Nobel Prize ceremony at Sanders Theatre, in an event that mixes comedy and science and celebrates unusual research. Le Monde called Abrahams “the pope of improbable science,” and the Washington Post dubbed him “the nation’s guru of academic grunge.”
Past winners include a Ukraine-born researcher who designed a bra that can be converted into a pair of gas masks; an Australian scientist who did a comprehensive survey of human belly-button lint; and a Spanish inventor who created a washing machine for cats and dogs.
“I’m getting to do as an adult all the things that I most enjoyed doing when I was a little kid,” said the editor and writer at his Cambridge home office, which is filled with Ig Nobel memorabilia.
Every year, Abrahams leads the uproarious gala like an experienced ringmaster, carefully orchestrating the night’s mischief, including the traditions of audience members throwing paper airplanes at the stage and genuine Nobel winners bestowing awards.
Among the laureates expected to attend this year are Eric Maskin, Adams University Professor and winner of the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences; Jerome Friedman, who won the 1990 Nobel Prize in physics; and Martin Chalfie, who won the 2008 Nobel in chemistry.
Held before the Nobel Prize awards, the Ig Nobel honors scientific achievements that “make people laugh, then think,” and highlights that there can be science even in absurd questions such as “Is a sigh ‘just a sigh’?” (Answer: No, it is an unintentional expression of negative emotions, including longing, boredom, disappointment, and defeat) or “Walking with coffee: Why does it spill?” (Answer: It’s the byproduct of the interplay between the motion of a cup and the low-viscosity liquid dynamics of what’s in it).
“We’re bringing attention to things that probably would not get much attention at all,” said Abrahams, co-founder and editor of the science humor magazine Improbable Research. “Nobel laureates get recognition, but there are millions of scientists who are advancing science, and most of them won’t get any attention at all.”
Take, for example, the team of doctors who studied the biomedical benefits and consequences of intense kissing, or the researchers who demonstrated that nearly all mammals empty their bladders in 21 seconds, or the scientists who examined how reindeer react to humans disguised as polar bears.
The Ig Nobel also honors creators who didn’t receive due recognition for their innovations. Among them are the inventor of karaoke, the three people who, probably, gave Murphy’s Law its name, and the man who, together with his father, obtained a patent for the comb-over.
Winning an Ig Nobel Prize is hard. Each year, Abrahams and a team of volunteers evaluate thousands of nominations. Some of those chosen decline the award for fear of public embarrassment, but most are thrilled and willing to pay the travel expenses to receive it in person.
The event has garnered prestige among scientists all over the world and has been popular since the first awards, held in an MIT classroom that could barely fit the crowd, mostly of amused scientists and science students. Three years later in 1994, it moved to Sanders, where it has been held before a packed audience every year.

Facebook has announced its cryptocurrency Libra on Tuesday and with it, the Mark Zuckerberg-founded company started doing rounds for all the wrong reasons. Drawing ire from economists, journalists and political activists alike, cryptocurrencies have found a new critic in Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize winning economist, who did not mince words in advocating against cryptocurrencies, the latest of which is Facebook’s Libra. “I actually think we should shut down the cryptocurrencies… it disturbs me a great deal that attention is given to cryptocurrencies because those were moving things off of a transparent platform into a dark platform,” the American economist told CNBC in an interview.
Explaining the perils of cryptocurrencies further, Joseph Stiglitz said that the world is already aware of the role that real estate played in money laundering. “We know from the Paradise papers and Panama papers the extent of money laundering. The large percentage of global wealth that is in these dark havens,” he added.
Joseph Stiglitz has been an active supporter of moving to an electronic payments mechanism.
“There are a lot of efficiencies; I think we can actually have a better-regulated economy if we had all the data in due time of what people are spending, it would enable the federal reserve to actually set interest rates in a much more efficient way; a better macroeconomic management,” he told the news channel. But in the case of cryptocurrencies, he strongly advocated against it and said that a way needs to be figured out for transparency of electronic payment mechanism without the dangers of surveillance and surveillance state.
Also, cryptocurrency does not hold up to the expectations of an efficient currency. “The US dollar has all the attributes of a good currency and the cryptocurrency do not have those attributes,” Joseph Stiglitz told the news channel stating that the country already has a stable currency in the form of the US dollar. “There is no need for anybody to go to a cryptocurrency,” he added.
Slated for an early launch in 2020, Libra aims at creating a low-cost global payment system available through smart devices. The currency is backed by over 25 partners which include names such as Visa, Mastercard, Uber and Spotify.

Akzo will focus on recouping its market share in products by targeting growth at 1.5x GDP for its premium product portfolio.
We recently met the management of Akzo Nobel India (Akzo). While the company’s brand strength among top paint companies remains unquestionable, Akzo is now focused on expanding its distribution network and footprint of tinting machines. From 1,000 additions a year, the company has started adding 2,000 tinting machines annually. While it has recently launched waterproofing products (under the brand Aquatech) in line with other paint companies, it continues to maintain low-key focus on low-value products such as putty and distemper.
Management plans to leverage global technology and improve efficiency in industrial paint segments to improve overall profitability. We maintain our estimates and expect consolidated sales and earnings CAGRs of 10.8% and 12.3% respectively over FY18-FY21e. Maintain Hold with a target price of Rs 1,720. At CMP, Akzo trades at 31.1x Sep’20e EPS, the lowest among its peers.
Focused on distribution and tinting machine additions
The company’s wholesale model has witnessed good traction and its distribution network has increased from 9,000 dealers and distributors in FY12 to 18,000 now.
Strong portfolio expansion
Akzo will focus on recouping its market share in products by targeting growth at 1.5x GDP for its premium product portfolio. Its share in premium category is double its overall market share.
Industrial paints—leveraging global technology; improving efficiency
Industrial paints contribute 35% to Akzo’s total revenues. In this segment, Akzo expects double-digit volume growth in auto refinish coatings, specialty coatings and powder coatings over the long term. Globally, AkzoNobel N.V. is a strong leader in several industrial paint segments due to its technology prowess, which management plans to leverage in India.

Stockholm — The Nobel Museum in Stockholm has been given Albert Einstein’s first paper published after he received the Nobel Prize in 1922, discussing his then still controversial relativity theory.
Swedish businessman Per Taube bought the handwritten two-page document at an auction for 1.2-million krona (€110,000) in December last year. He has now made good on his promise to gift the manuscript to the Nobel Museum, which will put it on display in a glass frame.
The paper, written in November 1922 while Einstein was attending conferences in Southeast Asia, was published a month later by the Prussian Academy of Sciences.
Incomprehensible to many, the text is a rebuttal of an article by German mathematician Erich Trefftz debating the “large-scale geometrical structure of the universe” — notably the forces and masses separating and enveloping celestial bodies.
Trefftz claimed he had found a “static” solution to Einstein’s theory of general relativity. However, Einstein rejected the hypothesis in a series of complex equations, concluding: “It became apparent ... that Trefftz’s solution does not permit this physical interpretation at all.”
Significantly, the document contains a modified version of the relativity theory and shows that Einstein was facing fierce resistance within the scientific community.
Scientific genius
“This letter shows that even though Albert Einstein had received the Nobel prize, his physics was very much part of the debate among scientists at the time and Albert Einstein himself was also part of this debate,” Gustav Källstrand, senior curator a the Nobel Prize museum, said.
Moreover, Einstein received the Nobel Prize of Physics on November 10 1922, for his discovery of the law of the photo-electric effect, not for the relativity theory.
The paper also has handwritten editor’s annotations by German physicist Max von Laue who won the Nobel Prize in 1914. Von Laue owned the manuscript until 1948 before it passed into the hands of private collectors.
For Källstrand, Einstein — who was born in 1879 and died in 1955 — remains “the archetypal image of a scientific genius”.
“If you say ‘scientist’, most people will get an image in their head of Albert Einstein.”

Story 129
A few weeks ago, American economist Richard Thaler became the winner of the 2017 Nobel for Economics. The award was for his ‘for his contributions to behavioural economics,’ something most of us can relate to in our own lives. Usually, this is not the case, and the prize is given for work that is not directly usable in our everyday lives. Last year, for instance, it was awarded for ‘contributions to contract theory’, and the year before, for ‘analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare’.Thaler’s work is different. The ‘default choice’ idea, which is the first principle of ‘choice architecture’ also works very well in a variety of ways in savings and investments. For instance, this lies at the heart of the extraordinary efficacy of the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) as a way of investing regularly and generating great returns from equity funds.The most common reason that investors get poor returns from relatively volatile investments like equities and equity funds is that they stop investing, or even disinvest, when markets drop. This is a natural reaction to the fact that the media presents falling stock prices as a crisis. However, this makes no sense. Whether you are buying shirts of stocks, lower prices are always better, provided you are buying quality stuff. SIPs solve this problem through being the kind of ‘default’ option that Thaler’s Choice Architecture contains. In SIPs, the default is to continue investing. Stopping it requires an action. Otherwise, the default is to not invest, and making an investment requires action. The difference in outcomes is obvious.Thaler’s idea of a ‘nudge’, which is also the title of a popular book he co-wrote, is something that we can use to modify our behaviour in matters both money-related and otherwise. What it all boils down to is not the choices themselves, but how the choices are framed and how they are presented. Thaler cites the Brexit referendum in the UK as an example. He says it could have gone the other way with just a few changes in the how the referendum ballot was worded. Not just after the Nobel, even earlier, there was a lot of interest around the world about how governments can use appropriately designed nudges to help people make better choices. This is true not only in matters related to personal finance and savings, but in many other areas as well.The UK government has something called the ‘Behavioural Insights Team’, which is unofficially known as the government’s ‘Nudge Unit’. This unit is headed by a psychologist and has suggested suggested a number of actions that the government has taken. These range from measures that increase the tax payment rate to reducing prescription errors in hospitals. By the way, back in 2012, the Government of India also tried to nudge people into equity investing by launching a bizarre scheme (Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme) whose nudge action was to get lots of demat accounts opened. Needless to say, it came a cropper.All this makes nudging sound like an easy and straightforward thing to do, especially in terms of investments and savings. However, there is always a ‘however’. The problem is that even before nudges are talked about, there are plenty of anti-nudges that have been deployed by those who stand to make money out of your personal finance decisions. It is an almost inviolable rule of personal finance that decisions that are better for savers and investors lead to lower income for financial intermediaries. If something nudges you to tell an insurance agent that you need to protect your family, you’ll receive suggestions about choosing a high-commission ULIP or endowment policy instead of the term insurance you actually need. If you have a large lump sum to invest, you will get a suggestion to put it all in an equity fund at one go instead of starting an SIP, because the former means a large immediate payout for the fund salesperson. As for the advice that is handed out for stock investing by brokers, the less said about it the better.All in all, the sellers and the advertisers of the world have cottoned on to Thaler’s ideas, probably long before Thaler himself got them. Unfortunately it’s hard to accomplish things that will reduce someone else’s income because your nudge will be faced with a much stronger anti-nudge. The idea of ‘nudging’ is basically about manipulating people with good intentions. In practice, only those who have enough knowledge and motivation to nudge themselves will have good outcomes.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Dan Makoski: The American has worked at tech giants Google and Microsoft
While I waiting for Dan Makoski at Lloyds Banking Group's headquarters in the City of London, its awards cabinet paints a picture.
The year 2016 was a good one for the group that runs Britain's giant banking brands, Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland.
It was highly commended as 'online banking provider of the year' and for 'innovation in personal finance', and took home the 'transformation award' from the UK customer excellence awards.
There are also some awards predating 2016, but since then ones conspicuous only through their absence.
Perhaps they retired or scrapped the awards, but you can't help feel maybe there's a coincidence between the recent lack of accolades for Lloyds' online offering and its decision a year ago to carve out a brand new role for a former Silicon Valley stalwart who's worked for both Google and Microsoft.
Makoski, 'the Google guy' appears, as you might expect, a slight fish out of water in the world of British banking.
He's clad in a pair of matt white glasses that look as if they ought to have the Apple logo stencilled onto them and wearing a pair of navy blue rubber brogues - a far cry from the pinstripe suits synonymous with banking in the city.
He's also slightly off-the-wall with his job description. His official title is chief design officer - but the reverse of his business card features something he's introduced to his new team: how you would describe your job in your own terms.
On his card, it says: 'Dan Makoski, chief goo obliterator'.
'Goo', he explains, 'is a catch-all term for the collection of things that slow us down.
'Some of that is actually really important to keeping us safe, and some of that is stuff we maybe don't need anymore in this 21st century.'
Makoski is no 'move fast and break things' Silicon Valley mad scientist though, even if he can't resist jumping up in the middle of the interview to begin scribbling on a whiteboard in the corner of the room.
'Starting to get into professor mode', he says in his soft American accent.
Despite being, in his own words, 'a reluctant banker', Makoski is more than capable of fitting into the corporate world.
He has 'sober inducing responsibilities around how we treat and serve customers', and stresses he's accountable to both the board and the executive committee.
'Goo obliterator': Dan explains the tongue-in-cheek title on the back of his business card is a 'catch all term for the collection of things that slow us down'
Makoski even ensures he quotes the bank's mission of 'helping Britain prosper' a number of times, though he at least laughs and admits: 'your bullsh*t meter and my bullsh*t meter probably went off when we first heard that mission, like do you really mean that?'
Though he insists Lloyds does.
Given how his back catalogue includes working on Google's Project Ara modular smartphone and the original Surface tablet, what brings someone who's been in Silicon Valley since the turn of the decade to a British bank, and a 324-year-old one at that?
Well this isn't Makoski's first foray into the world of finance.
Between 2014 and 2016 he spent two years at American credit card provider Capital One, as the company's first vice president of design.
'I'm insane twice', he says when he's asked about his time there. 'It's time to change banking for good', says the one-line description of his stint on LinkedIn.
His interest in banking he said, fittingly, began with a Google search.
'When I was at Google I did this search for "finances are..." he says, pulling out an iPad, a common prop he reaches for several more times over the course of our chat, 'and Google's auto-complete was a little bit of a data relevant snapshot of the current connection between people and money'.
Alerting users when they've received refunds is one of a number of updates Lloyds has made to its mobile banking since Makoski started in July 2018
The results he shows aren't positive; 'ruining my relationships', 'out of control' and 'stressing me out'.
At this point, he realised that 'the place that so few designers desire to work at is actually the place where design is needed the most'.
Scott Zimmer, who as Capital One's head of digital innovation and design hired Makoski alongside the bank's 45-person design team, said in 2014: 'the banking industry is behind the curve on user experience in the digital realm'.
Does Makoski agree? He sighs, 'yeah'.
What does think of the UK fintech space then – the challenger banks praised for forcing the established players to up their game when it comes to their digital offerings? Does he keep an eye trained on them?
'Too often, following the competition is a symptom of not having your own strategy.
Too often, following the competition is a symptom of not having your own strategy. Dan Makoski - chief design officer at Lloyds Banking Group
'There's been a couple of times in my career where I feel like we've just been what I call tail-light chasing.
'If you feel like there's someone that's ahead of you, well let me just follow where they're going, and if they go off a cliff, then you've lost your soul.'
Cynical observers might think Lloyds is taking more than inspiration from challenger banks like Monzo and Starling.
Halifax was recently accused of copying Monzo in a rejected mock-up of an app redesign, while Lloyds has unveiled a raft of new app features designed to give users real time alerts when they spend, get refunds or pay bills.
(It's worth noting the Halifax design was done by a third-party agency and was nothing to do with Makoski.)
It's also trialling a number of more advanced features, like rounding up card spending to the nearest pound and saving it, or alerting customers when a bill is higher than usual or when they're charged for the first time on a subscription.
And perhaps it ought to; in the latest round of switching figures Lloyds' three banks saw a net 29,000 customers go elsewhere in the last three months of 2018, while Monzo and Starling gained nearly 10,000 between them.
Just seven banks gained customers in the last three months of 2018 through CASS, with many of the UK's biggest current account providers shedding thousands of accounts
The changes provide a small insight into what Makoski is trying to do at Lloyds, but when he talks about good design in banking, what does he mean?
He pulls out a prototype of a bodyboard-shaped credit card from his Capital One days made from wood coated with silicon, with the holder's signature on it.
There's so much clutter in so much of what banking does in general. And Lloyds also suffers sometimes from well-intentioned but overly complicated experiences
'We were experimenting with creating things that felt a lot more personal than the crappy way my name is treated here', he makes the comparison with a regular Capital One credit card with the name printed on in metallic lettering.
Maybe it's a nice looking card, but what does it mean?
For Makoski 'it was a taste of what happens when you take design into a place where it's really needed.'
His approach to design, he says, 'is not pretentious or self-conscious or fussy or overly decorated' and 'ultimately it's action that I judge great design by, how does change the way you live in a positive way?'
Makoski is a fan of open banking, describing the idea as 'fascinating from a design perspective' - Lloyds' banking app allows users to view accounts from multiple banks
Right now, he says, 'there's so much clutter in so much of what banking does in general.
And Lloyds also suffers sometimes from well-intentioned but overly complicated experiences.'
He points to that staple of online banking as an example; the list of all your transactions.
'Not only does it show the amount and where it came from, but we also have a running tally, you know a minus this amount and here's your balance.
The amount of density we're showing, it's well-intentioned but when you have ordinary folks who are just trying to figure out how to manage their money - all this additional information is like the paradox of choice.'
But don't mistake his goal of greater simplicity for lack of ambition. Ask about his vision, about what he's after and he reaches straight for a metaphor: 'Think about what Nike+ did for running, I want to do that for banking.'
That means tailored, personalised user experience for each individual customer.
As he puts it, this means that if your bank knew you were likely to go into your overdraft based on your data, it'd nudge and remind you that 'you've got a couple of bills coming out next week, just a heads up.'
To carry on the Nike+ metaphor a little further, he sees it working when it comes to setting yourself goals – like losing weight or keeping fit, but when it comes to your money.
'Using data and a little bit of AI, using your transactions we can actually give you goals already tailored to your needs, based on what we've seen before.
'For example, "I want to spend this much less on this category over this time period". The more tangible those goals can be, the more likely you are to meet it.'
He concludes: 'To me, the future of banking isn't going to some provider that gives you this one account, it's actually whoever you trust to help you manage your life.'
While he left Silicon Valley in 2018, Makoski's last three employers have been Lloyds Banking Group, Walmart and Capital One.
Bank, supermarket, bank. After his talk about personalisation, and Zimmer's comments at Capital One about healing people's relationships with money, does he consider himself a consumer champion?
'I don't use that word much, it's kind of offensive, to think about them just as an economic unit.'
What does he prefer to consumer then?
'People,' he says. 'I don't want to be pretentious about that, but I say that because to me it's not about a commercial thing, it's about people.'
It's not wholly marketing fluff, even if it might sound it.
The room we're sitting in is testament to that.
It's light, with three big grey sofas and a couple of chairs and, most importantly, what looks like a two-way mirror from a police interview room at one end – directly behind where I'm sitting.
A black blind is pulled down over it as they try to assure me I'm not being watched, but watching is the point.
Makoski calls it 'co-creation', you could probably also call it people watching or focus grouping.
He calls some of the design team 'anthropologists…people who study people.' The principle is fairly straightforward, people are invited in and involved in the design process – to help the team think about what direction to take, he says.
Reaching for the iPad once more, he shows me one exercise that involved customers drawing out metaphors that applied to their finances like a game of Pictionary, 'fascinating, mostly negative', he says – an endless to-do list, an open prison, a leaking bucket.
'We already had some of this', he adds, 'but I amplified it, we doubled the size of the team and we're trying to make it so every single team involves everyday people in the process.'
Makoski admits he hasn't cracked anything yet, but you can see his logic about involving customers and a desire for greater personalisation reflected in some of the features Lloyds has already released. The big question, after whether it'll work, is how long it'll take.
Look through Makoski's history and you'll notice a pattern. Two years at Walmart, two years at Capital One, two years at Google, two years at Motorola, 'four projects in eight years' at Microsoft.
Makoski has done two-year stints at organisations for most of this decade, but at Lloyds he's taking a long-term view. 'A little bit more of a marathon and less of a sprint' he describes it as
That won't happen at Lloyds, not least because of his contract that means he's here for half a decade, but also because he admits 'this is a little bit more of a marathon and less of a sprint.'
It begs the question: having been here 10 months now, what does he hope to accomplish by the end of year two?
'I hope that we will have had not just one, but a consistent pattern of successful experiments that help some of our most vulnerable customers and customers that just don't understand the financial system and how to manage it.
I don't aspire to win a Nobel Prize, but if I did, this would be the project.
'I don't have the right to brag about anything we haven't yet created', he says, before seguing into an anecdote about being told off by his boss at Google for describing things as 'awesome' or 'amazing' too often.
Despite that, and despite going almost 55 minutes without promising anything too hyperbolic, he can't resist making a splash at the end.
'I know this is a little bit nuts, but I think this [his idea for the Nike+ of banking] is potentially the most valuable intellectual property this institution will have ever created.
'I don't aspire to win a Nobel Prize, but if I did, this would be the project.'
Perhaps then, if the work of the mad scientist and his design lab team works out the way he hopes, his card in 2024 will say something slightly different: Dan Makoski, Nobel Peace Prize for services to goo obliteration.
Or maybe just a few more additions to that trophy cabinet for starters.

'Too often, following the competition is a symptom of not having your own strategy.
Too often, following the competition is a symptom of not having your own strategy. Dan Makoski - chief design officer at Lloyds Banking Group
'There's been a couple of times in my career where I feel like we've just been what I call tail-light chasing.
'If you feel like there's someone that's ahead of you, well let me just follow where they're going, and if they go off a cliff, then you've lost your soul.'
Cynical observers might think Lloyds is taking more than inspiration from challenger banks like Monzo and Starling.
Halifax was recently accused of copying Monzo in a rejected mock-up of an app redesign, while Lloyds has unveiled a raft of new app features designed to give users real time alerts when they spend, get refunds or pay bills.
(It's worth noting the Halifax design was done by a third-party agency and was nothing to do with Makoski.)
It's also trialling a number of more advanced features, like rounding up card spending to the nearest pound and saving it, or alerting customers when a bill is higher than usual or when they're charged for the first time on a subscription.
And perhaps it ought to; in the latest round of switching figures Lloyds' three banks saw a net 29,000 customers go elsewhere in the last three months of 2018, while Monzo and Starling gained nearly 10,000 between them.
Just seven banks gained customers in the last three months of 2018 through CASS, with many of the UK's biggest current account providers shedding thousands of accounts
The changes provide a small insight into what Makoski is trying to do at Lloyds, but when he talks about good design in banking, what does he mean?
He pulls out a prototype of a bodyboard-shaped credit card from his Capital One days made from wood coated with silicon, with the holder's signature on it.
There's so much clutter in so much of what banking does in general. And Lloyds also suffers sometimes from well-intentioned but overly complicated experiences
'We were experimenting with creating things that felt a lot more personal than the crappy way my name is treated here', he makes the comparison with a regular Capital One credit card with the name printed on in metallic lettering.
Maybe it's a nice looking card, but what does it mean?
For Makoski 'it was a taste of what happens when you take design into a place where it's really needed.'
His approach to design, he says, 'is not pretentious or self-conscious or fussy or overly decorated' and 'ultimately it's action that I judge great design by, how does change the way you live in a positive way?'
Makoski is a fan of open banking, describing the idea as 'fascinating from a design perspective' - Lloyds' banking app allows users to view accounts from multiple banks
Right now, he says, 'there's so much clutter in so much of what banking does in general.
And Lloyds also suffers sometimes from well-intentioned but overly complicated experiences.'
He points to that staple of online banking as an example; the list of all your transactions.
'Not only does it show the amount and where it came from, but we also have a running tally, you know a minus this amount and here's your balance.
The amount of density we're showing, it's well-intentioned but when you have ordinary folks who are just trying to figure out how to manage their money - all this additional information is like the paradox of choice.'
But don't mistake his goal of greater simplicity for lack of ambition. Ask about his vision, about what he's after and he reaches straight for a metaphor: 'Think about what Nike+ did for running, I want to do that for banking.'
That means tailored, personalised user experience for each individual customer.
As he puts it, this means that if your bank knew you were likely to go into your overdraft based on your data, it'd nudge and remind you that 'you've got a couple of bills coming out next week, just a heads up.'
To carry on the Nike+ metaphor a little further, he sees it working when it comes to setting yourself goals – like losing weight or keeping fit, but when it comes to your money.
'Using data and a little bit of AI, using your transactions we can actually give you goals already tailored to your needs, based on what we've seen before.
'For example, "I want to spend this much less on this category over this time period". The more tangible those goals can be, the more likely you are to meet it.'
He concludes: 'To me, the future of banking isn't going to some provider that gives you this one account, it's actually whoever you trust to help you manage your life.'
While he left Silicon Valley in 2018, Makoski's last three employers have been Lloyds Banking Group, Walmart and Capital One.
Bank, supermarket, bank. After his talk about personalisation, and Zimmer's comments at Capital One about healing people's relationships with money, does he consider himself a consumer champion?
'I don't use that word much, it's kind of offensive, to think about them just as an economic unit.'
What does he prefer to consumer then?
'People,' he says. 'I don't want to be pretentious about that, but I say that because to me it's not about a commercial thing, it's about people.'
It's not wholly marketing fluff, even if it might sound it.
The room we're sitting in is testament to that.
It's light, with three big grey sofas and a couple of chairs and, most importantly, what looks like a two-way mirror from a police interview room at one end – directly behind where I'm sitting.
A black blind is pulled down over it as they try to assure me I'm not being watched, but watching is the point.
Makoski calls it 'co-creation', you could probably also call it people watching or focus grouping.
He calls some of the design team 'anthropologists…people who study people.' The principle is fairly straightforward, people are invited in and involved in the design process – to help the team think about what direction to take, he says.
Reaching for the iPad once more, he shows me one exercise that involved customers drawing out metaphors that applied to their finances like a game of Pictionary, 'fascinating, mostly negative', he says – an endless to-do list, an open prison, a leaking bucket.
'We already had some of this', he adds, 'but I amplified it, we doubled the size of the team and we're trying to make it so every single team involves everyday people in the process.'
Makoski admits he hasn't cracked anything yet, but you can see his logic about involving customers and a desire for greater personalisation reflected in some of the features Lloyds has already released. The big question, after whether it'll work, is how long it'll take.
Look through Makoski's history and you'll notice a pattern. Two years at Walmart, two years at Capital One, two years at Google, two years at Motorola, 'four projects in eight years' at Microsoft.
Makoski has done two-year stints at organisations for most of this decade, but at Lloyds he's taking a long-term view. 'A little bit more of a marathon and less of a sprint' he describes it as
That won't happen at Lloyds, not least because of his contract that means he's here for half a decade, but also because he admits 'this is a little bit more of a marathon and less of a sprint.'
It begs the question: having been here 10 months now, what does he hope to accomplish by the end of year two?
'I hope that we will have had not just one, but a consistent pattern of successful experiments that help some of our most vulnerable customers and customers that just don't understand the financial system and how to manage it.
I don't aspire to win a Nobel Prize, but if I did, this would be the project.
'I don't have the right to brag about anything we haven't yet created', he says, before seguing into an anecdote about being told off by his boss at Google for describing things as 'awesome' or 'amazing' too often.
Despite that, and despite going almost 55 minutes without promising anything too hyperbolic, he can't resist making a splash at the end.
'I know this is a little bit nuts, but I think this [his idea for the Nike+ of banking] is potentially the most valuable intellectual property this institution will have ever created.
'I don't aspire to win a Nobel Prize, but if I did, this would be the project.'
Perhaps then, if the work of the mad scientist and his design lab team works out the way he hopes, his card in 2024 will say something slightly different: Dan Makoski, Nobel Peace Prize for services to goo obliteration.
Or maybe just a few more additions to that trophy cabinet for starters.

Dutch chemicals company Nouryon BV plans to continue raising prices, boost productivity and increase production capacity in preparation for a potential stock-market listing.
Amsterdam-based Nouryon was spun out of coatings and paint maker Akzo Nobel NV and acquired by U.S. private-equity house Carlyle Group LP and Singapore’s GIC Private Ltd. this year, employing about 10,000 people world-wide.
Similar to peers including German chemicals firms BASF SE and Covestro AG, Nouryon has been suffering from rising raw material and energy costs over the course of the year. The chlorine manufacturer, which also produces performance chemicals used in athletic shoe soles and wall paint, is looking to further hike prices to offset those cost increases, Chief Financial Officer Renier Vree said in an interview with CFO Journal.
Nouryon has increased prices for its products on average by 7% since the beginning of the year, said Mr. Vree, adding that these increases don’t suffice to compensate for the rise in raw material costs.
“I think there is room for more,” he said. “I am the type of CFO that likes to get involved in these questions.” Mr. Vree declined to comment on how much the company could raise prices in 2019.
In about 80% of product categories that it is competing in, Nouryon comes first or second in terms of sales, providing the company with leverage over its customers, said Markus Mayer, an analyst at Baader Bank AG in Munich.
“Nouryon has a lot of pricing power, especially in areas like chlorine and caustic soda,” he said. Caustic soda is used for manufacturing pulp, paper, soap and detergents, among other products.
A potentially worsening of the global economic outlook—driven in part by the trade dispute between the U.S. and China and events such as Britain’s exit from the European Union—might make that task more challenging. Everyone in the industry is trying to raise prices now, Mr. Mayer said. “The move might be met with resistance from customers.”
Mr. Vree next year aims to raise Nouryon’s productivity and to reallocate capital spending toward new manufacturing sites for its specialty chemicals business. Forty percent of the company’s plants are running at full capacity, he said. Mr. Vree didn’t provide more specifics on where Nouryon could expand its footprint. The company is producing at 68 sites in countries around the world, including Brazil, the U.S., Germany, Sweden and China.
These measures could help ready the company for a change in ownership. “Down the road, the idea is that there could be an initial public offering,” said Mr. Vree, adding that the listing could happen in five years or less. He didn’t provide more specifics.
Capital expenditures at Nouryon are set to remain stable at about 6% of annual sales in 2019, Mr. Vree said.
Nouryon is looking for ways to offset wage inflation in the U.S. and in Europe, he said. Labor costs will rise 3% to 3.5% in 2019, according to Mr. Vree. The company has lifted wages in various countries, including the U.S., where salaries this year went up by an average of 3.3%.
Back-office functions like finance, human resources, information technology and legal contribute to the cost-saving efforts, Mr. Vree said. The chemicals maker is in the process of centralizing some of its accounting tasks in three main shared services centers in Mexico, China and the Netherlands.
Mr. Vree declined to comment on what these changes would mean for the company’s nearly 500 finance employees. The company didn’t disclose how many HR, IT and procurement workers it employs in its shared services centers. These are separate from the finance workers, a spokesman said.

Story 137
Jean-Claude Arnault, the man at the centre of a sexual abuse and financial misconduct scandal that forced the postponement of this year’s Nobel prize in literature, has been convicted of rape.
In a unanimous verdict, Stockholm district court sentenced Arnault – the husband of a member of the Swedish Academy, which awards the world’s most prestigious literary prize – to two years in prison, the minimum sentence.
The judge, Gudrun Antemar, said there was “sufficient evidence, consisting mainly of statements during the trial by the injured party and several witnesses”, to convict the defendant of one of the two counts of rape with which he had been charged.
The verdict came at the start of Nobel prize week, shortly before the award for medicine was announced.
Arnault’s lawyer, Björn Hurtig, earlier told local media his client would appeal if convicted. He has said his client strenuously denies all charges against him, describing them as a witch-hunt based on fundamentally flawed evidence.
After a trial held behind closed doors, the public prosecutor, Christina Voigt, had called for the Frenchman to be sentenced to at least three years in jail. The maximum sentence for rape in Sweden is six years.
Arnault, 72, an influential figure in Sweden’s cultural scene for many decades, faced charges of forcing a woman to engage in oral sex and intercourse in a Stockholm apartment on 5 October 2011, and of raping her again on 2 December in the same apartment while she was asleep.
In a statement, the court said Arnault, who reportedly bragged of being the academy’s “19th member”, had been found guilty on the first count and acquitted on the second. “The injured party has been awarded compensation for damages,” it added.
The scandal first erupted last November when the Dagens Nyheter newspaper published detailed allegations by 18 women accusing Arnault – who describes himself as a photographer – of rape, sexual harassment, physical abuse and harassment over a period of more than 20 years, in Sweden and France.
Eight women filed formal complaints, but all bar one of the cases were subsequently dropped for lack of evidence or because they had exceeded the statute of limitations.
The woman in the case that came to trial – a writer and academic – told police of the 2011 assaults a few days after the Dagens Nyheter report was published, saying she had not come forward earlier because Arnault was a good friend of her manager.
Bitter internal disputes over how to handle the accusations against Arnault led to the departure of seven of the academy’s 18 members, including his wife, Katarina Frostenson, a poet and playwright who stepped down in April at the same time as the organisation’s then permanent secretary, Sara Danius.
In May, the academy – which was founded by King Gustav III in 1786 and is still under royal patronage – announced that in view of its “currently diminished” membership and the public’s “reduced confidence” in its deliberations, it would not be awarding a prize this year. Two laureates are to be announced in 2019.
For many years, Arnault and Frostenson ran Forum, a club in Stockholm that showcased exhibitions and readings by prominent cultural personalities including Nobel laureates. The club was partly funded by the academy, prompting secondary allegations of a conflict of interest.
As the scandal unfolded, Dagens Nyheter also reported that an internal investigation by the academy had concluded Arnault may have leaked the names of seven Nobel literature laureates – the subject of heavy betting – in advance of their announcement, including those of Bob Dylan in 2016 and Harold Pinter in 2005.

A team of former U.S. government intelligence operatives working for the United Arab Emirates hacked into the iPhones of activists, diplomats and rival foreign leaders with the help of a sophisticated spying tool called Karma, in a campaign that shows how potent cyber-weapons are proliferating beyond the world's superpowers and into the hands of smaller nations. The cyber tool allowed the small Gulf country to monitor hundreds of targets beginning in 2016, from the Emir of Qatar and a senior Turkish official to a Nobel Peace laureate human-rights activist in Yemen, according to five former operatives and program documents reviewed by Reuters. The sources interviewed by Reuters were not Emirati citizens. Karma was used by an offensive cyber operations unit in Abu Dhabi comprised of Emirati security officials and former American intelligence operatives working as contractors for the UAE's intelligence services. The existence of Karma and of the hacking unit, code named Project Raven, haven't been previously reported. Raven's activities are detailed in a separate story published by Reuters today. The ex-Raven operatives described Karma as a tool that could remotely grant access to iPhones simply by uploading phone numbers or email accounts into an automated targeting system. The tool has limits — it doesn't work on Android devices and doesn't intercept phone calls. But it was unusually potent because, unlike many exploits, Karma did not require a target to click on a link sent to an iPhone, they said. In 2016 and 2017, Karma was used to obtain photos, emails, text messages and location information from targets' iPhones. The technique also helped the hackers harvest saved passwords, which could be used for other intrusions. It isn't clear whether the Karma hack remains in use. The former operatives said that by the end of 2017, security updates to Apple Inc's iPhone software had made Karma far less effective. Lori Stroud, a former Raven operative who also previously worked at the U.S. National Security Agency, told Reuters of the excitement when Karma was introduced in 2016. "It was like, 'We have this great new exploit that we just bought. Get us a huge list of targets that have iPhones now,'" she said. "It was like Christmas."

The disclosure of Karma and the Raven unit comes amid an escalating cyber arms race, with rivals such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE competing for the most sophisticated hacking tools and personnel. Tools like Karma, which can exploit hundreds of iPhones simultaneously, capturing their location data, photos and messages, are particularly sought-after, veterans of cyberwarfare say. Only about 10 nations, such as Russia, China and the United States and its closest allies, are thought to be capable of developing such weapons, said Michael Daniel, a former White House cyber security czar under President Obama. Karma and similar tools make personal devices like iPhones the "juiciest of targets," said Patrick Wardle, a former National Security Agency researcher and Apple security expert. A spokeswoman for UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. Apple declined to comment.
A flaw in Apple's iMessage system
The former Raven insiders said Karma allowed the operatives to gather evidence on scores of targets — from activists critical of the government to regional rivals, including Qatar, and the UAE's ideological opponent, the Islamic political Muslim Brotherhood movement. It also granted them access to compromising and at times sexually explicit photos of targets. The material was described to Reuters in detail but reporters didn't inspect it. Reuters saw no evidence that the UAE leaked damaging materials discovered through Karma. Raven was largely staffed by U.S. intelligence community veterans, who were paid through an Emirati cyber security firm named DarkMatter, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The company did not respond to numerous emails and phone calls requesting comment. The NSA declined to comment on Project Raven. The UAE government purchased Karma from a vendor outside the country, the operatives said. Reuters could not determine the tool's creator. The operatives knew how to use Karma, feeding it new targets daily, in a system requiring almost no input after an operative set its target. But the users did not fully understand the technical details of how the tool managed to exploit Apple vulnerabilities. People familiar with the art of cyber espionage said this isn't unusual in a major signals intelligence agency, where operators are kept in the dark about most of what the engineers know of a weapon's inner workings. Three former operatives said they understood Karma to rely, at least in part, on a flaw in Apple's messaging system, iMessage. They said the flaw allowed for the implantation of malware on the phone through iMessage, even if the phone's owner didn't use the iMessage program, enabling the hackers to establish a connection with the device. To initiate the compromise, Karma needed only to send the target a text message — the hack then required no action on the part of the recipient. The operatives could not determine how the vulnerability worked. A person with direct knowledge of the deal confirmed Karma's sale to the Emiratis from an outside vendor, details of its capabilities and its reliance on an iMessage vulnerability. The Raven team successfully hacked into the accounts of hundreds of prominent Middle East political figures and activists across the region and, in some cases, Europe, according to former Raven operatives and program documents.

Well, it looks as if policy debates over the next couple of years will be at least somewhat affected by the doctrine of Modern Monetary Theory, which some progressives appear to believe means that they don’t need to worry about how to pay for their initiatives. That’s actually wrong even if you set aside concerns about MMT analysis, which is something I’ll write about in a companion piece. But first it seems to me that I need to set out what’s right and what’s wrong about MMT.
Unfortunately, that’s a very hard argument to have – modern MMTers are messianic in their claims to have proved even conventional Keynesianism wrong, tend to be unclear about what exactly their differences with conventional views are, and also have a strong habit of dismissing out of hand any attempt to make sense of what they’re saying. The good news is that MMT seems to be pretty much the same thing as Abba Lerner’s “functional finance” doctrine from 1943. And Lerner was admirably clear, making it easy to see both the important virtues of and the problems with his argument.
So what I want to do in this note is explain why I’m not a full believer in Lerner’s functional finance; I think this critique applies to MMT as well, although if past debates are any indication, I will promptly be told that I don’t understand, am a corrupt tool of the oligarchy, or something.
OK, Lerner: His argument was that countries that (a) rely on fiat money they control and (b) don’t borrow in someone else’s currency don’t face any debt constraints, because they can always print money to service their debt. What they face, instead, is an inflation constraint: too much fiscal stimulus will cause an overheating economy. So their budget policies should be entirely focused on getting the level of aggregate demand right: the budget deficit should be big enough to produce full employment, but no so big as to produce inflationary overheating.

Story 140
The Tufts Daily (TD): What were some memorable classes or professors you had at Tufts?
Eugene Fama (EF): I started out as a Romance languages major and then took an economics course, and I loved it, and ended up with a dual major. I fell in love with economics and I’ve been with it ever since. Harry Ernst was a very important professor, though he’s probably dead at this point. Lewis Manly was another one who was very good. I’m sure he’s dead at this point.
TD: What personally motivated your path from studying Romance languages at Tufts to loving economics so much that it brought you to where you are today?
EF: Well, I was getting bored with Romance languages, and I found economics exciting. When I went to interview for a job, it looked like a degree in economics would be much more profitable. But in any case, I wasn’t ready for a job, so I wanted to go to graduate school, and my professors at that time, Harry Ernst and Lewis Manly, [told] me to go to the University of Chicago, because they thought that was the business school that was more oriented towards academic work than the other schools I had been accepted to.
TD: What research are you currently working on?
EF: I’ve worked on lots of things since [receiving the Nobel Prize], and I’m currently working on how to measure risk and what the relationship is between expected return and risk. [That’s] the most simple way to put it; getting into any more detail than that would be probably not be appropriate for your audience.
TD: What do you believe is the most misunderstood facet of your work?
EF: Whether you’re talking about academics or practitioners. Academics understand it perfectly well, I think. Whether they agree with it or not, that’s a different story, but they understand it. Practitioners, well, they all have their own quirks, so I can’t really comment on that. It took a long time for these ideas to percolate through the business community. It basically took 50 years for the efficient markets hypothesis to permeate in any real way, but the risk and return stuff that I’ve been doing forever — that permeated pretty quickly.
TD: Is there any reason you think practitioners misunderstood?
EF: [Practitioners didn’t misunderstand], they just didn’t accept it because it hits them in the pocketbook. Basically it said that all of the active investing techniques did not work. You’re crazy to pay high fees for them when in fact you weren’t getting what you were paying for. So they didn’t like that message.
TD: What would you most like to understand or explain about financial markets that you feel has not yet been understood?
EF: Almost everything. The appropriate way to measure risk. I mean, I’ve been looking at this risk-return problem for 50 years, and I still don’t think I have it nailed. I doubt it’s possible to nail it, so that’s kind of ongoing research, and it’s likely to be ongoing long after I’m done with it.
TD: In light of the 2008 global financial crisis, do you tend to believe that regulation improved the financial sector or that it went too far?
EF: No, I don’t think it went too far. I would say that in some respects it went too far, but in some respects it didn’t go far enough. I think it’s still dangerous in terms of the amount of leverage that’s in our financial sector. If there were another crisis, [financial institutions] would get bailed out again, and that’s something that they like, so there have been some of us that have said all along that basically the ones that are too big to fail should hold enough equity so that they can’t fail. But we’re nowhere near that. We’re still in a fairly dangerous position if we run into another episode like they did in 2008 and 2009.
TD: So you believe there could be room for further regulation?
EF: Well, they looked at the wrong stuff. They’re looking at detailed regulation when the basic regulation is [that] you have to have enough equity in there so that the debt doesn’t bring you down. I don’t think they really faced that, because they get lulled by the interest into thinking that somehow more leverage will hamstring the banks in what they do in terms of lending, [but] there’s an old Modigliani-Miller theorem that says that’s garbage. Basically, it could be all equity, and it wouldn’t change the amount of lending they would do. That’s going to be an ongoing fight, and hopefully not [one] to be tested with another crisis.
TD: Critics of passive investing have raised concerns about a concentration of voting rights. In your view, should passive shareholders be allowed to vote and why?
EF: Of course they should be. They’re shareholders after all. So I’m involved with an investment company, and we have 15 people who do nothing but look at these governance issues. So the bigger the fraction you own of a company, the more incentive you have to make sure that what they’re doing is something you agree with in terms of making sure the shareholders are better off. So I don’t see a problem there at all. It’s the opposite of a problem. The problem you have is the free-rider problem, where everybody owns such a small fraction and nobody has any incentive to be looking into what’s going on. So I think all of the passive managers that I know of are deep into corporate governance; I mean, they’re really concerned about how a company is operating. You get complaints from people who want us to go back to active management, so they can get back their high fees. [Passive managers] are the same as active guys. The incentive is not different. You don’t want these [active] guys stealing from you; that’s what it comes down to.
TD: Do you believe that at the limit there will always be room for active investors as necessary price-setters for the market?
EF: There’s definitely a need for them, but the problem is that all the bad active managers have to be offset by good active managers. So if the bad ones dropped out, there’d be fewer good ones to offset them and keep the market efficient. So I don’t think we are anywhere near the point where this is at all an issue. There are active managers who do it anyway, but it could be just informed individual investors that keep the market efficient.
TF: What is one piece of advice you would give to young people seeking to enter the finance industry, especially in investment roles?
EF: Well, my general advice that I always give to young people is: Find something that you really like to do, because you’re going to spend a large fraction of your life doing it. And if you don’t like it, basically, it’s a third of your life; you’re going to be very unhappy. So I’ve been really blessed in the sense that I really love my work, so it’s not painful to sit down at my desk and work. It’s really a joy. That’s the general advice I give, and it would apply to people going into finance as well. If you’re going to go into finance, basically you need a good background in economics and some background in statistics. Those are the two things you’re going to be faced with throughout your career. I try to prepare my students in those terms for stuff that they’re likely to see in the future that we don’t even know about now. So, if they’re going to be prepared to deal with it, they are going to need a background in economics and statistics to do that.
TD: What advice would you give to students graduating today in light of today’s economic environment and the growing challenges to traditional views of capitalism, markets and globalization?
EF: It’s really baffling that somehow evidence doesn’t seem to change people’s opinions. What is the government really good at? I mean, why are you asking for more government? Does more government ever work? Or does it always work in unintended ways? I tend to lean to the latter myself, but I’m a libertarian, so I don’t trust [government]. But basically, the evidence is clear-cut. Capitalism makes people better off. There’s no way around it. There’s a lot of envy going around, because the rich are doing very well. The poor are doing well, it’s just that they are not doing as well as the rich. I don’t know what the optimal amount of inequality is in order to make everybody better off. And that’s not a question that can be answered by the political process very well, either. But it really worries me that people don’t seem to learn from experience that socialism and more government basically were a complete disaster. There is no case of a socialist government that has ever worked in the long-term. So I don’t know what people are looking at. Socialism depends on people. Eventually you’re gonna get people in there who are going to steal everything. You see that in Venezuela currently; you saw that in the Soviet Union … So we’ll see how that turns out.

BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Social enterprises run by women and young people can fix the world’s most pressing problems - from climate change to wealth inequality - because they are often closest to such issues, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus said on Thursday.
FILE PHOTO: Muhammad Yunus, Bangladeshi economist and 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, speaks on eradicating malnutrition at the opening of a food production plant in Barreal de Heredia, near San Jose, November 25, 2013. REUTERS/Juan Carlos Ulate
Bangladesh’s Yunus won the Nobel prize in 2006 jointly with Grameen Bank, the microfinance organization he founded. He has since turned his attention to social businesses that he said are better equipped to solve some of the world’s biggest challenges.
Social businesses – which are set up specifically to tackle social and environmental problems through commercial means – are mushrooming across the world, with even large companies wanting to show they care about people and the planet.
But it’s women and young people who can have the most impact, Yunus told the Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of a social business event in Bangkok.
“Social businesses are growing because people are frustrated with the conventional economy, the old way of doing business, which is not delivering results in areas like sanitation, waste management, green energy, and affordable healthcare,” he said.
“Women and young people perhaps understand these problems better because they are most affected by them. Social business can fix any problem, and anyone can just jump in and get started without waiting for the government or big donors.”
Nicknamed “banker to the poor”, Yunus started his movement 40 years ago with loans worth just $27 to women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, to help them escape what he described as a relationship of “slavery” with loan sharks.
Grameen Bank has since delivered millions of tiny loans to poor people who do not have access to mainstream banking.
Yunus’s first foray into social enterprises was with French food giant Danone in Bangladesh to develop a local option to expensive imported baby food.
Grameen Danone now makes an affordable and nutritious yogurt for malnourished children. Grameen Bank has also tied up with apparel maker Uniqlo, technology company Intel, and waste management firm Veolia for other social business ventures.
“Businesses are interested because they want to be seen as caring, and fixing problems they themselves may have helped create,” Yunus said.
“But not everyone has to work for a big business - that’s the traditional approach. Instead, we should all be entrepreneurs and use technology, and our creativity and energy to solve problems,” he added.
This will also help narrow the widening wealth gap - which Yunus said is a “ticking time bomb” that can cause greater social and economic unrest if left unaddressed.
Some countries in Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines have passed legislation or revised laws to support social business ventures.
But what’s more important is adapting educational institutions and the financial system to encourage entrepreneurship and social business, Yunus said.
“We need a new economic structure to fix problems,” he said. “If we go down the same old path, we will arrive at the same old destination. To solve today’s problems, we need new paths.”

The Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller has said bitcoin will not be a “permanent feature” of the financial world, as politicians indicated that a clampdown on cryptocurrencies was coming.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Shiller hailed bitcoin as a “really clever idea”. But although he was impressed with the technology behind it, he was concerned that it had “gone viral as a currency”.
“I tend to think of bitcoin as an experiment. It is an interesting experiment, but it’s not a permanent feature of our lives,” said Shiller, who has previously warned that the bitcoin price could collapse. “We are over-emphasising bitcoin, we should expand it out to blockchain, which will have other applications.”
Theresa May said in Davos that she was concerned that criminals were taking advantage of digital currencies, which can be used to anonymously transfer funds. “In areas like cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously,” May told Bloomberg.
The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, also flagged up concerns about misuse of digital currencies. “My number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities,” Mnuchin told CNBC. “So in the US our regulations [say] if you’re a bitcoin wallet, you’re subject to the same regulations as a bank.”
South Korea has recently announced a clampdown on digital currencies. From next month, people will be banned from using anonymous bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading.
Digital currencies have been a key topic of conversation at Davos. Ethereum, a rival to bitcoin, has set up its own lounge on the main promenade of the ski resort. Banks are showing particular interest in the blockchain – the digital ledger that underpins a cryptocurrency.

A senior Swedish central banker said bitcoin was too volatile to be classed as money. “In my view, cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and the others, the way I’ve seen them so far, they don’t meet the criteria to be called money,” said Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor of the Riksbank.
“They are not a very stable store of value – they fluctuate a lot – and it’s not a very efficient medium of exchange because you don’t buy your groceries with bitcoin, you don’t get your salaries in bitcoin, and you certainly can’t pay your taxes with bitcoin.”
Skingsley said she understood that digital currencies were attractive in countries where people did not trust the public authorities, but she said bitcoin was a “poor alternative” as it was too volatile.
“If you’re talking of money in an efficient economy, over time it’s much better if you have a trustworthy authority that releases enough money – not too little and not too much,” Skingsley said.
However, some investors at Davos disputed the idea that bitcoin faced a rocky future. Jennifer Zhu Scott, of Radian Partners, said bitcoin was a “very lousy currency” and a “very lousy payment system” but insisted that it worked as an asset. “I don’t think bitcoin is disrupting currency or money. Bitcoin is disrupting gold,” she said.
Zhu argued that bitcoin was extremely efficient as a store of value, as there could only ever be 21m in circulation – and only about 16m have been created so far.
Neil Rimer, a general partner at Index Ventures, conceded that bitcoin could theoretically crash to zero, but he also hailed the progress since it was created nine years ago. “This is one of the most audacious, generous and profound inventions that I have witnessed in my career. It does have the ability to help many, many people,” he said.

At first sight, the two awardees, William Nordhaus and Paul Romer, work on very different things.
This year’s economics “Nobel” prize (the quotes remind us that it is not one of the original prizes endowed by Alfred Nobel) is particularly satisfying for professional economists, and at the same time extraordinarily relevant for countries like India that seek to grow quickly but sustainably.
At first sight, the two awardees, William Nordhaus and Paul Romer, work on very different things. Nordhaus has spent most of his career building models that seek to quantify the economic costs and benefits of policies to deal with climate change and related environmental issues. Romer is best known for his work on the role of innovation in economic growth. The two economists were linked in the prize committee’s citation by their focus on long-run growth, or, as the committee put it, “long-run macroeconomic analysis.” Both of them sought to further the connection in their post-prize comments: Nordhaus mentioned his early work on innovation, and Romer pronounced on the importance of dealing with climate change.
Given the importance of technological change and climate change in the global economy, now and in the foreseeable future, rewarding work on these topics is obviously relevant. I return to that later in this column. What I want to highlight first is how the two prize recipients illustrate different, but equally important and complementary ways of doing economics. I think it is fair to say that Nordhaus has not given us any fundamentally new economic insights. In a post-announcement talk, he spoke of “side effects,” or, what economists call “externalities” or “spillovers.” The presence of these effects in climate change and a host of environmental issues means markets do not do an optimal job of resource allocation, and require difficult policy responses, especially when tackled at a global level. Nordhaus has spent decades building and refining large models that can use data from climate and other scientists to quantify costs and benefits of different economic policies, and guide policymakers. Building good empirical models is an important strain of work in the economics profession.
In my view, Romer’s contribution is quite different in style. He certainly looks at the data. But what it leads him to are sharp and deep insights into “how things work.” His original observation that knowledge, in the form of blueprints or instructions or formulas, introduces increasing returns to scale in an inescapable manner, at a stroke provided a rigorous answer to the puzzle that previous economic models of growth had posed—in those models, growth in output per capita would inevitably die out because of diminishing returns. Once innovations that add to our stock of knowledge are properly incorporated into descriptions of the production process, this puzzle goes away. Of course, Romer did more than provide a simple insight—he worked out its implications in many different kinds of economic situations, and provided at least qualitative guideposts for economic policy with respect to supporting innovation.
Nordhaus’s and Romer’s professional personas have also been different, matching the styles of their work. Nordhaus has been quiet and uncontroversial. Romer, on the other hand, has been bold in challenging conceptual models in international trade, but especially in macroeconomics, when he thinks that the model assumptions are so far removed from reality that the abstraction leads to misleading conclusions. He has taken on prominent American macroeconomists, including previous Nobelists, criticising them bluntly, and if the prize were decided in the United States, he might still be without one. Again, I think both kinds of approaches to professional engagement have value. Thus, this year’s prize illustrates the spectrum of methods and styles encompassed in modern economics, which remains an important endeavour, if always with scope for improvement.
Returning to relevance and connections, it is easy to make the case that innovation will be critical for dealing with issues such as climate change. If the question is, how can several billion people be raised to living standards that match those in economically developed regions, the answer is not just the general one fleshed out by Romer, that innovation must be sustained. This innovation has to be guided in directions that will lead to environmentally sustainable increases in the standard of living: lower carbon emissions, less air and water pollution, preservation of biodiversity, and so on.
Even perfectly competitive markets do not lead to optimal outcomes when there are spillovers—negative ones of environmental damage, positive ones of knowledge accumulation. Things are worse when producers have market power, which can hinder innovation or accelerate environmental degradation. Countries like India do not have the luxury of following the path taken by Europe or the United States in their economic growth, or even the path followed by Japan and Korea. Economic policies have to respond to current realities.
Of course, economists like Nordhaus and Romer can only provide conceptual and technical advice. Politicians have to have incentives that translate these inputs into good policies. Some of those incentives come from the choices of the voters. But voters have to understand the issues at stake. A large number of American voters did not have a good grasp of the issues with respect to technological change and environmental damage when they supported Donald Trump for president, and he continues to obfuscate reality in those areas. Can Indian voters do better? It will be good if they can.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi warned about "war-mongering" by Indian journalists during the latest confrontation with Pakistan.
The Indian activist, who won the Nobel in 2014 with Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai, has organised a joint statement signed by 71 other laureates calling for nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to defuse tensions after skirmishes at their border.
Discussing the crisis, Satyarthi expressed relief that the worst confrontation between the countries since they went to war in 1999 had "calmed down", but he warned about the dangers of ultra-nationalism.
"Many people, not only ordinary people who are patriots and nationalists, but also the media suddenly crossed that line and started demanding fully fledged war," Satyarthi told AFP in an interview in Paris.
"Sometimes they enjoy these kind of situations. It is very unfortunate," he added.
"Luckily there are well-meaning people in journalism and politics who are working hard to de-escalate it, but there are a large number of people who crossed the line from patriotism to war-mongering."

Building up an investment case requires looking at a stock holistically. Today I’ve chosen to put the spotlight on Akzo Nobel N.V. (AMS:AKZA) due to its excellent fundamentals in more than one area. AKZA is a well-regarded dividend-paying company that has been able to sustain great financial health over the past. Below, I’ve touched on some key aspects you should know on a high level. For those interested in digging a bit deeper into my commentary, take a look at the report on Akzo Nobel here.
Excellent balance sheet average dividend payer
AKZA’s ability to maintain an adequate level of cash to meet upcoming liabilities is a good sign for its financial health. This implies that AKZA manages its cash and cost levels well, which is a key determinant of the company’s health. With a debt-to-equity ratio of 37%, AKZA’s debt level is acceptable. This indicates a good balance between taking advantage of low cost funding through debt financing, but having enough financial flexibility and headroom to grow debt in the future.
For those seeking income streams from their portfolio, AKZA is a robust dividend payer as well. Over the past decade, the company has consistently increased its dividend payout, reaching a yield of 2.8%.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 4, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and strategy professors Dan Lovallo and Olivier Sibony offer a breakthrough approach to complex decision-making in a significant new paper, "A Structured Approach to Strategic Decisions," published today by MIT Sloan Management Review.
Whatever else it produces, any organization is a decision factory. Yet, companies tend to approach their most complex decisions — including both one-off and recurrent strategic decisions — without discipline and rigor. As a result, high-stakes judgments are vulnerable to a slew of cognitive biases and random errors ("noise"), often leading to costly outcomes.
The antidote to this vulnerability is a structured, broadly applicable approach proven to reduce errors in decision-making. The authors introduce a method they call the Mediating Assessments Protocol (MAP), which injects discipline into decision-making, tempers the effects of bias and flawed thinking, and ultimately brings some much-needed quality assurance to complex decisions.
"Important facts are less likely to be overlooked, and thoughtful, self-critical consideration of trade-offs is much more likely to occur," the authors write. "In this way, using MAP triggers conscious reflection."
The article describes the core elements of MAP:
Define the mediating assessments in advance. Decision makers must identify a handful of key attributes that are critical to the evaluation, just as they would when writing a job description for an open position.
Decision makers must identify a handful of key attributes that are critical to the evaluation, just as they would when writing a job description for an open position. Use fact-based, independently made assessments. People who weigh in on one aspect of a strategic option should not be influenced by one another — or by other dimensions of the option. Their opinions should be grounded in the evidence available. This approach is comparable to a well-organized structured-interview process, in which job seekers are scored on each key attribute solely on the basis of their answers to relevant questions, calibrated using predefined scales.
People who weigh in on one aspect of a strategic option should not be influenced by one another — or by other dimensions of the option. Their opinions should be grounded in the evidence available. This approach is comparable to a well-organized structured-interview process, in which job seekers are scored on each key attribute solely on the basis of their answers to relevant questions, calibrated using predefined scales. Make the final evaluation when the mediating assessments are complete. Unless a "deal breaker" fact is uncovered early on, the final decision should be discussed only when all key attributes have been scored and a complete profile of assessments is available. This is similar to having a hiring committee review all the evaluations made by each interviewer on each key requirement of the job description before making a decision on a candidate.
Using this framework, the authors examine MAP's application and benefits in two types of strategy decisions: large one-off decisions made by teams of executives or directors (large acquisition), and recurrent decisions made as part of formalized processes that, in aggregate, shape a company's strategy (launching new products). They demonstrate how structure and mediating assessments can reduce bias, facilitate learning, provide standardization, and make it easier to conduct postmortems of past decisions.
"[MAP] is easy to learn, involves a minimal amount of additional work, and leaves senior executives some freedom to exercise intuitive judgment, albeit after a useful delay," conclude the authors. "As such, it should be a valuable tool for any leader who aims to raise the quality of an organization's decisions."

Where has carbon pricing been successful? Where has it failed?
We learned with the European Union that once you go beyond the simple, idealized version of carbon prices and into implementation, it’s a very different thing. One of the things we found out: One of the problems with cap and trade [a system in which governments place a cap on countries’ carbon-dioxide pollution and companies then pay for, and trade, credits that permit them to pollute] is that it is dependent on predicting what future emissions will be. But if those projections are wrong, the system fails.
With the E.U., their projected carbon emissions were high, but the actual carbon emissions were low, and the carbon price fell drastically, from $30 to $40 per ton down to single digits. So the price was so low it did not have an effect in lowering emissions. It was flawed design. If the models had predicted too few emissions, and the price had gone to $1,000 per ton. we would have had a different problem.
The carbon tax has different problems, but not this one. The price of carbon is independent of the amount of emissions.
When I talk to people about how to design a carbon price, I think the model is British Columbia. You raise electricity prices by $100 a year, but then the government gives back a dividend that lowers internet prices by $100 year. In real terms, you’re raising the price of carbon goods but lowering the prices of non-carbon-intensive goods.
That’s the model of how something like this might work. It would have the right economic effects but politically not be so toxic. The one in British Columbia is not only well designed but has been politically successful.
What went wrong when President Obama tried to implement a carbon price in 2009?
I did not talk to Obama about this directly, but I spoke with many of his advisers over the years.

When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Akzo Nobel India share price has climbed 59% in five years, easily topping the market return of 35% (ignoring dividends).
View our latest analysis for Akzo Nobel India
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During five years of share price growth, Akzo Nobel India achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.4% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 9.8% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.

Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..
What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Akzo Nobel India's TSR for the last 5 years was 85%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
A Different Perspective
Akzo Nobel India shareholders are down 6.1% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 2.9%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 13% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Before deciding if you like the current share price, check how Akzo Nobel India scores on these 3 valuation metrics.
Of course Akzo Nobel India may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.

Seeking fresh perspectives about research and innovation, as many as 44 next-generation Indian scientists have gathered here on the banks of the Lake Constance for extensive discussions with 39 Nobel Laureates from around the world and share their vision.
The select group is a part of the 580 young scientist contingent from 89 countries attending the 69th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting which officially opened on Sunday at this Bavarian Island.
The eminent speakers called on the next-generation of scientists to play an active role in shaping societal developments.
The meeting, being attending by 44 young Indian scientists associated with several research institutes in India and abroad, offers a lifetime opportunity to them to closely interact with Nobel Laureates from their discipline over seven days.
This year's meeting dedicated to physics, with laser physics being the core topic, in keeping with the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Other topics include dark matter and gravitational waves, which were first detected in 2016.
"Selection to this meeting was a dream come true for me as it is a lifetime opportunity to interact with the peers in my own research area and learn from all the Nobel Laureates," Megha Jain, who is pursuing PHD in material sciences from Patiala University in Punjab told PTI on the sidelines of the event.
"I knew about this meeting ever since I was in my masters, and have been trying to be in this august gathering for the past seven years and finally it feels great to be here," Aditi Toshniwal, who pursued her PHD from National Institute of Technology ( NIT) Surat in Gujarat, told PTI.
"Such meetings provide a boost to researchers like me by learning from the dedication of the Nobel Laureates to stay focused on your work and not to lose hope which is key to research," said Toshniwal.
Her research is mostly based on renewables such as perveskite solar cells.
Toshniwal and Jain noted that they are looking forward to interacting with Canadian scientist Donna Strickland, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2018 for generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses.
The host, Countess Bettina Bernadotte, President of the Council for the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, picked up on an appeal made by Nobel Laureate Elizabeth Blackburn in 2018 in Lindau, in which she urged scientist to adopt a global, sustainable and open approach.
"Share your vision with us and become involved!" she said.
She explained that the Lindau Meeting was conceived for exactly this purpose: as a forum for dialogue and exchange.
The meeting offers ample opportunity for the participating Nobel Laureates and young scientists to engage in extensive discussions.
A variety of programme formats will facilitate face-to-face dialogue, such as the Agora Talks, Laureate Lunches and Science Walks.
The German Federal Minister of Education and Research, Anja Karliczek emphasised the special nature of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings.
"They represent an international and globally unique forum at which scientists come together from every corner of the earth."

In his keynote address, Australian Nobel Laureate Brian Schmidt encouraged young scientists to play a greater role in tackling societal challenges.
"There's a multitude of problems out there," Schmidt said.
"We scientists are the ones who must confront them. Let's talk them out!"

The scientific programme got underway Monday, with a lecture from Strickland.
Last year, she became just the third woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.
Yemen's Tawakkol Karman, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011, will speak about her experiences as a human rights activist on the last day of the meeting on Friday on Mainau Island.
The host country of this year's Lindau Meeting, South Africa, presents itself as a research-focused nation.

There is "quite a good chance" of a global late this year or next year, Nobel Prize-winning economist has warned, citing a general lack of preparedness among economic policymakers.
Speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai, Krugman said it was unlikely that just "one big thing" would prompt an economic downturn.
He said a range of economic headwinds would increase the likelihood of a slowdown.
"I think that there is quite a good chance that we will have a late this year or next year," he said.
"The main concern has always been that we don't have an effective response if things slow down...We don't seem to have a safety net," the eminent academic said.
Noting that the central banks often lack the tools available to insulate against market turmoil, Krugman said the planning for risk has been minimal.
He said instead trade wars and growing protectionism continue to dominate policy agendas, deferring attention and resources from what should be the real priorities.
Drawing an analogy between the state of the global and the famous Titanic ship, Krugman said, "I don't see the iceberg out there, but if we do hit one, I know for sure this liner is not unsinkable".
Krugman said stagnant wages, growing inequalities and a loss of confidence in the world's business leaders have created a spirited populist backlash against globalisation.
"The result is clear: Forward motion on globalisation has stopped, but it was slowing anyway," he said.
Krugman said people feel they have been short-changed by the last generation of economic growth, and the consensus around the problem is not mirrored in discussions of the solution.
"The question is what they want as the solution...Turns out that's not as clear," Krugman said, pointing to the gap that leaders must fill in order to avert the next Great Depression.
Krugman also expressed skepticism about the promise of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
"Technological change is actually relatively sluggish right now," he said.
He warned against the calls of an impending "labour Armageddon" at the hands of increasing digitalisation.
"This is not a transformative revolutionary era," he said on Sunday, adding that despite the technological advancements in the last 25 years, the way people work has not changed all that much.
Krugman is a professor emeritus of Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. He won the Nobel Prize in 2008 for his work on economic geography and identifying trade patterns.

Nobel laureate Paul Romer was part of a panel discussion in Cape Town at the fourth annual meeting of New Development Bank (NDB). Picture: Supplied
CAPE TOWN – Nobel laureate Paul Romer on Monday described South Africa as an "economic disappointment", citing the high levels of unemployment among the country's youth, calling it a "human catastrophe". "It's a very hard story because there was this political miracle in this country which was then followed by economic disappointment and the thing I would point to is not so much the outsiders, but the under-utilisation of human talent in South Afria," Romer said.
He was part of a panel discussion in Cape Town at the fourth annual meeting of New Development Bank (NDB).
The NDB is a multilateral finance institution established by the BRICS bloc of countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
Romer told delegates South Africa should not wait for educational reform but should rather get more people into jobs. "To have such extraordinary high unemployment levels especially among young people ... this is just a catastrophe for the future of this country," he said.

When it comes to investing in a stock, saving for retirement or making daily financial decisions, people’s emotions, biases and lack of self-control often end up hurting their bottom line.
The not-so-rational money moves people make have spawned the increasingly popular field of “behavioral economics” — or the study of how psychology and economics intersect.
On Monday, this field burst into the public eye when Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago professor dubbed the “father of behavioral economics,” won the 2017 Nobel Prize for economics.
Thaler has written books like Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics; The Winner’s Curse: Paradoxes and Anomalies of Economic Life and Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness. He also made a cameo appearance in the 2015 movie The Big Short, which chronicled the mortgage meltdown that caused the 2008 financial crisis.
In a video on the University of Chicago’s website touting Misbehaving, Thaler explains how this book — which chronicles people’s financial misbehavior in things ranging from household finance to TV game shows — and his field of study differs from traditional economic theory.

It is “about the way actual people behave as opposed to the way economists think people behave – (like) people who are highly rational, unemotional creatures — kind of like Spock in the Star Trek TV series,” Thaler explained. “The people I study are humans that are closer to Homer Simpson."
"We humans don’t always choose the right thing," he continued. "Sometimes we overeat. Sometimes we exercise too little. Many of us have trouble saving enough for retirement.”
CLOSE The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to academic Richard H. Thaler, for his "contributions to behavioral economics." Time
Here are examples of financial miscalculations, based on theories Thaler has written about.
Hot-hand fallacy
A “classic error” people make, Thaler explained in The Big Short, is “thinking whatever is happening now is going to continue to happen in the future.”
“It is called the hot hand fallacy,” he said.
Examples: A gambler who has won many hands in a row at a blackjack table and thinks his run of luck will continue. Or a basketball player that has scored five straight three-point baskets and fires up another because he thinks he can’t miss. Or a stock investor back in 1999 who thought the dot-com-stock powered Nasdaq composite – which soared 85.6% that year – would keep going up forever. Or a real estate investor in 2007 who believed that then-soaring U.S. home prices could never go down.
Here’s the downside to the hot-hand fallacy: That tech stock investor whose $10,000 investment in the Nasdaq at the start of 1999 grew to $18,560 by year-end and who stayed invested — he got creamed. The Nasdaq fell 39.3% in 2000, whittling the $18,560 down to $11,266.
Similarly, a home flipper who jumped in at the top of the housing market in the first quarter of 2007, when the median sale price of a home was $257,400, saw the price of a home tumble more than 19% by the start of 2009. By then, the median home price hit $208,400, according to Federal Reserve data.
Endowment Effect
This mental miscue is when people place a greater value on things they own than things they don’t own. As a result, they often make the mistake of holding on to shares of an asset, such as a stock that is tumbling, because they are personally attached to it. They also convince themselves that it will bounce back in price.
An extreme case of endowment effect is the rise and fall of Enron stock at the start of the 2000s, says Woody Dorsey, who heads a behavioral finance firm Market Semiotics based in Castleton, VT. “A lot of people who worked there invested all their money in Enron even though you’re told not to overly invest in the company you work for,” says Dorsey.
Let’s say you were an employee at Enron when the natural gas trading company was on top of the world and its stock was trading at more than $90 a share in August 2000. A lot of employees held on to the stock, riding it down below $1 in November 2001 despite a wave of negative headlines that grew ominous in the summer of 2001. That's when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months on the job. The Enron news got worse that fall when snippets of a massive accounting and document shredding scandal were leaking out daily in the press. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2001.
Mental Accounting
Thaler’s research has challenged the notion that every dollar is the same in a person’s mind. His work shows that people do mental accounting in their heads. For example, they earmark money for specific uses or goals, such as food for the week, entertainment, paying the mortgage, or saving for retirement. As such, they make financial decisions based on how their spending will impact those small little accounts, not their overall financial picture. This strategy can help people from over-spending on certain things. If, for example, you have set a weekly budget of $25 for your morning coffee at Starbucks and by Wednesday have hit your limit after treating two friends one day, it may be easier for you to skip your daily coffee until the following week. That's because you have hit your maximum spending for this mental spending account.
But mental accounting also work against people, too, says Dorsey. Someone that has $10,000 sitting in the bank, for example, may feel rich and then go out and buy something on a credit card that runs his balance up to $10,000 as well. So, the person may not be as rich as he thinks he is, Dorsey says.

Story 160
The billionaire financier and convicted sex offender famously mixed with presidents, models and film stars. But he also indulged his unorthodox beliefs by cultivating top scientists
According to his indictment, over the course of many years Jeffrey Epstein “sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations”. It continues: “in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused.”
Some of his victims were reportedly as young as 14. Virginia Giuffre was one of those girls, claiming in newly unsealed documents that she was “recruited” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida by socialite, heiress, and Epstein’s alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000, when she was just 16. Giuffre now describes her time with Epstein as being forced to be a “sex slave”.

Shortly after her sworn deposition became public Epstein was found dead in his holding cell, apparently from suicide.
Epstein’s lifestyle has been well documented: he owned a private island in the US Virgin Islands and jetted around the world with rich and powerful men, including the Clintons, Trump, Woody Allen, Larry Bird and Prince Andrew.
He had been indicted in 2008, when he walked away with a “sweetheart deal” that gave him minimal jail time and shielded any possible co-conspirators.

One aspect of Epstein’s life of luxury seems incongruously out of place though. He surrounded himself with prominent scientists, Harvard professors, multiple Nobel Prize winners, authors, almost exclusively men – Epstein kept his social gatherings stocked with some of the world’s most eminent figures in this world.
He would host dinners at his Upper East side Manhattan apartment and invite a mix of leading scientists and people from the world of fashion and modeling. One scientist, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Slate that there was virtually no interaction between these two sets of guests . “Sometimes he’d turn to his left and ask some science-y questions. Then he’d turn to his right and ask the model to show him her portfolio.” Slate claimed that a young “female staffer” emerged in the middle of one of these dinners to give Epstein a neck massage while he talked.
When he gathered 21 physicists on his private island for a 2006 meeting about gravity, he reportedly had three to four young women in tow at all times. He also met many scientists at an annual gathering hosted by John Brockman, a literary agent who represented famous science authors such as Stephen Hawking and Jared Diamond. Nobel-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark and was represented by Brockman, thanked Epstein for his financial support in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 book, The Quark and the Jaguar.
A partial list of the biggest scientific names in Epstein’s orbit, according to the New York Times includes “the theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen Hawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and best-selling author; George M Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be altered to create superior humans; and the MIT theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate”.
Epstein called himself a “science philanthropist”, and donated handsomely to prestigious organizations such as Harvard, MIT, and the Santa Fe Institute. At one point, he was allegedly giving as much as $20m a year to fund scientists. Some institutions and researchers continued to take Epstein’s money even after his 2008 conviction, like MIT, according to BuzzFeed News.
Epstein called himself a 'science philanthropist' and donated handsomely to prestigious organizations
Joi Ito, the head of MIT’s world-famous Media Lab issued an apology last week for having accepted donations for the Media Lab and his own tech startups. In his open letter on the MIT Media Lab’s website, he said: “I take full responsibility for my error in judgment. I am deeply sorry to the survivors, to the Media Lab, and to the MIT community for bringing such a person into our network.
“Regrettably, over the years, the Lab has received money through some of the foundations that he controlled. I also allowed him to invest in several of my funds which invest in tech startup companies outside of MIT’s.”
Last month Jenna Marshall, a spokesperson for the Santa Fe Institute, said in the BuzzFeed News story that a $25,000 donation in 2010 from Epstein “prompted our leadership to decide not to accept any additional funds from Mr Epstein or related sources”. They were, she said, considering donating an equal amount to a charity working with victims of sex trafficking.
Several years after his 2008 conviction, publications including Forbes, the National Review, and HuffPo all ran stories on Epstein praising him as a selfless philanthropist, “a hedge-funder with a zealous science background”, and “one of the largest backers of cutting-edge science around the world”. None of the articles mentioned his criminal history, and an investigation by the New York Times claimed they were used as part of a public relations campaign to revamp Epstein’s image. All three publications have since deleted or amended articles cited by the New York Times.
By most accounts, he would engage with his guests at his science-related parties but never for very long or very deeply, often derailing conversations by abruptly changing topics or turning other people’s comments into jokes.
Still, some of the scientists seemed smitten. In a 2002 profile of Epstein for New York Magazine, Martin Nowak, now a professor of biology and mathematics and head of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, said that he once broke out a blackboard during dinner with Epstein and, for two hours, gave a mathematical description of how language works. “Jeffrey has the mind of a physicist. It’s like talking to a colleague in your field. Sometimes he applies what we talk about to his investments. Sometimes it’s for his own curiosity. He has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want,” Nowak said.
Jeffrey has the mind of a physicist. He has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want Martin Nowak
Lawrence Krauss, a physicist who retired from Arizona State University, even continued defending Epstein after his 2008 conviction, telling the Daily Beast in 2011: “As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I’ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people.” He added, “I don’t feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”
Other scientists seem to have been drawn to the attention and spotlight that Epstein gave them. Evolutionary biologist George Church, one of the few researchers who has apologized for having contact with Epstein, which he attributes to “nerd tunnel vision”, told STAT News that “he is used to financiers, technologists, and celebrities seeking him out, and has become a quasi-celebrity himself”.
Many of the scientists and researchers began distancing themselves from Epstein after 2008 and have publicly condemned him since his arrest in July. Scoene author Steven Pinker, who was flown to a TED Conference on Epstein’s private jet in 2002, including Daniel Dennetand John Brockman, has recently refuted any suggestions that he knew, or had any relationship with Epstein. In a response published on the @evolutionistrue website, Pinker said: “The annoying irony is that I could never stand the guy, never took research funding from him, and always tried to keep my distance. I think the dislike was mutual – according to a friend, he ‘voted me off the island’.”
“Given my longstanding distaste for everything Epstein, it’s galling to be publicly associated with him based on some photos and mutual associates.”
He explained the private jet to the TED conference, in a tweet last month:
Steven Pinker (@sapinker) I have no relationship with Epstein & have taken no funding from him. Our circles have occasionally overlapped: In 02, my lit agent invited me to join a group of east-coast TED speakers Epstein flew to CA. In 14, Krauss seated me next to him at a lunch, & someone snapped a photo.
Dennett has since said he had never heard of Epstein when he boarded the jet.
But while Epstein may not have been able to contribute much to the conversations he cultivated around him, he did have sincere interest in at least some scientific topics.
The New York Times did a deep dive into Epstein’s scientific beliefs in an article titled Jeffrey Epstein Hoped to Seed Human Race With His DNA. The Times’ reporters found that Epstein was apparently fixated on “transhumanism”, the belief that the human species can be deliberately advanced through technological breakthroughs, such as genetic engineering and artificial intelligence.
At its most benign, transhumanism is a belief that humanity’s problems can be improved, upgraded even, through such technology as cybernetics and artificial intelligence – at its most malignant though, transhumanism lines up uncomfortably well with eugenics.
Eugenics is the belief that humanity can be improved by controlled breeding, selecting for preferable traits and minimizing less desirable ones. Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus of law at Harvard and a former lawyer of Epstein’s, said in the New York Times investigation that Epstein would at times steer conversations about how to improve the human race genetically, an idea that appalled Dershowitz because of the overlap with Nazi theories about eugenics.
Epstein was allegedly fascinated with and inspired by the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was founded in Escondido, California, in 1980 by Robert K Graham, an avowed eugenicist and tycoon who got rich developing shatterproof eyeglass lenses. Graham’s goal was the “strengthening of the human gene pool”and he would accomplish this with the Repository, a sperm bank where all the donors were Nobel laureates. At least that’s how it was supposed to work: according to a 2001 story in Slate, Graham only ever convinced three or five (the stories vary) to actually contribute, and the Repository shuttered in 1999.
But Epstein was apparently taken with the idea. In his version though, rather than a bunch of lettered academics, he’d be the one “strengthening the gene pool”. Starting in the early 2000s, he reportedly told multiple people that he wanted to impregnate as many women as he could to distribute his genes as widely as possible. Several acquaintances told the New York Times that Epstein mentioned using his sprawling New Mexico ranch as a base of operations, and at least one person said he planned to impregnate up to 20 women at a time.
The puzzle at the heart of Epstein’s fandom is how it lasted for so long and why he managed to draw so many scientists into this circle. As Katha Pollit, writing in the Nation last week said: “What I can’t get over is how Epstein successfully weaseled his way into science at the highest level by cultivating major figures in the field socially and spreading his wealth around. Science! The very temple of the pursuit of truth. Call me insufficiently jaded, but am I wrong to expect more of those we rely on to combat all of the nonsense swirling around us?”

Story 161
The world economy is based on ever-increasing population, said Nobel laureate Steven Chu, a scheme that economists don't talk about and that governments won't face, a scheme that makes sustainability impossible and that is likely to eventually fail.
"The world needs a new model of how to generate a rising standard of living that’s not dependent on a pyramid scheme," Chu said at the University of Chicago.
Chu didn't specify what that new model would look like, but he offered a solution to the population growth the current one relies on.
"Increased economic prosperity and all economic models supported by governments and global competitors are based on having more young people, workers, than older people," Chu said. "Two schemes come to mind. One is the pyramid scheme. The other is the Ponzi scheme. I’m not going to explain them both to you, you can look it up. But it’s based on growth, in various forms."
For example, healthy young workers pay the health care costs for aging workers and retirees, the former energy secretary said, a scheme that requires increasing numbers of young workers. And economic growth requires more and more people to buy more and more stuff, with dire environmental consequences.
There are at least two problems with that:
"Depending on a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme, there’s no such thing as sustainability," Chu said. As standards of living increase, population growth declines. So if the economy succeeds in raising standards of living, it undermines itself.
"The economists know this, but they don’t really talk about it in the open, and there’s no real discussion in government," Chu said. "Every government says you have to have an increase in population, whether you do it through immigrants or the home population. So, this is a problem."
China has replaced its one-child policy with incentives for parents to have two children, Chu noted as an example, and France offers a prize, the Médaille de la Famille Française, to mothers of large families. Incentives like these will not help the world achieve sustainability, he said.
Chu, the man who solved the Gulf Oil spill with a doodle on a napkin, then offered two painless solutions to population growth:
"Education of women and wealth creation. Across all cultures. You go negative. You go negative birth.
"In many countries around the world, developed countries, Japan, Spain Italy, we’re talking about 1.3 (children per couple), 1.2 going below 1, where 2 is steady state."
So Chu expects these effects of rising living standards to eventually offset the growth of human population. That will help the environment, he said, but it will also require a new kind of economy.
Chu's visit to the University of Chicago was sponsored by the Energy Policy Institute of Chicago (for whom I sometimes host podcasts) and the Institute of Molecular Engineering.

The following story contains graphic details of an alleged sexual assault. It was last updated at 11:40 CST.
Óscar Arias, the former president of Costa Rica and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, was accused Monday of sexual assault in a criminal complaint, according to a report first published by the weekly Semanario Universidad.
The document, which was obtained by Semanario Universidad, states that the case has been initiated for the alleged crime of rape. The New York Times also obtained a copy of the complaint.
According to the reports, the alleged incident occurred in December 2014 at Arias’ house in Rohrmoser, San José. In the testimony, the victim said she had been invited to Arias’ house to deliver more information regarding an anti-nuclear armament campaign they had been discussing, per Semanario Universidad.
The accuser was identified as Alexandra Arce von Herold, nuclear disarmament activist, according to The New York Times. She recounted the assault as follows, as quoted in Semanario Universidad:
“He grabbed me from behind and touched my breasts. I told him ‘no,’ and that he was married. That was my no. It was the only thing I could think to tell him. I had met his wife. It was the only thing that occurred to me because I am an idiot, but I did not know what to do, really, and I thought that this was the only line of defense I could have. And when he did not react to that, I did not know what to say, because I had this fear that if I refused, he would not cooperate with us anymore. I do not remember what he said, but he kept touching me, he put his fingers in my vagina and he touched me and he kissed me. And then he told me to wait for a moment and he left the office. I felt as if I did not know what to do; I felt trapped in that moment. “
Arias initially declined comment to Semanario Universidad through his lawyer, Rodolfo Brenes Vargas. He issued the following statement Tuesday morning via his lawyer, according to journalist Amelia Rueda:
“I categorically reject the accusations that are made of me. I have never acted in a manner disrespecting the will of any woman, much less in the case of her freedom to relate to another person. ”
Semanario Universidad reports that Dr. Arce told several people about the alleged assault, including her boyfriend on the day of the incident. The weekly says she also told a former Costa Rican congresswoman, Natalia Díaz Quintana, who recommended the victim speak with her family and prepare to take “corresponding actions.”
The victim then told colleagues at an anti-nuclear armament conference held in Austria later in December 2014 in addition to multiple relatives and friends, according to the Semanario Universidad report.
Monday, Dr. Arce took her case to the criminal court and filed a complaint with the Gender Prosecutor’s Office, according to both reports. The victim said she was motivated to come forward after seeing gymnasts testify against United States Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar, according to The New York Times.
Semanario Universidad has a copy of the criminal complaint, in which the victim states she has no interest in presenting any claim for financial compensation. Both publications also conducted interviews with people who could corroborate the victim’s story.

There’s a one-in-seven chance that stock market momentum will fail over any given 10-year period. That’s important to bear in mind since momentum is coming off one of those 10-year periods. Its failure has led to no end of soul-searching among advisers and researchers alike, wondering whether the venerable momentum effect may have stopped working permanently.
Their fretting was likely little more than wasted energy. Even if momentum is just as effective a strategy in the future as the past, the volatility of its returns is such that there is a not-insignificant chance that it will still lose money over any given 10-year period.
That is the conclusion I reached upon analyzing momentum’s performance since 1927 in the U.S. stock market, courtesy of the database maintained by University of Chicago finance professor (and Nobel laureate) Eugene Fama and Dartmouth finance professor Ken French. To measure the likelihood of momentum losing money over a given decade, I conducted 100,000 simulations in each of which I picked 120 months at random from the more than 1,100 actual months between 1927 and 2018.
Read: Why Two Stock ‘Factors’ May Be Better Than One
These simulations produced a 10-year loss 13.1% of the time. To be sure, this finding doesn’t rule out the possibility that the momentum effect has become less pronounced in recent years, or even that it may have disappeared altogether. But the simplest and most straightforward assumption we should make when some long-standing pattern stops working is that it’s caused by nothing more than random fluctuations of the data — bad luck, in other words.
In reaching this conclusion, I closely followed the research design laid out by Fama and French in an article they wrote for the third-quarter of 2018’s issue of the Financial Analysts Journal. In this article, they reported on similar simulations for the small-cap effect (small-cap stocks outperforming large-caps) and the value effect (value beats growth). The frequency of negative 10-year returns that they found was similar to what I found for momentum.
Newsletter Sign-up
The takeaway here is that it’s difficult for any of us to accept that we may lose money over a decade for no other reason than mere bad luck. Our psyches demand an explanation, since it requires too much cognitive dissonance to accept that so much pain could be caused by randomness. So we are led inexorably to come up with after-the-fact explanations for what happened.
We need to resist that impulse. The first possibility we should always entertain is that failure was caused by bad luck. Only when that possibility is ruled out should we begin to explore other possible explanations.
Consider the track record of a momentum-based advisory service that I monitor, NoLoad Fund X, whose editor is Janet Brown. The service constructs several different model portfolios of mutual funds based on their momentum, and over the long term these portfolios have performed well on average. But over the last decade they have lagged the market. (See accompanying chart.)
Since mid-1980, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest, the service’s average model portfolio has beaten the Wilshire 5000 index by an annualized margin of 11.8% to 11.0%. Over the past decade, in contrast, the service’s average model portfolio has lagged by a margin of 9.9% to 13.0%. (To put these results another way, the newsletter over the 28 years prior to the last decade beat a buy-and-hold by 2.1 annualized percentage points.)
Lagging the market by an annualized 3.1 percentage points over a decade is well within the range of what emerged from my simulations. So the simplest and most straightforward explanation is that the newsletter is coming off a rare, but not unprecedented, period of bad luck.
Accordingly, after such a poor stretch, NoLoad Fund X can be expected to soon start outperforming the broad market. This may have already begun, in fact. In 2018, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest, the newsletter beat the Wilshire 5000 index by 1.9 percentage points.

Getty Images Nobel prize-winning US economist Joseph Stiglitz
The U.S. needs multiple layers of regulation of the finance industry because the damage from malfunction is so much higher than the costs, a Nobel economics laureate said Monday.
Joseph Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University, who was the Nobel laureate in economics in 2001, spoke at a talk on Monday with Damon Silvers, the director of policy and special counsel at the AFL-CIO, part of a day-long strategy session on “Bargaining for the Common Good in the World of Global Finance” held by the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung office in New York, a non-profit political German foundation.
Regulations “from below” could be beneficial while a comprehensive regulatory vision has to be “from the top,” Stiglitz added.
A “whistleblower statute” could be a good way to balance the need of internal reporting against banks’ legal violations and the need to protect the employees from retaliation, Stiglitz said. Also, he added, strengthening the union is an important approach to empower workers.
Related: Whistleblower earns $30 million, but does money really make tipsters come forward?
From a higher-level perspective, Stiglitz said, the union plays an important role in working with “good management” to foster a “right culture,” because “workers want to feel that they’re doing something positive for society.”
The discussion came amidst recent achievements of union-backed campaigns represented by the Committee for Better Banks, a Communications Workers of America-affiliated community and labor coalition, which was created in 2013 on a mission to “ensure fair banking practices” in the post-financial crisis era.
The CBB just claimed a victory as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and the City Council recently passed a policy that requires any bank that bids for the city’s contracts to disclose its sales goals and other potentially predatory business practices, which shuts the gate for the banks that force their workers to meet predatory sales goals by pushing new accounts, loans, credit cards and debt cards.
The ordinance was passed in response to the Wells Fargo WFC, -0.27% phony-accounts scandal, in which 3.5 million fake accounts were created by workers of the San Francisco-based bank to meet the aggressive sales goals.
Despite the progress, more than half of frontline bank workers surveyed by the National Employment Law Project, another union-backed group, and the CBB, say they still depend on bonuses or incentive pay, and 90% of workers report facing consequences including bullying, retaliation, or possible termination if they fail to meet these metrics. The report, which was released in June, was based on a survey of 400 current and former workers employed by some of the largest national banks in the country, including Wells Fargo, US Bank USB, -0.38% , and Bank of BAC, -1.40%
“It’s very difficult to regulate banks,” Stiglitz said, adding that despite the difficulties, regulations should achieve at least three goals. One is to ensure that the banks don’t “abuse ordinary citizens,” as the banks usually do by market manipulations; the second is to restrict the banks’ access to risk-taking, especially keeping them away from the extent of adventure that led to the financial crisis; the third one is to let the banks “serve the society,” which Stiglitz said is the most important one as the first two are limited at “stopping harms.”
“The hard part is the politics because it has become so wealthy that it has lot of money to spend in the lobbying and political campaigns in order to maintain their money,” Stiglitz said, comparing this with the “same dangerous moment” at the 19th century where the country “was all going to be controlled by a few big monopolies.”
“This is worrisome and we have to break it up now,” he said.
Speaking of the role that new technologies play in building up public voices for workers in the finance industry, Stiglitz said they are a “two-edged sword.”
On the one hand, technologies could bring people together and increase their awareness of some critical issues in the industry; while on the other hand, they could potentially facilitate “indentured servitude,” which means they could provide more efficient tools to spread information to enhance “exploitation” and “capitalization,” Stiglitz said.

The winner of this year’s Nobel prize in economics, Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago, is a controversial choice. Thaler is known for his lifelong pursuit of behavioural economics (and its subfield, behavioural finance), which is the study of economics (and finance) from a psychological perspective. For some in the profession, the idea that psychological research should even be part of economics has generated hostility for years.
Not from me. I find it wonderful that the Nobel Foundation chose Thaler. The economics Nobel has already been awarded to a number of people who can be classified as behavioural economists, including George Akerlof, Robert Fogel, Daniel Kahneman, Elinor Ostrom, and me. With the addition of Thaler, we now account for approximately 6% of all Nobel economics prizes ever awarded.
But many in economics and finance still believe that the best way to describe human behaviour is to eschew psychology and instead model human behaviour as mathematical optimisation by separate and relentlessly selfish individuals, subject to budget constraints. Of course, not all economists, or even a majority, are wedded to this view, as evidenced by the fact that both Thaler and I have been elected president, in successive years, of the American Economic Association, the main professional body for economists in the United States. But many of our colleagues unquestionably are.

I first met Thaler in 1982, when he was a professor at Cornell University. I was visiting Cornell briefly, and he and I took a long walk across the campus together, discovering along the way that we had similar ideas and research goals. For 25 years, starting in 1991, he and I co-organized a series of academic conferences on behavioural economics, under the auspices of the US National Bureau of Economic Research.
Over all those years, however, there has been antagonism – and even what appeared to be real animus – toward our research agenda. Thaler once told me that Merton Miller, who won the economics Nobel in 1990 (he died in 2000), would not even make eye contact when passing him in the hallway at the University of Chicago.
Miller explained his reasoning (if not his behaviour) in a widely cited 1986 article called “Behavioral Rationality in Finance.” Miller conceded that sometimes people are victims of psychology, but he insisted that stories about such mistakes are “almost totally irrelevant” to finance. The concluding sentence of his review is widely quoted by his admirers: “That we abstract from all these stories in building our models is not because the stories are uninteresting but because they may be too interesting and thereby distract us from the pervasive market forces that should be our principal concern.”

Stephen Ross of MIT, another finance theorist who was a likely future Nobel laureate until he died unexpectedly in March, argued along similar lines. In his 2005 book Neoclassical Finance, he, too, eschewed psychology, preferring to build a “methodology of finance as the implication of the absence of arbitrage”. In other words, we can learn a lot about people’s behaviour just from the observation that there are no $10 bills lying around on public sidewalks. However psychologically bent some people are, one can bet that they will pick up the money as soon as they spot it.
Both Miller and Ross made wonderful contributions to financial theory. But their results are not the only descriptions of economic and financial forces that should interest us, and Thaler has been a major contributor to a behavioural research programme that has demonstrated this.
For example, in 1981, Thaler and Santa Clara University’s Hersh Shefrin advanced an “economic theory of self-control” that describes economic phenomena in terms of people’s inability to control their impulses. Sure, people have no trouble motivating themselves to pick up a $10 bill that they might find on a sidewalk. There is no self-control issue there. But they will have trouble resisting the impulse to spend it. As a result, most people save too little for their retirement years.
Economists need to know about such mistakes that people repeatedly make. During a long subsequent career, involving work with UCLA’s Shlomo Benartzi and others, Thaler has proposed mechanisms that will, as he and Harvard Law School’s Cass Sunstein put it in their book Nudge, change the “choice architecture” of these decisions. The same people, with the same self-control problems, could be enabled to make better decisions.
Improving people’s saving behaviour is not a small or insignificant matter. To some extent, it is a matter of life or death, and, more pervasively, it determines whether we achieve fulfilment and satisfaction in life.
Thaler has shown in his research how to focus economic inquiry more decisively on real and important problems. His research programme has been both compassionate and grounded, and he has established a research trajectory for young scholars and social engineers that marks the beginning of a real and enduring scientific revolution. I couldn’t be more pleased for him – or for the profession.

When it comes to leaders, individuals are most drawn to those who exude optimism and confidence.
But some of the most desired traits of visionaries are also those that are most likely to lead to failure, according to Daniel Kahneman, co-recipient of the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics and professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University.
“Optimists have something going for them … they’re more likely to persist,” Kahneman said at the World Business Forum in New York City on Wednesday. “There are many things for which optimism is very good, but it has a cost.”
And that cost, Kahneman said, is excessive risk-taking.
“When lots of people are trying to pursue opportunities against the odds, it’s not very good for most of them, most of them will fail,” Kahneman added. “But it’s very good for society and for the economy, that is to have a lot of people competing and a few of them succeeding and most of them failing. That’s the way capitalism works.”
He cited inventors as a prime example: On average, inventors’ incomes would be higher if they took jobs working for others rather than chasing their ventures, Kahneman said. Those entrepreneurs of the world that do defy the odds – think Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk – are the exception, not the rule. And yet they become the ones to create the net value of society through job creation, innovation and investment returns.
“And that’s the paradox,” Kahneman said. “It’s not very good for the individual to be optimistic on average … but it gives a chance to extreme success, and extreme success is impossible without optimism and overconfidence and some exaggerated persistence.”
‘The most costly mistake of investors’
Kahneman, widely known for penning the magnum opus “Thinking Fast and Slow,” is a longtime skeptic of both optimism and overconfidence when it comes to decision-making. These qualities can lead individuals to put undue trust in their intuitions – the snap decisions that are informed by emotions and beliefs rather than by systematic evaluation.
“Having been successful is not a guarantee of future success. But it’s almost always a guarantee of future overconfidence,” Kahneman told Yahoo Finance.

The conditions under which a person can trust intuition are “very specific” and must involve practice, immediate feedback and “some regularity in the world that you can pick up and know,” Kahneman said.
“Stocks in the stock market do not have it,” he added. “The stock market is not sufficiently regular to support developing that kind of expert intuition.”
And when it comes to equity markets, investors tend to lose the most money by reacting to events, and especially to bad events, Kahneman said.
“The most costly mistake of investors undoubtedly is to churn too much,” Kahneman said. “The way I do things is I don’t look … the assumption should be that you shouldn’t change anything.”
Noise
Much of Kahneman’s writing has worked to define and evaluate the dichotomy between two categories of thought: “System 1,” an instinctive, emotion-driven fast mode of thinking, and “System 2,” or a logical, algorithmic and slower thought process.
Central to his work has been the belief that individuals place too much confidence in their judgement, without considering empirical facts of statistics and probabilities. His latest work, Kahneman told the World Business Forum audience, is on what he calls “noise,” or discrepancies in judgement among individuals that even they are not aware exist.
In a recent study, Kahneman gave a number of insurance company underwriters a case and asked them to assign a dollar value to each case and then checked to see by what percentage these values differed.
When Kahneman asked executives in the insurance company by what percentage they thought the underwriters’ values differed, the average answer was 10% – a small discrepancy. But the true answer, Kahneman said, was 50%. The results were the same when he tested claims adjusters.

India needs healthy and educated people to drive the economic growth for which the government needs to work on building opportunities for and capabilities of people, said Nobel Laureate and economist Amartya Sen.
Since the Ayushman Bharat Scheme neglects primary healthcare, it thus aims at wrong population, Amartya Sen said in an event. He instead recommends the government to boost immunity and health of infants and children through better dietary supplements at the primary healthcare level.
The scheme would help the people of India to get specialised care but only if they survive early dangers of life, he pointed out. “What India needed was a radical change of primary healthcare, what you have in the government is great belief in magic,” Amartya Sen said speaking at a launch of a book ‘A Quantum Leap in the Wrong Direction ?’

The book discusses outcomes achieved by the Modi government over five years. It concludes that the GDP growth rate of the NDA-II government is well below that achieved during UPA-I and only marginally better than UPA-II. Amartya Sen further raises serious reservations about the new methodology of measuring GDP, stressed banking sector and the outcomes of the demonetisation policy.
Meanwhile, Sourindra Ghosh and Imrana Qadeer, also recently pointed out the insufficiency of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in addressing the ailing public sector health in India. The increase in allocation to health sector in Budget 2019 should have been directed towards reviving primary health care, rather than at Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which does not cover a majority of the treatments, Sourindra Ghosh (PhD scholar at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, JNU) and Imrana Qadeer (Distinguished Faculty at Council for Social Development, Delhi) wrote in The Indian Express earlier this month.

Story 172
Akzo Nobel India Limited (NSE:AKZOINDIA) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. Investors can purchase shares before the 31st of July in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 22nd of August.
Akzo Nobel India’s next dividend payment will be ₹24.00 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of ₹24.00 per share. Based on the last year’s worth of payments, Akzo Nobel India stock has a trailing yield of around 1.4% on the current share price of ₹1726.35. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it’s also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn’t going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Akzo Nobel India can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
See our latest analysis for Akzo Nobel India
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Akzo Nobel India paid out 52% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 103% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings – expenses don’t pay themselves – so it’s not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.
While Akzo Nobel India’s dividends were covered by the company’s reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it’s not great to see that the company didn’t generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Akzo Nobel India’s ability to maintain its dividend.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it’s a relief to see Akzo Nobel India earnings per share are up 7.4% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a steady rate, but we’re concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company’s cash flow over the past year.
The main way most investors will assess a company’s dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Akzo Nobel India has delivered 4.1% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We’re glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.
The Bottom Line
From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Akzo Nobel India? Akzo Nobel India is paying out a reasonable percentage of its income and an uncomfortably high 103% of its cash flow as dividends. At least earnings per share have been growing steadily. It’s not that we think Akzo Nobel India is a bad company, but these characteristics don’t generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.
