            "content": "The volatile political situation in Venezuela has fueled a socioeconomic crisis. More than four million Venezuelans have left the country. Hyperinflation, which was a stunning 200,000 percent in 2019, is projected to reach 500,000 percent in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund. As Venezuelans cross borders, finding employment, health care and education for their children becomes a burden for their host countries. And in many cases the influx creates competition for jobs, worsening the quality of life for existing residents as well as for the immigrants.\n\nThese challenges are most concentrated in neighboring Colombia. Last year alone more than 1.3 million Venezuelans migrated there, mainly through the crossing in Cúcuta. Both countries share a complex border that is 2,219 kilometers (1,379 miles) long—about two thirds as long as the U.S.-Mexico border. Lengthy sections are largely unprotected. Colombia has exhibited outstanding generosity in welcoming refugees, but such sudden, large-scale changes are stressing resources and social services considerably.\n\nMany people who arrive in Colombia settle near the border and in northern cities, but jobs in those places are limited, water can be scarce and food is hard to grow in certain border regions. The corridor is rich in one resource, however: renewable energy. Wind is strong and sun is plentiful. A bold plan to expand and integrate these resources could bring energy, water and food security along the border and in other locations in northern Colombia. And the project would create many jobs—what is needed most.\n\nThe southern section of the border is warm and humid but difficult to develop because of jungle and land reservations for native people. The northernmost section (La Guajira) is very dry. In between them is El Cesar, which has some rugged mountains. It also has a hydroelectric dam, but it is far from border municipalities and the cost to transport water there is high.\n\nDeveloping renewable energy would generate jobs for residents and migrants, who would build roads and basic infrastructure as well as the electricity and water systems. Energy produced would boost agriculture by providing power to run desalination plants that would be built near the La Guajira border by the Caribbean Sea, which in turn would pump fresh water to farms. Irrigation would greatly expand precision agriculture, which would provide the greatest increase in long-term jobs and, of course, would help feed people. Much of the border zone does have good soil for farming. And abundant, clean water would improve health conditions for children.\n\nThe energy would also supplement power production from hydroelectric plants, which are vulnerable to recurring droughts and other climate events such as El Niño. Other renewable energy sources in the region—biomass and geothermal—could backstop any intermittency of wind and solar.\n\nAs renewable energy resources are developed, partnerships between public and private sectors could arise to create research institutes along the border that provide training, entrepreneurship, testing and validation of new technologies. Partnerships could also create K-12 innovation schools that focus on STEM. Innovation hubs and technology parks could follow. Zero-tax incentives, such as the one announced by Colombian President Iván Duque for the La Guajira region, could accelerate local and international investments.\n\nRenewable energy development could advance opportunities for Colombians and for Venezuelan immigrants by creating a vital and thriving border zone. Without such jobs for families or education for the younger generation, the possibility that guerillas in the region will attract many new recruits rises. This dangerous path, on top of the existing sociopolitical crisis, could destabilize the region. That in turn could pose a security threat for North America.\n\nDoing nothing, now, will only complicate the situation along the Venezuela-Columbia border in the near future. Realizing the vision of an energy-water corridor is in the best interest of countries across the Americas. And creating livelihoods for the people in the two neighboring nations is the right thing to do."

[+] 'Joker' onstage during the 92nd Annual Academy Awards at Dolby Theatre on February 09, 2020 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nThis award season, in addition to a string of wins, actor Joaquin Phoenix was able to convince the Golden Globes, the Critic’s Choice Awards, the SAG awards, and the Oscars to switch to an all-vegan menu. Sheila Morovati, President and Founder of two non-profit organizations, Crayon Collection and Habits of Waste, saw these victories as an ideal platform for Phoenix to deliver this important message. “The celebrity example can be a very powerful catalyst for propelling movements forward, especially when that example is a genuine person who cares about the cause as much as Phoenix does,” she told me. Phoenix has been an animal rights and climate change activist for years. Just last month, he was arrested along with Jane Fonda at her weekly climate protest.\n\nMorovati’s non-profit Habits of Waste, focuses on finding solutions to shift people’s often-unconscious wasteful habits, such as banning plastic straws, utensils and stirrers and her #CutOutCutlery campaign that convinced UberEats and Postmates to change their app’s default setting for plastic cutlery to by request only.\n\nShe believes that high profile opportunities like the Oscars telecast, which is seen by roughly 30 million people in the United States alone, and tens of millions more around the world, are needed to “help raise awareness for animal rights as well as the environment.” The all-vegan menu sends the message to millions of people that animal agriculture is a major contributor to climate change due to deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity, and water pollution. Morovati also wants people to know that “serving a delicious all-vegan menu isn’t that hard.”\n\nMorovati sees Phoenix as an example of what real commitment to combatting climate change can do on one of the world’s biggest stages. “He made it cool to serve vegan-only entrees to your guests and he also made it cool to make environmental activism part of your professional life.”\n\nShe hopes to see tastemakers and entertainers all over the world start preparing plant based only food for events from friendly neighborhood get-togethers to corporate luncheons and more. As someone who spends her time helping people shift their habits, Morovati hopes this trend “inspires everyone to eat more vegan meals and starts a ripple effect of positive change.”"

Due to continuous bad weather conditions in December and January in this rabi crop sowing season, PRCS was not getting the exact picture of area sown through Happy Seeders.\n\nDespite increasing the number of Happy Seeders from 9,000 last year to 16,000 this year, a fall of around 48,000 acres area under wheat cultivation using these machines has been recorded, according to satellite data analysed and released by Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC). The data shows a fall in acreage in 12 out of 22 districts of the state.\n\nDue to continuous bad weather conditions in December and January in this rabi crop sowing season, PRCS was not getting the exact picture of area sown through Happy Seeders.\n\nThe data sourced from the PRSC, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, revealed that this year Happy Seeder sown wheat area was 5.30 lakh hectares (13.09 lakh acres) out of the total wheat area of 35.05 lakh hectares (86.82 lakh acres) in Punjab.\n\nLast year, the area under Happy Seeder sowing was 5,49,370 (13.57 lakh acres), out of the total 34.90 lakh hectares (86.20 lakh acres).\n\nData showed that out of 22 districts of Punjab, 12 districts have shown a downward trend of sowing with Happy Seeders this year, while 10 districts have shown marginal to fair increase in the the sowing area.\n\nThe districts which have recorded a downward trend include Amritsar, where 31,240 hectares, which is 16.6 per cent of total 1,88,000 hectares wheat area, was sown with Happy Seeder against against 38,620 hectares last year. Amritsar saw a decrease of 7,380 hectares under Happy Seeder sowing area. In Bathinda, 31,150 hectares, which is 12.2 per cent of the total 2,54,000 hectares of wheat area, was sown against 43,000 hectares last year. Bathinda saw a decrease of 9,000 hectares (22,230 acres). Kapurthala district recorded 20,630 hectares, which is 22 per cent of total 1,09,000 hectares wheat area, against 28,040 hectares last year and saw a decrease of 26.5 per cent area under Happy Seeder with a fall of around 7410 hectares (18,302 acres).\n\nSBS Nagar recorded 17,520 hectares under Happy Seeder sowing which is 23 per cent of the total 76,000 hectares of wheat area and around 2,000 hectares less than the last year.\n\nIn Mansa, 33,520 hectares, which 19.7 per cent of total 1,70,000 hectares of wheat area, was recorded against 36,940 hectares last year that comes out to a decrease of 3, 420 hectares (8,447 acres). Pathankot, which saw minimum stubble burning area (4630 hectares) in state, also witnessed a decrease of 3,000 hectares (7400 acres) under Happy Seeder sowing this year. Apart from this Rupnagar, Gurdaspur, Mukatsar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Ferozepur districts have also recorded a downward trend.\n\nThe districts which have shown a fair increase in the area have Patiala on the top with an increase of around 6,000 hectares (14,820 acres), Tarn Taran, which saw an increase of 3000 hectares, Barnala, which saw an increase of 2870 hectares. Faridkot recorded an increase of around 2,550 hectares, Fatehgarh Sahib saw an increase of 2,200 hectares. Apart from these, Hoshiarpur, Mohali, Fazilka, Moga and Sangrur also saw an increase. In Sangrur, 54,410 hectares, which is 18.7 per cent of the total 2,90,000 hectares of wheat area, recorded against 52,500 hectares of last year.\n\n“The acreage recorded through satellite shows the exact picture because the details collected from the district agriculture offices were not as correct and it was calculated at 4.50 lakh hectares with Happy Seeder sowing,” said a senior officer in the Agriculture department.\n\n“We could calculate this data quite late this year because of the cloudy weather coupled with rains in December and January months due to which area could be recorded time to time and then it was calculated recently,” said Dr Anil Sood, head of the ACM Division, PRSC, Ludhiana a senior officer in the PRCS centre.\n\nGeneral secretary of BKU Dakaunda, Jagmohan Singh, said Happy Seeder had not given good results to several farmers last year and so they opted for the traditional method of sowing this year. He said the government should give compensation to farmers to manage stubble instead of bringing in huge machinery.\n\nHappy Seeder machine is the most publicised among machines which sow wheat directly after paddy harvesting without burning stubble.\n\n“Farmers have preferred other methods of direct wheat sowing rather than Happy Seeder this time,” said senior officer in the Agriculture Department.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

He said that the current format of the scheme requires active participation of three different sectors -- the State Governments, the Banking sector and the Insurance sector. Therefore, he said, there is a need to ensure effective consultation amongst all the stakeholders for the smooth implementation of the scheme that benefits farmers.\n\nDr. Abhilaksh Likhi, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, said that the main objectives of this conference are to understand the direction that the scheme is foraying into and individual roles thereof and to cross-learn from other institutions to resolve all the issues.\n\nDr Ashish Kumar Bhutani, CEO, PMFBY, and Joint Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, presented an overview of PMFBY implementation along with its milestones, achievements, and way forward. He said that there’s a need to make a joint effort by all the stakeholders to formulate communication strategy to build trust among farmers. Insurance companies need to address grievances raised by the farmers on social media within a stipulated timeframe. He said that there is a need to prioritise specific issues of the North-Eastern States about this scheme.\n\nAmong others present at the inaugural ceremony of the conference included Shri Malay Kumar Poddar, CMD, Agricultural Insurance Company of India Limited, Dr Om Prakash, Commissioner, Agriculture, Government of Rajasthan and Ms. Priya Kumar, Head Agri Business, HDFC ERGO Ltd.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare had previously organised first three editions of the National Conference in Lucknow, Bangalore, and Guwahati respectively.\n\n*****\n\nAPS/PK"

            "content": "Few commodities can shape global affairs – from geopolitics and trade wars to popular protests - the way food can.\n\nWhen I became director of the EU-funded Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) in 2010, the recent global crisis in food prices had sparked renewed focus on agriculture worldwide.\n\nSince then, the institute and its partners have demonstrated how agricultural innovations can be shared and scaled up to improve food security and livelihoods across Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.\n\nYet, as CTA enters the final year of its mandate, food systems and agriculture are once again under the spotlight as the climate emergency becomes increasingly urgent. At the same time, we begin the 10-year countdown to the delivery of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which also include zero hunger and zero poverty.\n\nInvesting in agriculture and agricultural innovation is therefore more important now than ever before if we are to have any hope of addressing the climate crisis, while also guaranteeing food security for the 820 million people still going hungry.\n\nInvesting in agriculture and agricultural innovation is more important now than ever before if we are to have any hope of addressing the climate crisis, while also guaranteeing food security for the 820 million people still going hungry. Michael Hailu Director of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA)\n\nIn particular, there is enormous potential to harness digitalisation and new technologies to make agriculture more efficient while increasing productivity and profitability. CTA research has shown for the first time an untapped market of more than $2 billion (€1.8 billion) to develop and provide more and better digital tools for farmers.\n\nAnd many of CTA’s projects and partners over the past 35 years provide a solid basis from which to expand and scale up, with additional support between now and 2030. CTA has also directly contributed to the EU’s Digital for Development policy, in particular relating to sustainable agriculture and entrepreneurship, and we hope that CTA’s work will serve as a basis for the EU’s continued focus in this sector.\n\nElsewhere, the pioneering Eyes in the Sky, Smart Techs on the Ground project has helped capitalise on the new opportunities for African farmers from drone-based systems. After training drone operators in responsible data gathering at start-ups across 11 African countries, pilots have provided farmers with more accurate information about their land, crops and livestock, allowing them to make informed decisions about fertilizer use, disease threat and weather events.\n\nMoreover, as an exciting, novel technology, drones have also helped to attract young entrepreneurs into agriculture. By the end of 2019, 38 youth-led businesses were offering drone services to farmers, and the first continental network of digital entrepreneurs, Africa Goes Digital, was established.\n\nAnother ground-breaking digital solution is cutting-edge insurance for livestock, which uses satellite imagery to detect whenever a lack of rainfall causes forage levels to fall too low to sustain herds. The pay-outs then allow farmers to buy in feed or move their herds before animals are lost to malnutrition during prolonged droughts, which are becoming more intense in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nMore than 10,000 pastoralists in Kenya are now covered by this insurance, which has also been rolled out in Ethiopia. But there is enormous potential to refine this service and expand this further across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe seeds have been sown for viable and effective solutions. With continued nurture, we will reap the rewards. Michael Hailu Director of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA)\n\nFinally, pilot projects throughout the Caribbean have explored the possible applications of blockchain in agriculture. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, Bioversity International and AgUnity have developed and tested blockchain to trace the quality of cocoa, helping farmers to secure a premium on their products.\n\nOther projects are investigating the use of blockchain to help farmers secure access to financial services. Verifiable financial information on a digital ledger, for example, could support farmers’ applications for credit and help “de-risk” them in the eyes of banks and other lenders.\n\nI have been thrilled to see some of these initiatives rolled out under my watch but I am yet more excited to see how others take them further, customising and developing the tools to properly serve specific needs of communities and regions.\n\nImproving agriculture in developing countries, through the best use of the latest available technology, has the potential to achieve so many of our global goals. The seeds have been sown for viable and effective solutions. With continued nurture, we will reap the rewards.\n\n____________\n\nAre you a recognised expert in your field?

            "content": "The peak power demand on the system crossed the 12,000 MW barrier in Telangana for the first time on Monday morning as the consumption of energy by the agriculture and irrigation sectors zoomed as part of the ongoing rabi cultivation operations.\n\nAccording to the energy officials, the previous highest demand on the system was eclipsed on Sunday when the demand clocked 11,783 MW against 11,703 MW recorded on August 30 last year (2019). However, in terms of energy consumption in a day, August 30, 2019 remains at the top as the consumption was recorded at 241.68 million units (MU) against 235.56 MU clocked on Sunday.\n\n“The intra-day peak demand touched about 12,060 MW on Monday at 10.15 a.m. with major spike in demand from the agriculture (pump sets) and irrigation (lifts) sectors. We expect the peak demand of power move towards 13,000 MW mark and energy consumption towards 250 MU mark this season,” a senior executive of TS-Transco said adding that they were prepared to meet the demand.\n\nThe official attributed the increased demand of energy to cultivation of paddy in a huge extent of over 10.81 lakh hectares, the highest ever, during the rabi season in the State as also the consumption from lift irrigation projects such as Kaleshwaram and Kalwakurthy. Cultivation of rabi crops with groundwater such as maize and groundnut is also high this season.\n\nThere are about 25 lakh agriculture pumpsets availing 24x7 free power supply in the State and the groundwater table has improved by 3 meters as in January compared to the same period last year. Good monsoon rains as well as filling of thousands of minor irrigation tanks with the operation of Kaleshwaram, Kalwakurthy, Nettempadu, Bhima, Koilsagar, Sitarama and Srisailam Left Bank Canal (AMRP) lift irrigation projects as also other smaller lifts has helped improve the average groundwater table from 11.88 meters below ground level to 8.88 meters this January, according to agriculture department officials.\n\n“The intra-day peak on Monday was due to the operation of a maximum number of agriculture pumpsets and running of all the 11 motors with 40 MW capacity each in the Kannepally pump house to lift back Godavari water from Gayatri (Medigadda) barrage to Saraswati (Annaram) barrage for their backward journey towards Sundilla and Yellampally barrages and to Mid Manair reservoir through Nandi Medaram and Laxmipur pump houses as part of the Kaleshwaram project,” the official explained."

South Africa’s livestock auction industry, which includes game such as kudu, is estimated to be worth some 81 billion rand ($5.44 billion) a year.\n\nThe viral disease, which causes lesions and lameness in cattle, sheep and other cloven-hoofed animals but does not affect people, was detected for a second time in November after a previous outbreak in January last year.\n\nAnnouncing the lifting of the auction ban, Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza said some affected farms remain quarantined and any future livestock auctions would need the necessary permits and documentation to trade."

At the same time, farmers are hit by some of the worst effects of climate change. But a coalition of farming groups says they can also be a part of the solution.\n\nFarmers for Climate Solutions is calling for agricultural policy to be redesigned with a climate change lens placed over the entire framework. That means boosting the efforts of farmers to reduce their emissions, enhance soil health, and increase resilience to extreme weather.\n\nGet Grist in your inbox\n\nAlways free, always fresh The Beacon Other choices Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy\n\nMeasures to rein in emissions from agriculture, which would include reducing reliance on costly synthetic fertilizers and herbicides, should also improve farmer’s livelihoods, said the coalition, whose members includes the National Farmers Union, Canadian Organic Growers, FarmFolk CityFolk, Rural Routes to Climate Solutions, and the Ecological Farmers Association of Ontario.\n\n“Farmers are on the front lines of climate change. They’re dealing with the impacts already and being required to find solutions,” said Jane Rabinowicz, the executive director of SeedChange, another member of the coalition. “What we’re saying is the burden shouldn’t be on farmers alone.”\n\nRabinowicz and others in the coalition said government has an important role to play in spreading the word about successful farm innovations and helping to scale them up.\n\n“It’s been several decades now that we really don’t have a significant public extension service,” said Karen Ross, project manager for agriculture at coalition member Équiterre. “It’s been replaced with private extension.”\n\n“Extension service” refers to the application of new scientific methods to farming.\n\n“So that means companies who are selling fertilizers, who are selling pesticides, who are selling seeds, are most of the people that farmers talk to,” she said.\n\nSpreading the word about good practice\n\nGillian Flies, the president of Canadian Organic Growers, represents the type of success story the coalition hopes can be emulated across the country.\n\nShe and her husband, Brent Preston, work full-time on their 100-acre, certified organic farm in Creemore, Ontario, growing salad greens and cucumbers, and supplying some 150 restaurants and a handful of retail stores.\n\nThey have implemented several regenerative practices, which have had a notable effect on their ability to produce in tougher weather conditions.\n\nThese include planting some 12,000 trees, installing 18 beehives and creating protected pollinator and wildlife areas. They also use cover cropping — planting non-yielding crops to suppress weeds, improve soil quality, and manage erosion — and have shifted away from tilling, which releases carbon into the atmosphere and leads to less water retention.\n\nThe measures are producing tangible results.\n\n“Last summer, we had really high temperatures and a long drought, and we were still able to germinate arugula and spinach while farmers in our area who were tilling couldn’t,” Flies said in a phone interview, noting that a research trial they were involved in showed that their soil was 6 degrees cooler than soil on a neighboring farm.\n\n“It’s intimidating until you know how to do it and you hear success stories from other farmers demonstrating their increased profitability, but it really is an opportunity for all farmers,” Flies said.\n\nSoil degradation cost farmers $3.1 billion in lost yield in 2011, according to researchers at the University of Manitoba. It has removed between $40 billion and $60 billion from gross domestic product since the 1970s, they calculated.\n\nEyeing next farm five-year plan starting in 2023\n\nThe coalition is hoping to see their views reflected in the next five-year plan of the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a $3 billion funding mechanism from federal, provincial and territorial governments. The next one will map out policy priorities for 2023 and onwards.\n\nOttawa on Monday shelled out $2 million from the fund to cover half the costs of grain drying, after heavy rains led to a wet harvest last year, meaning dryers had to burn more fuel for longer periods to prevent crops from rotting.\n\nThe increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather damages crops and soil, with unseasonal snow trapping unharvested crops underneath and late frosts killing blossoms on fruit trees.\n\nAgriculture accounts for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada, according to a report released in December by the National Farmers Union, one of the members of the coalition. But the industry is also a promising place to target for fast and effective climate solutions, they said.\n\nThe group estimates that the reimagining of farming they are calling for could cut those emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and perhaps by 50 percent by 2050."

            "content": "Residents of Little Tibet are as much a part of Karnataka as the dosa and idli that the refugees from the Himalayan plateau have adopted into their daily diet.\n\nIn the early 1960s, it would have been a sight to see Tibetan men and women work on the land in a remote part of south India. But the residents of Little Tibet are as much a part of Karnataka as the dosa and idli the refugees from the Himalayan plateau have adopted into their daily diet.\n\n“I still remember when I came here this was a forest area, the government of India built a tent for us and gave food for six months,” remembers Tenzin, who came to Bylakuppe with his parents at the age of six.\n\nThis cluster of 20 villages spread over 3,000 acres in Mysuru district of south Karnataka was chosen for the Tibetan settlement in 1960. “After the China invasion, Dalai Lama requested the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for a place for Tibetan refugees in India. After Nehru wrote to all the states, in 1960, the government of Mysore (now Karnataka government) under Chief Minister S Nijalingappa came forward to give nearly 3,000 acres at Bylakuppe,” explains Thupten Tsering, Lugsam Tibetan Settlement Officer here.\n\nAfter China conquered the Tibetan country in 1950, refugees fled into exile to different parts of the world. Most of them came to India and remain in various camps and settlements across the country. Now, Bylakuppe is home to more than 60,000 Tibetans, the second-largest Tibetan settlement in the world after Dharamsala. Initially, some 3,000 Tibetans moved into the Lugsung Samdupling Tibetan Settlement, the first such in India, before Tibetan Dickey Larsoe was established nearby.\n\nTenzin remembers who his family gradually moved to a concrete house and how he was educated in the local settlement school. “We cultivated maize, ragi (finger millet), cotton, tobacco and vegetables in the tract of land. The government of India was paying men Rs 2 and Rs 1.75 paisa for women to send the children to schools,” says Tenzin, adding how the government was very kind to the refugees.\n\nTsering says that along with the hard work of the displaced settlers there was a lot of help from the local government. “The government allotted the land and officials to help us to convert this plot into our home. This was all forest land then, which we together cleared, made houses on,” adds Tsering, adding one acre of land was distributed for each family to grow food pm.\n\nIn the coming years, six camps were formed in this area. In 1963, the Namdroling Monastery, also known as Golden Temple of the South, was established by Drubwang Padna Norbu Rinpoche and many monks moved in there.\n\nThe Tibetan colony now has three schools till Class 12, an orphanage school, a hospital and a Tibetan local justice committee. The Sera Monastery, modeled after the Sera University in Tibet, is the local seat of education.\n\nIn 1963, the Namdroling Monastery, also known as Golden Temple of the South, was established by Drubwang Padna Norbu Rinpoche and many monks moved in there.

Express Photo by Darshan Devaiah BP\n\nThe initial dependence on agriculture, is the reason the area now has poultry farms and an animal husbandry program along with an active flour mill run by a Cooperative Society. But the settlers soon started branching out to do embroidery and even trade in sweaters and other goods. Some launched restaurants, while the society set up a mechanical workshop, incense factory and a few shops.\n\nInterestingly, some of the refugees even got jobs in government establishments. Pasang, an 80-year-old refugee, took voluntary retirement after working for 25 years at the Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) Limited in Bengaluru. “I went to Bengaluru and took technical training for a year and passed the interview in HMT and started to work there for a monthly salary of Rs 10. Now, I am back in Bylakuppe spending my retirement life happily,” he says in fluent Kannada.\n\nThis was all before Bylakuppe became a major tourist destination. In 1999, the state and central governments helped build the Padmasambhava Buddhist Vihara. The so-called ‘Golden Temple’ has been attracting thousands of tourists daily since it was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama, two decades back.\n\nThe youth are also finding new job avenues. Pema Delek, a member of the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile, says: “While once 90 per cent of the people here were into agriculture, now many of the young are into businesses in other countries and Indian metro cities. But many of those who are here even now also depend on agriculture.”\n\nThe Tibetans have also made it a point to become a part of the local community that accepted the outsiders, not knowing their cause, customs or traditions. Delek confidently says you just need to ask the local police station if there are any criminal cases registered against the Tibetian refugees. “We always respect the local people and culture. Whenever the Dalai Lama visits here, his only advice to us is to respect the local people and the government of India and Karnataka,” he adds.\n\nAnd even as popular restaurants the settlements serve tourists momos and thupka, the Tibetans who started calling this part of south India home almost six decades back now start their days with a crisp dosa and sambhar.\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

            "content": "Odisha may continue to sustain revenue losses on account of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) even after five years, while the existing constitutional provision provides for compensating loss to a State’s revenue for a period of five years only, the State government observed in the annual ‘Odisha Economic Survey’ tabled in the Assembly on Monday.\n\nThe introduction of GST in July 2017 had resulted in 17 taxes levied by the Centre and States being subsumed under the GST.\n\n“With initial... issues related with the implementation of the new tax regime, Odisha has been facing revenue loss,” the government said in its latest economic survey.\n\n“As per the constitutional provisions, the State will get compensation towards loss of revenue for five years. However, the State may continue to sustain loss on account of GST even after five years because of the structural changes like the rate structure, abolition of central sales tax and entry tax,” the government observed.\n\nAs per the economic survey, applying 14% growth rate to the base year’s collection, revenue for 2018-19 is worked out at ₹16,370.08 crore, whereas revenue collection under GST during this period is ₹12,140.45 crore. It implies that compensation claim of the State stands at ₹4,229.64 crore, out of which compensation received so far is ₹3,785 crore. The balance compensation of ₹444.64 crore is yet to be received.\n\nThe Odisha Economic Survey projects Gross State Domestic Product to grow by 6.16% in 2019-20, compared with the 7.9% pace posted in 2018-19.\n\nThe slowdown in the pace of growth has been attributed to lower agricultural production — with output affected by cyclones — and a deceleration in both mining and manufacturing.\n\nAfter a dip in growth in 2014-15, as mining and manufacturing decelerated, Odisha’s economic momentum recovered in 2015-16 to 8%. Thereafter, it jumped to 15.6% in 2016-17 due to high production in agriculture, more fiscal consolidation and an increase in manufacturing output.\n\nGrowth, however, softened in 2017-18 to 6.3% owing to reduced agricultural production and contraction in manufacturing and mining sector. In 2018-19, the pace ticked up to 7.9% on account of higher agricultural output.\n\nThe per capita income of Odisha in 2019-20 is, however, expected to reach ₹1,01,587 up from ₹95,164 in 2018-19. As per advance estimates for 2019-20, the State’s per capita net domestic product at current prices is estimated to grow by 6.75%. During the same period, the per capita net national income is estimated at ₹1,35,050, marking an increase of 6.84% compared with ₹1,26,406 during 2018-19."

            "content": "The new digita­lised system, which has been develo­ped by the depart­ment itself, has an error margin of only ± 5%\n\nLAHORE: After a period of 40 years, the Punjab Agriculture Department has revised the method of analysing the cultivation and production of over 148 various types of crops and has introduced a modern Area Frame Sampling system based on the latest technology.\n\nWhereas the decades-old method to collect 1,240 agricultural samples at the district level has been abolished and a more extensive system to collect crop reporting sample from over 5,500 locations at union council level has been introduced.\n\nAlthough World Bank consultants had asked for millions of dollars to develop the system while Faisalabad University quoted Rs 140 million, the new system has been developed using the agriculture department’s own resources and now at least two samples are being taken from each union council.\n\nThe previous system, owing to manual procedures, had critical flaws in estimating cultivation area and production of all four major crops as well as others. Moreover, the government staff, instead of visiting fields to gather information, would send self-reported statistics to the government, which would lead to issues in formulating agricultural and economic policies.\n\nFAO to help boost climate resilience of crops\n\nAccording to details, for the last 40 years, the Directorate of Crop Reporting Service, established by the Punjab Agriculture Department, had collected only 1,240 agricultural samples collectively at the district level and had estimated the cultivation and production of each crop. While the estimate was also based on the staff’s estimation and statistics rather than actual information gathered from the fields, as all crop reporting was thus far done through paperwork.\n\nTwo years ago, the World Bank had offered the Punjab government to make a new crop reporting system through its consultants for a price of around USD 10 million, under the Smart Program. However, a few months ago, following the directives of Secretary Agriculture Punjab Wasef Khurshid, Director Crop Reporting Service Dr Abdul Qayyum started working on developing the new system locally, which is now near completion. Whereas, the manual system has been completely eliminated and a software dashboard has been included in the new system that works in both, English and Urdu to facilitate the operating staff.\n\nOnce the software is complete, of all 1,058 crop reporters of the department will be required to go to the field to get the crop sample and upload all the details and photos from there to the dashboard. Moreover, multiple dashboard pages have been created, so if a crop reporter tries to feed incomplete or bogus data, the system will not progress and the report will remain incomplete. Minor details of each crop have also been added to the dashboard, with the expectation that it will help the agriculture to not only get the closest data on cultivation area and production but will also help avail important information about fertiliser use, crop patterns, water use, various agricultural diseases and prevention methods.\n\n‘Centre responsible for inflation, losses to farmers’\n\nFurthermore, the new crop reporting system has an error rate of only ± 5%. A system with such a low error rate is very useful considering that in a recent pilot satellite crop survey conducted by a university in the United States in collaboration with Faisalabad University; wheat cultivation in Punjab was reported to be from 11.9 million acres to 22.51 million acres. This means there was a difference of plus or minus 100% in the calculation.\n\nThe sources revealed that since the new crop reporting system has been activated, crop reporters have been facing problems in commuting to the field and the department has asked the government to provide revolving funds so that employees can buy motorcycles on easy instalments. On the other hand, there are 1,605 posts approved for crop reporting service, but only 300 of them are vacant at the moment. Talking to The Express, Secretary Agriculture Punjab Wasif Khurshid said that the crop reporting system, implemented for 40 years, was not compatible with modern requirements. “Various problems were emerging due to unreliable and incomplete data. The new system is fully developed by the department and we will now have the closest data of all crops,” he concluded.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 18th, 2020.\n\nRead full story"

            "content": "The EU aims to create common data spaces to increase the quality of services when it comes to agriculture and healthcare, according to a European Commission data strategy draft seen by EURACTIV.com.\n\nIn the field of agriculture, inspired by a milestone data-sharing deal signed by EU agri-food operators in 2018, the EU executive will propose a common data space to take advantage of the potential of precision agriculture as well as optimise farming controls.\n\nIn April 2018, nine organisations and associations signed the EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing by Contractual Arrangement.\n\nThe objective of the voluntary initiative was to create a framework of cooperation among agri-food chain operators to make the best use of much-needed data in a constantly digitising farming sector.\n\nEU agri-food operators sign milestone data sharing deal In a bid to speed up the exploitation of new technologies in EU farming, a coalition of associations from the EU agri-food chain signed on 23 April a joint EU Code of Conduct on sharing of agricultural data.\n\nAccording to the draft document, data will help EU farming enhance its sustainability performance and competitiveness.\n\n“Processing and analysing production data, especially in combination with other data on the supply chain and other types of data, such as earth observation or meteorological data, allows for a precise and tailored application of production approaches at farm level,” the document reads.\n\nThe Commission says this initiative would eventually lead to a “neutral platform” for sharing and pooling both private and public agricultural data.\n\n“This could support the emergence of an innovative data-driven ecosystem based on fair contractual relations, as well as strengthen the capacities for monitoring […] and reducing administrative burden for government and beneficiaries,” the document added.\n\nThe monitoring of parcels under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has always been a headache for EU member states, with checks on the spot proving largely inefficient so far.\n\nAlready in 2017, an EU official told EURACTIV that the executive was mulling incentives for space technologies in farm controls.\n\nModernising healthcare\n\nAs far as the healthcare sector is concerned, the Commission aims to put forward “legislative or non-legislative” measures for the creation of a common health data space. This was already provided in the mission letter of Ursula von der Leyen to EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides.\n\nAlthough it heavily relies on the “willingness” of EU member states and healthcare providers to make it work in practice, the Commission believes that sharing health data creates a win-win situation for all stakeholders, from citizens and government to pharma industry.\n\nData-sharing, the Commission says, can enable access to and proper assessment of medicines, as well as break the silos when it comes to the portability of EU citizens’ healthcare data from one member state to another, and beyond.\n\n“Citizens have the right in particular to access and control their personal health data and to request their portability, but implementation of this right is fragmented,” the document said.\n\nThe executive explains that electronic health records, strictly in line with the GDPR rules, will help improve access to quality care, achieve cost-effectiveness of care delivery and contribute to the modernisation of health systems.\n\nThe cross-border flow of data has taken centre stage in the discussion in Brussels. Right now, when citizens move to another EU member state, their healthcare data is in fact simply “lost”.\n\nAdvocates of the digitisation of healthcare say data mobility, or the “fifth freedom”, in the EU could unlock the potential of innovation in the sector and make EU patients’ lives easier.\n\nEstonia and Finland first to start exchanging healthcare data by end of year Estonia and Finland will start exchanging digital prescriptions at the end of the year, in a groundbreaking move that Estonian Health Minister Riina Sikkut said she hoped other EU countries will follow.\n\nAccording to the draft, the executive will enable by 2022 the exchange of patients’ electronic summaries and e-Prescriptions among 22 states (participating in the eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure).\n\nThe Commission believes national governments and the industry could also benefit from this initiative.\n\nThe governments will be able to better assess medical products while the industry’s access to health data will help it increase its competitiveness.\n\nThe discussion over value-based healthcare, according to which medicines are paid based on patient health outcomes, is still ongoing in Europe.\n\nAn innovative medicine can frequently increase the survival rate of patients by a couple of years, or improve patients’ everyday life in general. But for critics, this is not enough to remunerate “innovation”.\n\nHowever, the pharma industry insists that all relevant factors should be considered, including the social impact as well as the benefits at the economic level.\n\nIf a patient is able to remain at work for more years, the industry argues, this significantly impacts the general productivity.\n\nA health data space also serves the Commission’s much-awaited EU-wide cancer plan, which seems to rely on a data-driven approach.\n\n“We need to make sure that we are monitoring the progress. And you can only measure if you have the information,” Martin Seychell, deputy director-general for health and food safety at the European Commission, told EURACTIV at the 2019 Gastein Forum, adding that data could range from cancer registries to genomic banks.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]"

I could teach anybody, even people in this room, no offense intended, to be a farmer,” Bloomberg said.\n\n“It’s a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then we had 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs.” (RELATED: ‘You’re A F**king Fascist!’ — Second Amendment Activists Heckle Mike Bloomberg In Virginia)\n\nBut the multi-billionaire businessman said the information economy is not so simple because “the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze” and that is “fundamentally different,” from agriculture or manufacturing, he told the audience.\n\n“You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter. It’s not clear the teachers can teach or the students can learn, and so the challenge of society of finding jobs for these people, who we can take care of giving them a roof over their head and a meal in their stomach and a cell phone and a car and that sort of thing.” (RELATED: Bloomberg Rises To Top, Biden Plummets, In Florida Poll)\n\nBloomberg has been plagued of late by comments he made before announcing his presidential bid. His previous political experience has been as mayor of New York City, where he promoted the “stop and frisk” policy that targeted minorities when police stopped people on the street to search for weapons or drugs.\n\nBloomberg apologized for that policy but audio from a Feb. 6, 2015 Aspen Security Institute event recently surfaced where the former mayor was vigorously defending stop and frisk, even if police had to “throw” minority males “up against the wall and frisk them.”"

            "content": "Long term investing is the way to go, but that doesn't mean you should hold every stock forever. It hits us in the gut when we see fellow investors suffer a loss. Spare a thought for those who held China Green Agriculture, Inc. (NYSE:CGA) for five whole years - as the share price tanked 88%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 55%. Even worse, it's down 23% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. Importantly, this could be a market reaction to the recently released financial results. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.\n\nWe really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Green Agriculture\n\nChina Green Agriculture isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.\n\nIn the last half decade, China Green Agriculture saw its revenue increase by 2.4% per year. That's far from impressive given all the money it is losing. It's not so sure that share price crash of 34% per year is completely deserved, but the market is doubtless disappointed. We'd be pretty cautious about this one, although the sell-off may be too severe. A company like this generally needs to produce profits before it can find favour with new investors.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:CGA Income Statement, February 18th 2020 More\n\nThis free interactive report on China Green Agriculture's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in China Green Agriculture had a tough year, with a total loss of 55%, against a market gain of about 22%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 34% per year over five years. We realise that Buffett has said investors should 'buy when there is blood on the streets', but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand China Green Agriculture better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for China Green Agriculture (1 doesn't sit too well with us) that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.\n\nIf you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The global precision farming market size is anticipated to reach USD 12.9 billion by 2027, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. It is expected to register a CAGR of 13.0% over the forecast period. Precision farming, also known as site-specific crop management or satellite farming, is a farm management concept that uses information technology to ensure optimum health and productivity of crops. The precision farming technique largely depends on specialized equipment such as sensing devices, antennas and access points, and automation and control system. It also involves maintenance services and managed services. Additionally, it incorporates a broad range of technologies such as bio-engineering, robotics and automation, imagery and sensors, and big data.\n\nGrand View Research Logo More\n\nKey suggestions from the report:\n\nIncreasing government support for adopting modern agricultural techniques and growing need for efficiently monitoring the health of crops are expected to drive market growth\n\nCloud-based software model is anticipated to gain significant precision farming market share over the projected period as it reduces energy consumption and provides storage for large amount of data while facilitating cost saving\n\nInnovations in GPS mapping and related farming applications are enabling farmers to operate more efficiently and increase their profit margins\n\nDemand for drones is expected to grow in the agriculture field as they are increasingly used in monitoring irrigation systems\n\nYield monitoring finds wide applications in soil monitoring as it helps detect the properties of soil for increasing yields\n\nDigital revolution in the agricultural sector, along with government financial incentives to farms, is likely to drive demand for precision farming in Europe in the forthcoming years\n\nAsia Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth owing to availability of the largest agricultural land, which provides growth opportunities in countries such as China , India , Australia , and Japan\n\nKey players in the precision agriculture market include Agribotix LLC (U.S.); Deere & Company (U.S.); SST Development Group, Inc. (U.S.); Farmers Edge, Inc. ( Canada ); and Granular, Inc. (U.S.).\n\nRead 150 page research report with ToC on \"Precision Farming Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Offering, By Application (Yield Monitoring, Weather Tracking, Field Mapping, Crop Scouting), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2020 - 2027\" at: https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/precision-farming-market\n\nGrowing number of applications for telematics in agriculture is anticipated to drive demand for precision farming over the projected period. Telematics services include tracking devices using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to show the position of the equipment for management purposes. Major manufacturers of agriculture equipment are adopting telematics services for their equipment to improve farm efficiency, thereby reducing the cost of agricultural operations and maximizing profitability. Additionally, improved management can help reduce environmental impact. Telematics technology is used to capture and transfer data from the farm equipment through sensors installed on tractors and other field monitoring equipment. The increasing adoption of telematics systems by agricultural equipment companies is expected to drive the precision agriculture market.\n\nFurthermore, with advancements in GPS guidance and automation, drones are poised to transform the agriculture industry. The ability of drones to precisely analyze the soil at the beginning of the crop cycle and detect a plant infected with bacteria or fungus is anticipated to propel the growth of the drone segment.\n\nHowever, low rate of technology adoption among farmers is likely to hamper market growth over the forecast period. This may be due to factors such as absence of stringent standards and limitations on the exchange of data. Furthermore, farmers lack independent consulting and advisory services owing to the absence of validated agronomic models for Variable Rate Technology (VRT) to make decisions on investments. In addition, independent services are not linked to co-operatives, government bodies, and farmer's associations where farmers can get additional information to make improved decisions.\n\nGrand View Research has segmented the global precision farming market based on offering, application, and region:\n\nPrecision Farming Offering Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2016 - 2027)\n\nPrecision Farming Application Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2016 - 2027)\n\nPrecision Farming Regional Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2016 - 2027)\n\nFind more research reports on Next Generation Technologies Industry, by Grand View Research:\n\nArtificial Intelligence in Agriculture Market – Global artificial intelligence in agriculture market size was valued at USD 608.9 million in 2018 and is anticipated to register a CAGR of 25.4% from 2019 to 2025.\n\n– Global artificial intelligence in agriculture market size was valued at in 2018 and is anticipated to register a CAGR of 25.4% from 2019 to 2025.

About 54% of milk produced is marketable surplus and remaining 46% is retained in villages for local consumption. Out of the marketable surplus available with farmers only 36% is handled by organised sectors evenly shared by cooperative and private sector. There is a need to bring the remaining 64% surplus milk under the organized fold through various interventions. During last 2 years milk procurement is also growing by about 9% in Cooperative sector.\n\nDepartment of Animal Husbandry & Dairying is continuously working towards increasing milk productivity through genetic improvement and reduction of input cost. Special programme has also been launched recently for improvement of milk quality by providing required testing facilities at village and dairy plant level for safe human consumption. It is proposed to further intensify the Quality Milk Programme for both cooperative and private sector with fund sharing basis. With a thrust on better productivity, reduced input cost and better quality milk and milk product, the competitiveness and profitability in the dairy sector will get enhanced leading to increased demand of dairy products in domestic and international market. This would also bring private investments in the sector to boost growth in rural income and also employment.\n\nPublic investment to further incentivise private investments would be facilitated for increasing processing facilities through convergence and leveraging the schemes of Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare, Department of Rural Development and State Governments.\n\n****\n\nAPS"

            "content": "The AIADMK government has presented a Budget without populist schemes. DMK IT wing head and legislator Palanivel Thiagarajan, a former banker, contends that populist schemes might come as part of the Chief Minister’s announcements and why such announcements under Rule 110 in the Assembly are bad. In an interview with The Hindu on Sunday, he accuses the AIADMK government of managing the economy badly and also talks about his party affairs. Excerpts:\n\nJust a year before the 2021 Assembly polls, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in the last full Budget of this government did not announce any populist scheme. Do you think rising debts could be a reason?\n\nThey [The government] have already projected rather massive schemes and grants and subsidies year after year. Just because the Finance Minister has not announced populist schemes, doesn’t mean they are not going to do it. I believe these numbers [provided in the Tamil Nadu Budget] are just meaningless numbers. The gap between what they said they will do in the Budget, what they said they have done in revised estimates and what they end up doing eventually is huge. Even between the revised estimate and the final account, there has been an increase. In the 2019-2020 Budget, they said they would have a revenue deficit of ₹14,000 crore in 2019-20, but in the revised estimate the figure went up to ₹25,000 crore. They have perfected the art of funny money accounting.\n\nIn the old days, Ministers did their respective jobs. But now, the Chief Minister has to announce all new schemes under Rule 110. I guarantee you that between now and Thursday next, the CM will make some announcements under Rule 110. This is bad not just for democracy, but also for administration. It is bad for administration because it concentrates power in one person. Bad for democracy, in the sense, what is the point of having a legislature and a Cabinet? So, I don’t yet share your optimism that because of the large debt, they will not undertake irresponsible populist schemes.\n\nThe DMK aspires to come to power in 2021, and if that happens, how do you plan to handle the situation of the rising debt and manage the economy?\n\nI am not senior enough in the party to make policy decisions. My leader will show us the way. But in my professional opinion, as a former banker, I think we have to consider some fundamental restructuring, because we have reached a point where the non-discretionary spending – pensions, salary, non-wage operational and maintenance expense and interest charges – has taken up almost 100% of the State’s own revenue. That means there is no money left to do anything discretionary. However, you cannot really cut any of the first three non-discretionary spending items, but you can cut down the fourth – interest charges.

            "content": "The AIADMK government has presented a Budget without populist schemes. DMK IT wing head and legislator Palanivel Thiagarajan, a former banker, contends that populist schemes might come as part of the Chief Minister’s announcements and why such announcements under Rule 110 in the Assembly are bad. In an interview with The Hindu on Sunday, he accuses the AIADMK government of managing the economy badly and also talks about his party affairs. Excerpts:\n\nJust a year before the 2021 Assembly polls, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in the last full Budget of this government did not announce any populist scheme. Do you think rising debts could be a reason?\n\nThey [The government] have already projected rather massive schemes and grants and subsidies year after year. Just because the Finance Minister has not announced populist schemes, doesn’t mean they are not going to do it. I believe these numbers [provided in the Tamil Nadu Budget] are just meaningless numbers. The gap between what they said they will do in the Budget, what they said they have done in revised estimates and what they end up doing eventually is huge. Even between the revised estimate and the final account, there has been an increase. In the 2019-2020 Budget, they said they would have a revenue deficit of ₹14,000 crore in 2019-20, but in the revised estimate the figure went up to ₹25,000 crore. They have perfected the art of funny money accounting.\n\nIn the old days, Ministers did their respective jobs. But now, the Chief Minister has to announce all new schemes under Rule 110. I guarantee you that between now and Thursday next, the CM will make some announcements under Rule 110. This is bad not just for democracy, but also for administration. It is bad for administration because it concentrates power in one person. Bad for democracy, in the sense, what is the point of having a legislature and a Cabinet? So, I don’t yet share your optimism that because of the large debt, they will not undertake irresponsible populist schemes.\n\nThe DMK aspires to come to power in 2021, and if that happens, how do you plan to handle the situation of the rising debt and manage the economy?\n\nI am not senior enough in the party to make policy decisions. My leader will show us the way. But in my professional opinion, as a former banker, I think we have to consider some fundamental restructuring, because we have reached a point where the non-discretionary spending – pensions, salary, non-wage operational and maintenance expense and interest charges – has taken up almost 100% of the State’s own revenue. That means there is no money left to do anything discretionary. However, you cannot really cut any of the first three non-discretionary spending items, but you can cut down the fourth – interest charges. Total interest charges have escalated beyond all measures.\n\nPeople who do not admit their problems, can’t begin to fix them. I have been saying since 2016 that our State’s biggest problem is that the revenue as a percentage on GSDP [Gross State Domestic Product] has dropped dramatically.

( Representational Image/File)\n\nThe Canadian government is keen to capitalise on Vadodara’s inherent capability of business and trade and tap its potential in the education and IT sectors, a senior official from the North American country has said. A Canadian delegation was in Gujarat’s Vadodara city on Friday to meet top business and industry players in a move to strengthen trade relations with tier-2 cities of India.\n\nAfter the meeting, Consul and Head of Trade & Investment at the Consulate General of Canada in Mumbai, Carlos Rojas-Arbulu told PTI that the Indo-Canadian Business Chamber is also contemplating to open a representative office\n\nin Vadodara to boost trade ties with the city.\n\nAiming to tap potential in areas of education, Information Technology and manufacturing sector, the Canadian government is eyeing to enhance two-way trade with Vadodara, the third largest city in Gujarat, he said. “It’s the time to tap the potential of cities like Vadodara that already has ties with Canada. These ties can be further enhanced and new ones can be explored,” he said.\n\nHe said information and communications technology is one of the top priority areas of the Canadian government, followed by the automotive sector, agriculture, clean technology and infrastructure, among others. “There is immense potential for Vadodara to collaborate with Canada in areas of education, digitisation, food and cleantech as well as bilateral trade between small and medium businesses,” he said.\n\nThe bilateral trade between India and Canada is about $10 billion that is estimated to grow to $60 billion in the next five years, the envoy said.\n\nCanada also sees a huge opportunity to associate with Vadodara in the field of education, which is directly co-related to the growth of industries in the region, he said.\n\n“In this context, Vadodara hits all the right chords when it comes to doing business with Canada.\n\nWe also realise that India’s drive towards becoming USD five trillion economy rests on the shoulders of important cities like Vadodara, and Canada can help the city in realising its full potential,” the official said\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

In the last 10 years, exports have pumped an extra $1.25 billion into the economy of 15 American states.Officials said the lower tariff demand had been around for some time and the issue had come up ahead of Trump’s visit to India on February 24-25.Some American senators have highlighted the “disparity” in tariffs that India charges on tree nuts that has created an “unlevel playing field” for American producers. While the tariff on American pecans entering India is around 36%, those on almonds and pistachios is 10%.“Reducing trade barriers into India is an opportunity to strengthen the economy of rural America,” the senators wrote in a letter to United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer late last year.In 2018-19, India imported fruit and nuts worth $840 million from the US, of which around $626 million were almonds.Experts said since these products are not grown here, it is easy for India to grant access.“This goes beyond the normal that the US is looking for. Trump wants a few states, which seem like swing states, to be happy and such products may emerge in the trade talks,” said a Delhi-based expert on trade issues.The US is among the biggest exporters of pork in the world and sees a big potential for its products in India.Agriculture and dairy have been crucial in the India-US trade talks. New Delhi has ruled out any tariff cuts for American milk but insisted on mandatory certification of dairy products by veterinary officials, specifying that the source animal was not raised on feed made of bovine extracts.On the other hand, India is keen to get US market access for its mangoes and grapes."

The scheme has been introduced to assist State Governments to issue soil health cards to all farmers in the country. Soil health card provides information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility.\n\nFinancial Progress of Soil Health Card Scheme:\n\n(Rs in crore)\n\nYear Funds released 2014-15 23.89 2015-16 96.47 2016-17 133.66 2017-18 152.76 2018-19 237.40 2019-20 107.24 Total 751.42\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, in Cycle 1,10.74 crore soil health cards were distributed to farmers. In Cycle-II (2017-19),11.69crore soil health cards have been distributed to farmers across the country.\n\nEstablishment of Soil Testing Labs: So far 429 New Static Soil Testing Labs (STLs), 102 New Mobile STLs, 8752 Mini STLs have been provided. Village level soil testing facilities(VLSTLS) by agri-entrepreneurs have also been promoted and so far 1562 VLSTLs have been sanctioned and strengthening of 800 existing STLs have been sanctioned to States/UTs under the scheme. Thus the soil analyzing capacity has increased from 1.78 to 3.33 crore soil samples per annum in short period of 5 years.\n\nSoil Health Card provides two sets of fertilizer recommendations for six crops including recommendations of organic manures. Farmers can also get recommendations for additional crops on demand. They can also print the card as their own from SHC portal. SHC portal has farmers database of both the cycles and is available in 21 languages for the benefit of the farmers.\n\nOrganization of demonstrations, trainings and farmer melas: So far 5.50 lakh demonstrations on SHC recommendation, 8898 farmer’s trainings and 7425 farmer’s melas have been sanctioned to States/UTs under the scheme.\n\nDuring 2019-20, a pilot project ‘Development of Model Villages’ has been undertaken up where soil samples collection has been done at individual farm holding with farmer’s participation instead of sample collection at grids.Under the pilot project, one village per block is adopted for land holding based soil sampling, testing and organization of larger number of demonstrations up to a maximum number of 50 demonstrations (1 ha each) for each adopted village. This will result in acceptance of Soil Health Card by farmers.\n\nSo far 6954 villages have been identified by the States/UTs in which against the target of 26.83 lakh samples, 20.18 lakh samples have been collected, 14.65 lakh samples have been analyzed and 13.54 lakh cards have been distributed to farmers. Apart from this 246968 demonstrations and 6951 farmer melas have been approved for States/UTs.\n\nAwareness among farmers is being stepped up by coordinated efforts of Departments of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Fertilisers backed by technology and network of KrishiVigyanKendras of Indian Council of Agriculture Research. Farmer can track their samples, print their Cardsetc at Common Service Centres also at the Farmers Corner of www.soilhealth.gov.in and fulfil the mantra of SwasthaDhara to Khet Hara (if the soil is healthy, the fields will be green).\n\nPlease click here for\n\nStudy on Impact of Soil Health Card Scheme by National Productivity Council\n\n****\n\nAPS/PK"

            "content": "A hamburger made out of cell-based meat by Mosa Meat, one of many companies throughout the world ... [+] creating beef and other animal products without the animal. Mosa Meat\n\nUp until now, plant-based food companies like Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and Quorn have almost singlehandedly worked to lessen the impacts of industrial animal agriculture.\n\nSupermarket shelves and fast food restaurants across the US are serving up vegan burgers and meatballs and plant-based chicken nuggets are showing consumers there is an alternative to relying on animal-based protein.\n\nBut a quiet revolution is also taking place in labs, where scientists are working to cultivate meat and seafood grown from cells, with the potential to reduce demand for industrial animal agriculture even further.\n\nHere’s how the process works: Stem cells are taken from the muscle of an animal, usually with a small biopsy under anesthesia, then they’re put with nutrients, salts, pH buffers, and growth factor and left to multiply. Finessing the technology and getting the cost to an affordable level is happening at a slower pace than the plant-based industry, but a number of start-ups are nevertheless aiming to get their products on the market soon.\n\nMemphis Meats' pan-seared cell-based chicken with sugar snap peas. Memphis Meats\n\nCell-based meat (also known as cultured, cultivated, slaughter-free, cell-cultured, and clean meat) could be a common sight in supermarkets across the west in the next three years, according to the Institute of the Future in Palo Alto. California-based Memphis Meats made headlines for its world-first cell-based meatballs four years ago, and is currently building a pilot plant to produce its cultured beef, chicken, and duck on a bigger scale – with plans to launch more plants around the world.\n\nAnd it isn’t the only cell-based meat start-up in the The Golden State. There’s the recently formed San Francisco-based Artemys Foods, co-founded by biochemist Jess Krieger, who has spent the past six years working at Kent State University in Ohio growing cell-based meat in a lab, Berkeley-based Mission Barns, focused on creating animal fat, which it has mixed with other ingredients to make duck sausages, and San Diego-based BlueNalu, a startup developing seafood from fish cells through a process called “cellular aquaculture.”\n\nClose up of BlueNalu's whole-muscle, cell-based yellowtail, beer-battered and deep-fried for fish ... [+] tacos. BlueNalu\n\nBut innovation isn’t limited to the US – it’s happening across the world. The global cell-based meat market is predicted to be worth $15.5m by 2021 and $20m by 2027, according to analysis. One report estimates that 35% of all meat will be cultured by 2040.\n\nWhile estimates vary, one study found that cell-based beef is projected to use 95 per cent fewer global greenhouse gas emissions, 98 per cent less land use and up to half as much energy. It also significantly reduces the amount of antibiotics needed, which are widely used in agriculture and contribute hugely to worsening antibiotic resistance. And since the animal cells are extracted humanely and grown in a facility rather than within the animals themselves, cell-based meat has the potential to all but eliminate animal suffering.\n\nThe industry has made huge progress since the first cell-based hamburger was unveiled in 2013 in London by Dutch stem cell researcher Mark Post, chief scientific officer at Dutch company Mosa Meat. While this was a huge achievement, it also showed the world how far the industry had to go before commercially viable cell-based meat could be a reality. It cost $325,000 to make, and wasn’t totally animal-free, as most of the burger’s muscle strands were grown with fetal bovine serum, which comes from blood drawn from bovine fetuses.\n\nIn the intervening years, Mosa Meat has made several breakthroughs, and aims to bring the price down to a commercial price. It now doesn’t require fetal bovine serum, and has developed a process that allows industrial scale production.\n\nCell-based tartar (raw minced beef, commonly eaten in some of the Northern European countries), ... [+] created by Mosa Meat. Mosa Meat\n\nAlso in the Netherlands, start-up Meatable has recently raised €9m to help reduce costs and scale-up production of its beef and pork. It aims to have an industry-scale plant by 2025, and will have a small-scale bioreactor – the machine where cell-growth takes place - this year. Meatable’s cofounder Krijn de Nood hopes to unveil its first prototype this summer.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, the UK’s Higher Steaks is growing stem cells for the production of mince for pork sausages. Instead of using fetal bovine serum, the company uses protocols exclusively licensed to it by its collaborators, the University of Minnesota, that allow it to reprogram stem cells into muscle and fat tissues.\n\nInstead of adult stem cells, it uses induced pluripotent stem cells, which means they have an infinite supply as the cells proliferate infinitely. With adult stem cells, researchers have to go to the animal every time they need a new batch.\n\nAnd Spain’s Cubiq Foods is producing cell-based fat, which is used to enhance the flavor of food and enrich it with essential fatty acids, such as omega-3.\n\nBut when it comes to cell-based meat, all eyes are on Israel, where a number of start-ups like Future Meat Technologies and SuperMeat are making huge progress. The country’s interest in cell-based meat has also been attributed to its thriving vegan culture.\n\nComparison of Future Meat Technologies' cell-based chicken (left) to of farm-raised chicken (right). ... [+] Future Meat Technologies\n\nFuture Meat Technologies, founded in 2018, has shortened the manufacturing process to two weeks, with a patent-pending method they say allows for higher production yields of cell-based beef. The start-up's technologies enable producers, farmers and retailers to manufacture biomass and process it locally. The company hopes to get cost down to $10 per pound by 2022.\n\nAs for SuperMeat, it is developing cell-based meat from chicken cells (it claimed during its launch in 2016 that it was the first company to work on clean chicken products for mass production). One of Europe's largest poultry producers, PHW-Gruppe formed a partnership with SuperMeat in 2018. “We believe 2020 will be the tipping point for the cultivated meat industry, once the proof of scale will be introduced to the world,” says Shir Friedman, Co-Founder and Chief Communications Officer of the company. “SuperMeat is excited to take a lead part in this historical event.\"\n\nAn illustration of SuperMeat's cell-based meat cultivators of the future. SuperMeat\n\nAnother Israeli start-up, Aleph Farms, created the world’s first cell-based steak at the end of 2018. It was co-founded only one year prior together with The Kitchen Hub from the Strauss Group, and with Professor Shulamit Levenberg of the Technion Institute of Technology. And in fall of 2019, Aleph Farms successfully “3D printed” meat on the International Space Station. “Our experiment of bioprinting meat in space... consisted of printing a small-scale muscle tissue using 3D Bioprinting Solutions’ bioprinting technology,” says Yoav Reisler, External Relations Manager for the company. “The proof of concept sought to assess the potential of producing cultivated meat in a zero-gravity environment away from land and local water resources. Our approach for cultivating beef steaks is imperative to the experiment, as it relies on mirroring the natural process of tissue regeneration that happens in a cow’s body but under controlled and animal-free conditions. Our overarching goal is to produce meat products that have a significantly reduced ecological impact and this was a milestone in towards achieving that.” Earlier this month, Aleph Farms announced plans to open an educational complex next to its production facility to provide the general public a more in-depth view of how cell-based meat is grown.\n\nThin-cut beef steaks cultivated by Aleph Farms. Aleph Farms\n\nAlso in Israel, BioFood Systems aims to produce beef products using bovine embryonic stem cells. It also hopes to scale up technology that it can license globally to enable meat manufacturers to produce their own cell-based meat.\n\nBut other parts of the world aren’t far behind Israel, including Asia. Singaporean Shiok Meats is working on bringing cell-based based crustaceans (shrimp, crab and lobster) to market, and says it’s the first company of its kind in Singapore and South-East Asia. It hopes to have a commercially viable product in the next few years, and is currently researching and developing.\n\nShiok Meats’ cell-grown shrimp dumplings. Shiok Meats\n\nAnd in Japan, meat producer Toriyama and its export agent, Awano Food Group has partnered with JUST to grow, distribute and sell its cell-based wagyu beef worldwide.\n\nJUST doesn't yet have images of its cell-based wagyu because it’s still in early stage R&D, but it ... [+] may one day look like this animal-based piece of Wagyu beef steak seen here. Toriyama\n\nIn-between Asia and Europe, innovation is also happing in Turkey. Biftek is the first and still the only company developing cultured meat in the country. It uses a plant-based formulation, made up of 44 proteins, in place of fetal bovine serum. Founder Can Akcali said in a recent interview that the media in Turkey is showing a growing interest in its work, and cell-based meat more widely.\n\nSince the first cell-based unveiling of a cell-based burger in 2013, scientists have been flocking to labs in a race to iron out numerous teething problems and be the first to make a commercially viable cell-based meat product. Meanwhile, private investment into the industry has soared. Last year, twelve companies raised $50 million in 14 deals – double the amount of 2018. US-based Memphis Meats raised $22 million, Spain's Cubiq Foods raised $14 million and Mosa Meat drew in $9 million.\n\nMemphis Meats now plans to build a pilot production facility, thanks to additional investments in January this year from Cargill and Tyson Foods, as well as high-profile investors Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Kimbal Musk.\n\nIdo Savir, SuperMeat’s chief executive, said Mosa Meat introduced the concept of cell-based meat to the world, and that the main challenge start-ups are still facing is proof of scaling up production to a commercially viable size that's cost-efficient. Once these hurdles are overcome, it will be a much smoother process to get cell-based meat on shelves. At the moment, cell-based products are being prototyped in labs - but once scientists have finessed the process and the cost, they’re produced at scale and can grow in facilities like any other food.\n\nMany cell-based start-ups expect to get their products to market in the next few years. Whether or not they are actually able to meet that projection is an open question. “I worry most startups in the cultured meat space are overestimating their short-term timeline to get to market and underestimating their potential long-term impact on completely redesigning our food system from the cell-level up,” says Max Elder, Research Director in the Food Futures Lab at Institute for the Future. “Regardless of the timeline, one thing is clear: we desperately need to undo the damage industrialized animal agriculture is wreaking on our communities, animals, and the planet.” While it may indeed be unwise to count our cultured chickens before they hatch, especially in light of the urgent challenges we are facing, we can no doubt expect more innovation in the coming years. Perhaps one day - even if not in the near future - all the meat on our plates will indeed be slaughter-free."

            "content": "The Kominek family farm is a green expanse of hay and alfalfa in northern Colorado. The family has planted and raked crops for half a century, but as yields declined over recent years, the farm began losing money. In late 2017, Byron Kominek went looking for more profitable alternatives, including installing solar panels and selling electricity to the utility. But Boulder County’s land-use codes made it difficult to use their 24 acres for anything but farming.\n\nSo the Komineks found a compromise: a solar array with plants growing beneath, between, and around rows of photovoltaic panels.\n\nConstruction is slated to begin this spring on a 1.2-megawatt solar array on the Kominek farm. Some 3,300 solar panels will rest on 6-foot and 8-foot-high stilts, providing shade for crops like tomatoes, peppers, kale, and beans on a five-acre plot. Pasture grasses and beehive boxes are planned for the perimeter.\n\nGet Grist in your inbox\n\nAlways free, always fresh The Beacon Other choices Ask your climate scientist if Grist is right for you. See our privacy policy\n\n“Now there will be potentially more food grown in the community, more renewable energy, and more revenue to local farms,” said Kominek, 37, whose late grandfather Jack bought the farm in 1972.\n\nIf successful, the project could serve as a model for other cash-strapped farmers, by transforming underperforming fields into potentially money-making hubs of clean energy and fresh food.\n\nXcel Energy, the state’s biggest utility, has agreed to pay for each kilowatt-hour delivered from the Kominek’s solar array to the grid. Their neighbors can buy into the project, too. Participants invest in a percentage of the array, then receive credits on their monthly utility bills. Their investment also helps defray some of the farmers’ upfront construction costs.\n\nThe vegetables will be sold through a community farm-share program, which allows neighbors to invest in the project in exchange for boxes of produce.\n\nThis marriage of agriculture and solar photovoltaics — known by the awkward name “agrivoltaics” — is an emerging niche within the broader solar power industry.\n\nIn the United States, less than 5 megawatts’ worth of solar arrays have crops planted beneath them, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL. That’s barely a speck of the country’s 71,300 megawatts of installed solar capacity. The farm-plus-solar sector is relatively bigger in Japan, where the concept first emerged over a decade ago. Hundreds of projects now exist, including a 35-megawatt solar array that hovers over fields of ginseng, herbs, and coriander.\n\nProponents say that this approach could allow for widespread renewable energy development without displacing much-needed land for food. Recent studies suggest that it could lead to more efficient energy and crop production by creating a cooler, moister microclimate.\n\nIn a recent test in Arizona, scientists compared crops planted under solar panels with those grown in direct sunlight. They found that total fruit production for red chiltepin peppers was three times higher on the plots under the panels, and cherry tomatoes doubled production. Some of these plants used significantly less irrigation water, in part because the shaded soil retained more moisture. Solar panels placed with plants were also substantially cooler during the day — and therefore operated more efficiently — than the usual ground-mounted arrays, according to the study last year by NREL and the Universities of Arizona and Maryland.\n\nA project in South Deerfield, Massachusetts, delivered similarly promising results. Early field tests showed that Swiss chard, broccoli, and similar vegetables produced about 60 percent more volume compared to plants beneath a full sun.\n\nKominek’s project, called Jack’s Solar Garden, will provide more opportunities to study agrivoltaics. NREL, in nearby Golden, Colorado, plans to track how plants and panels perform together in Boulder County’s hot, dry climate. “If the structures help keep in moisture, and we have less evaporation, we’ll need less water to grow the same amount or even more [crops],” said Jordan Macknick, the lead energy-water-land analyst for NREL.\n\nMacknick leads NREL’s low-impact solar initiative along with biologist Brenda Beatty. Since 2015, researchers have developed more than 25 sites around the country that combine solar panels with food crops, native vegetation, or pollinator-friendly plants.\n\nJack’s Solar Garden will be the biggest of the group and the first to include all three types. NREL is also adding solar projects in Puerto Rico, including one on a coffee plantation and another one on pasture lands for cattle.\n\n“We’re really just at the very beginning of understanding the benefits of agrivoltaics and what they could mean not only for the energy sector but also for the agricultural sector,” Macknick said.\n\nAgrivoltaics, also called “solar sharing,” first took off in Japan in 2004, after an engineer, Akira Nagashima, developed a stilted steel structure that raises panels 10-feet high. Available land is scarce in Japan, a country with ambitious targets for developing renewable energy. (Not coincidentally, floating solar arrays — which sit atop irrigation ponds and reservoirs — also got their start in Japan, in 2007.) Recently, Nagashima has begun studying how shade-intolerant crops might fare beneath solar arrays. His research team recently found that corn yields slightly improved in a solar-sharing system.\n\nBeyond research sites, however, pairing corn and other cash crops with solar may present significant challenges. On existing plots, smaller tractors can navigate the narrow spaces between rows of panels. But combine harvesters and other industrial equipment are too wide and bulky to fit through the gaps. Most crops grown beneath panels must be picked by hand. The work is manageable at the scale of a community garden, but it can be grueling, back-breaking work at an industrial scale. Farmers are developing machines to pick strawberries, melons, and tomatoes, which also might bump against the panels.\n\nFor farms big and small, a lack of rural infrastructure remains a “key impediment” to boosting adoption of agrivoltaics, said Chad Higgins, an associate professor of biological and ecological engineering at Oregon State University. Power lines and electrical equipment might not be equipped to handle the addition of solar power. Roads and communications networks likewise might need to be expanded to support far-flung operations, he said.\n\nStill, if farmers and engineers can address such hurdles, the potential for agrivoltaics is immense, given how much of the planet’s land is devoted to agriculture. If these “solar-sharing” systems covered even less than 1 percent of the world’s cropland, they could produce enough solar power to meet the world’s annual energy needs, Higgins and other researchers said in an analysis last year. They found that the best places for growing crops are the same areas with strong potential for producing solar power, particularly in the western United States, southern Africa, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n“We have this vision of solar panels out in the desert, in these really open arid areas,” Higgins said. But solar panels are most efficient in climates with plenty of sun and moderate temperatures. Extreme heat can overtax the panels and result in lower electricity production. The same is true for plants.\n\nAt Jack’s Solar Garden in Colorado, the solar array construction this spring will kick off a list of related efforts. The Komineks will plant grasses to help prepare the five-acre plot for next year’s vegetable crops, and local members of the National Audubon Society will start planting a large pollinator habitat around the project’s perimeter. The 1.2-megawatt array is expected to begin delivering electricity to Xcel Energy’s grid by early fall.\n\nByron Kominek said he hopes similar projects will soon follow. In 2018, Boulder County officials updated the local land-use codes to allow for community solar on land otherwise designated for agriculture, and Kominek plans to help train other farmers how to grow crops alongside solar panels. “The hope is that young farmers will have a better understanding of how to do this, and will go out to already built solar arrays, or planned solar arrays, and find a new profession,” he said."

Farmers are shifting to other crops. If the government encourages farmers by purchasing from them at a good price, they would take up paddy cultivation”, he said.\n\nOrganic farming\n\nHe also appealed to the State government to take up a massive campaign to promote organic farming. “Agricultural scientists have made farmers grow crops using chemicals for years. This has affected the health of many people. In the interest of people’s health, the government should promote organic farming”, he said.\n\nMr. Angirasa opined that the government should strengthen farmers economically, by providing them scientific price for their products, in place of schemes to waive loans.\n\nInterestingly, he suggested that the government reduce the expenses at Raj Bhavan, the Governor’s residence. “The Governor is necessary in a federal structure. But the expenses incurred to maintain the system should be minimal”, he said. He has also suggested abolition of the Legislative Council."

            "content": "By Lambert Strether of Corrente\n\nIn my perambulations through the biosphere, I have not yet entered the animal kingdom, so I thought perhaps it was time.[1] Why locusts? Because the Horn of Africa is experiencing one of the world’s periodic locust invasions, and a Plague of Locusts seems very on brand for 2020 so far. From Science Direct:\n\nSchistocerca gregaria the desert locust is a species of locust. Plagues of desert locusts have threatened agricultural production in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia for centuries. The desert locust is potentially the most dangerous of the locust pests because of the ability of swarms to fly rapidly across great distances. It has two to five generations per year.\n\n(We’ll get to “gregaria” in a moment.) Since writing “desert locust” would get tiresome, when I write “locust,” “desert locust” is what I mean.\n\nLocusts are “the oldest migratory pest in the world“; the Bible has a good deal of information about them. For example, locusts, individually, are nutritious. Matt 3:4:\n\n4 And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.\n\nLocusts, when swarming, also have an interesting social structure (as we shall see). Proverbs 30:27:\n\n27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands.\n\nFinally, swarming locusts are often seen as symbols of evil and harbingers of change in the social order: Exodus 10:1,4, 12-14:\n\n1 [ The Eighth Plague: Locusts ] Now the Lord said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants, that I may show these signs of Mine before him, 4 Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory….12 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land—all that the hail has left.” 13 So Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested on all the territory of Egypt. They were very severe; previously there had been no such locusts as they, nor shall there be such after them.\n\n(Of course, in the time of Moses, COVID-19 was not known. Or private equity.)\n\nSkipping over the nutritional value of locusts (“They’re healthy; they’re plentiful; they’re kosher“), we’ll first look at the extent of today’s locust swarms. Then we’ll look at how locust swarms form and move (all without a king, as the bible says). Next, we’ll look at possible effects of this year’s locust invasions. Finally, we’ll look at locusts, climate change, and failed states.\n\nHere is the extent of locust swarms in 2020 so far, which the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) regards as “alarming”:\n\n(I don’t know what the arrow from India to the Horn of Africa signifies; the FAO does not say that today’s invasions began in India, and I don’t think locust swams fly across the ocean. Perhaps individuals are carried by wind?) And soon there will be many more swarms. Deutsche Welle:\n\nThe UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned Sunday that nymph (baby) desert locusts maturing in Somalia’s rebel-held backcountry, where aerial spraying is next to unrealizable, will develop wings in the “next three or four weeks” and threaten millions of people already short of food. Once in flight and hungry, the swarm could be the “most devastating plague of locusts in any of our living memories if we don’t reduce the problem faster than we are doing at the moment,” said UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock. The locusts were now “very hungry teenagers,” but once mature, their progeny would hatch, generating “about a 20-fold increase” in numbers, warned Keith Cressman, FAO locust forecasting officer.\n\nHere are images of a locust swarm in Pakistan; there are similar images from the Horn of Africa:\n\nIn pics: locusts swarming in eastern Pakistan's Punjab Province. pic.twitter.com/M1Y6D5OxOG — People's Daily, China (@PDChina) February 16, 2020\n\nSo, how do locust swarms form and move? I had thought, as I had done with previous excursions into the biosphere (mangroves, estuaries, soil) to seek a classification system, and then fit locusts within them. In fact, a locust is a grasshopper (with big hind legs for leaping, like crickets) that under certain environmental conditions becomes “gregarious.” I hate to quote Wikipedia, but this really is the best explanation I could find in my research:\n\nLocusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions . In English, the term “locust” is used for grasshopper species that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding, forming swarms that develop from bands of immature stages called hoppers. The change is referred to in the technical literature as “density-dependent phenotypic plasticity” . These changes are examples of phase polymorphism ; they were first analysed and described by Boris Uvarov, who was instrumental in setting up the Anti-Locust Research Centre Swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period…. When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming. The mutual attraction between individual insects continues into adulthood, and they continue to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals at the front of the swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.\n\n(The brain of a gregarious locust is 30% larger than a solitary locust’s. Locusts also, apparently, have an internal “sky compass,” but there’s no evidence that they navigate, as opposed to simply heading downwind or seeking greenery.) Locusts — and I can easily say this, since I am not a farmer whose fields are being eaten by them — are truly a wonder of nature. (Also, “density-dependent phenotypic plasticity” and “phase polymorphism” are surely Words of the Day, somewhere.) Locust swarms can be truly enormous. From the Economist, one swarm contained “nearly 200 billion of the creatures and occupied a space in the sky three times the size of New York City.” Who needs a king when you have serotonin?\n\nTurning to the effects of locust swarms, food security for millions is at risk (and East Africa has 19 million people are already food insecure)[2]. From the BBC:\n\nThe East African region could be on the verge of a food crisis if huge swarms of locusts devouring crops and pasture are not brought under control, a top UN official has told the BBC. A massive food assistance may be required, Dominique Burgeon, director of emergencies for the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), said. Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are affected. There are fears that the locusts – already in the hundreds of billions – will multiply further. The FAO says the insects are breeding so fast that numbers could grow 500 times by June.\n\nFrom the Guardian:\n\nThe desert locust is considered the world’s most destructive migratory pest. A single locust can travel 150km and eat its own weight in food – about two grams – each day. A swarm the size of New York City can consume the same amount of food in one day as the total population of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. What we are seeing in East Africa today is unlike anything we’ve seen in a very long time. Its destructive potential is enormous, and it’s taking place in a region where farmers need every gram of food to feed themselves and their families. Most of the countries hardest hit are those where millions of people are already vulnerable or in serious humanitarian need, as they endure the impact of violence, drought, and floods. We have acted quickly to respond to this upsurge. Local and national governments in East Africa are leading the response, and our respective offices are working closely together to keep this outbreak under control. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has released $10 million from its Central Emergency Relief Fund to fund a huge scale-up in aerial operations to manage the outbreak. The FAO is urgently seeking $76 million from donors and other organisations to help the affected countries fight the outbreak. The amount required is likely to increase as the locusts spread.\n\n$76 million doesn’t seem like a lot (reminding me of the world’s collective failure to fund the development of vaccines for, e.g., COVID-19). Particularly since the Return On Investment, if that’s how you want to think about it, is enormous. From the Associated Press:\n\nMajor locust outbreaks can be devastating. One between 2003 and 2005 cost more than $500 million to control across 20 countries in northern Africa, the FAO has said. It caused more than $2.5 billion in harvest losses.\n\nSo we’ve seen how swarms of gregarious locusts originate, and their effects. But what triggers the swarms? Environmental effects. For example, climate change. The National Geographic has a fine explanation that includes this map:\n\n(Click through for a larger version.) They explain:\n\nExperts say a prolonged bout of exceptionally wet weather, including several rare cyclones that struck eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula over the last 18 months, are the primary culprit. The recent storminess, in turn, is related to the the Indian Ocean Dipole, an ocean temperature gradient that was recently extremely pronounced, something that’s also been linked to the devastating bushfires in eastern Australia. Unfortunately, some experts say it may be a harbinger of things to come as rising sea surface temperatures supercharge storms and climate change tips the scales in favor of circulation patterns like the one that set the stage for this year’s trans-oceanic disasters. “If we see this continued increase in the frequency of cyclones,” says Keith Cressman, senior locust forecasting officer with the Food and Agriculture Organization, “I think we can assume there will be more locust outbreaks and upsurges in the Horn of Africa.” According to Cressman, the desert locust crisis traces back to May 2018, when Cyclone Mekunu passed over a vast, unpopulated desert on the southern Arabian Peninsula known as the Empty Quarter, filling the space between sand dunes with ephemeral lakes. Because desert locusts breed and reproduce freely in the area, this likely gave rise to the initial wave. Then, in October, Cyclone Luban spawned in the central Arabian Sea, marched westward, and rained out over the same region near the border of Yemen and Oman. Then the locusts started to migrate. By the summer of 2019, swarms were leapfrogging over the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden into Ethiopia and Somalia, where they enjoyed another bout of successful breeding in subsequent months, Cressman says. This might have been as far as the locusts got were it not for the fact that last October, East Africa experienced unusually widespread and intense autumn rains, which were capped in December by a rare late season cyclone that made landfall in Somalia. These events triggered yet another reproductive spasm.\n\nAnd if I wanted to control the outbreak — insecticides do work against locusts — then having the locusts make landfall in Somalia is not what I would have chosen. Because Somalia is a failed state:\n\nSmall and wingless, the hopping young locusts are the next wave in the outbreak that threatens more than 10 million people across the region with a severe hunger crisis. And they are growing up in one of the most inaccessible places on the planet. Large parts of Somalia south of this semi-autonomous Puntland region are under threat, or held by, the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group. That makes it difficult or impossible to conduct the aerial spraying of the locusts that experts say is the only effective control.\n\n(Of course, states can fail in any number of ways, as we have seen recently in China.)\n\nIn past posts, I would point to or recommend some form of mobilization to prevent or mitigate environmental disaster; but there doesn’t seem to be a way to mobilize against locusts, except at the state level (or, I suppose, God level). Kenyan farmers, for example, are attempting to scare the locusts away with loud noises, like drumming or shouting. These measures seem unlikely to be effective. I can only hope that the donor class stumps up, and FAO gets its $76 million.[3]\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] I previously cross-posted on locusts in East Africa, but found the lack of detail very frustrating, so this post tries to remedy that.\n\n[2] There is little information on long-run, life-long effects of locust invasions, although educational attainment of children is affected.\n\n[3] I believe that locusts stop swarming when the weather cools. But that’s a long way away."

(File)\n\nPersisting differences on sticky issues — including Washington’s demand for greater access to agriculture, dairy and ICT products, have cast a shadow over the prospect of a limited trade deal being signed during US President Donald Trump’s two-day visit to the country, starting February 24.\n\nFresh speculations about disagreements have gathered pace, as US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who was widely expected to come before Trump to finalise the broad contours of the deal, hasn’t landed here yet, with no clarity on his arrival.\n\nImportantly, the US last week reportedly changed a key exemption to its trade remedy laws to make it easier to penalise several developing countries, including India and China, in the latest move to underscore its anxieties over New Delhi’s trade policies.\n\nWhile the quantum of incentives involved in the deal is unclear, it was initially expected to cover products with a total bilateral trade of over $10 billion. The limited deal was supposed to be signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in September last year but a lack of consensus had then stalled it.\n\nBoth the countries haven’t yet reached a consensus on the US demand that India scrap an up to 20 per cent duty on seven ICT products, including mobile phones worth over Rs 10,000 and smart watches. Nevertheless, India has strived to narrow the stark differences through hard negotiations over the months.\n\nNew Delhi has already conveyed that while an across-the-board cut of import duties on the seven items would cost it a massive $3.2 billion a year and help only third parties (like China and Korea) that supply more, it is willing to lower duties on those ICT products where it would benefit the US. The US made up for only 2 per cent of the Indian imports of the seven products in FY18.\n\nAs part of the initial deal, India is learnt to have agreed to sweeten its offer on the price control regime for medical devices and apply trade margin on coronary stents and knee implants at the first point of sale (price to stockiest), instead of imposing it on the landed prices, as was planned earlier.\n\nLast month, Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal had held a meeting with Lighthizer in Davos, where both are learnt to have discussed the deal.\n\nFor its part, India is pitching for an exemption from the extra duty imposed by the US on steel (25 per cent) and aluminium (10 per cent) and a complete restoration of duty-free export benefits for some Indian goods under the Generalised System of Preferences.

If she leaves the field in the middle of the day she is dismissed from work and left unpaid. In most cases, women working in the agriculture fields are paid starvation wages despite the fact that their work involves long hours and intense labour.\n\nTake the story of Marvi, an agricultural worker, who lives in the Matiari district of Sindh. She works 12 hours a day and earns just Rs100, which is far less than the minimum wage set by the Government of Sindh. During work, if she gets sick she cannot take time off, forget about maternity leave.\n\nSuch a story is all too familiar in the rural areas of Pakistan where women are more severely affected by poverty, malnutrition and under representation in the decision making process as compared to men. Even though women in Pakistan’s rural areas constitute the majority of the agriculture labour force in minimal and subsistence farming, their labour is not recognised as “work” by the formal and informal institutions, thus resulting in the marginalisation of women in their political, social and economic lives. More so, feudal landowners deliberately promote agricultural labour exploitation and patriarchal oppression of female agriculture workers.\n\nKeeping in view the extreme marginalisation and poverty of women in rural Sindh, the European Union funded and initiated the Sindh Union Council and Community Economic Strengthening Support (SUCCESS) programme in 2016. This aims to reduce poverty of 700,000 rural households by empowering women through various interventions including organising women-led community institutions, equipping them with vocational, leadership, and management skills, providing access to capital and formal financial institutions and forums to present their voice and communities in the decision making process and development undertaken for them.\n\nA study on women empowerment through the SUCCESS programme interventions showed that it improved political interactions by creating awareness of rural women’s demands and needs, then boosting their confidence as active citizens who should adopt a participatory development approach when interacting with public departments, and lastly, assisted them to knock at the right doors.\n\nThese political interactions channeled through Joint Development Committees formed at the tehsil and district level represented by women from the community institutions, representatives of local government, politicians, social workers and government officials, provided them the opportunity to advocate for their social and economic rights.\n\nAs a result, the Government of Sindh passed and ratified the Sindh Women Agriculture Workers Bill in 2019, under which women workers in agriculture, livestock, fisheries or other agro-based industries were given rights and benefits. The bill ensured their participation in decision making and eliminated discrimination. With this legislation, Sindh became the first province to take such a decision in South Asia.\n\nThe approved bill promotes and protects women’s rights, ensures their participation in decision making, eight hours’ work, written contracts and wages to not be less than the minimum wage fixed by the government, 120 days of maternity and Iddat leave, a harassment-free work environment, equal wage. It also gives them the right to form unions or to associate themselves with an association, access government agricultural, livestock, fisheries and other services, credit, social security, subsidies and asset transfers in their own rights or in association with other women agriculture workers, and the registration of workers at the union council level.\n\nThe polity of Sindh has shown a great vision by taking the first step towards the protection of women agriculture workers through the ratification of the Sindh Women Agriculture Workers Bill. Implementing this will require certain concerted measures such as strengthening synergies among community institutions, workers organisations, local government authorities and other departments of the government, to build upon and ensure women agriculture workers’ rights and benefits. This will in turn play a significant role in the empowerment of rural women and minding the gender gaps.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 16th, 2020.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\nRead full story"

Abdussamad Dasuki said this would be achieved through a multi-faceted approach.\n\nDasuki said the state government was embarking on the massive infrastructure development to make Sokoto an investment destination.\n\nThe Commissioner said the proposed N65.7 billion loan earmarked for critical projects in agriculture, health, housing, water resources and education, would fast track the economic transformation of the state and position Sokoto as a leading economy in Nigeria and Africa.\n\nNoting that central to the objectives of the Governor Tambuwal administration is human capital development, remodelling of the state into an investment destination, and establishment of enduring socio-economic infrastructure and institutions, the commissioner stated that the efforts of the government were already yielding fruits.\n\n“Our efforts to transform the economy by making the environment private sector driven are already yielding many fruits among which include the attraction of the biggest fertilizer blending company in the world to Sokoto and the biggest rice mill by Alhaji Aliko Dangote.\n\n“In addition, we are advancing the ease of doing business in the state by making it easier for established business to scale and enabling new ones to spring up,” Dasuki said.\n\nAccording to him, this would, in turn, translate to empowering families in the state and the effects would trickle down to everyone.\n\n“We have witnessed rapid growth of business enterprises as more organisations now have the capacity to meet more market needs, resulting in increased revenue and a more prosperous economy,” he said.\n\nDasuki also said that Governor Tambuwal administration had reformed the Payroll Systems which had removed ghost workers and helped Sokoto to implement the new minimum wage of N30,000 for workers in the civil service.\n\nSpeaking further, Dasuki said, “As a government, we believe it is important to invest in the education of our people. It is the greatest investment we can make towards the attainment of a more prosperous future. For this, posterity would be grateful to us. In this light, we have continued the renovation of secondary schools across the state. Already more than 100 secondary schools have been remodelled and renovated. Recently, we completed an ultra-modern secondary school in Gudu LGA, which was previously the only local government in Nigeria with no secondary.\n\nDasuki added that: “the Tambuwal administration has gone far in a social intervention program in which N4 billion has been set aside for distribution to indigenes of the state to enable them engage in and enhance any business of their choice.\n\n” In that regard, each and every indigene so selected got N 20,000 each. So far, the disbursement has been done in 9 out of the 23 local government areas of the state,” Dasuki noted.\n\nVanguard Nigeria News\n\nKindly Share This Story:"

            "content": "From our Obsession\n\nClimate Consciousness\n\nEvery decision counts.\n\nIt was his love for nature and wildlife that led Aditya Singh to quit his Indian civil services job, leave his well-appointed house in Delhi and settle in a remote corner of Rajasthan, abutting the famous Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, in 1998. Over the last 20 years, Singh has been buying tracts of land adjacent to Ranthambore and simply letting the forest grow back.\n\nAfter shifting to Sawai Madhopur, a small city near Ranthambore tiger reserve (RTR), Singh took up photography. His wife Poonam Singh and he opened a tourist resort there to earn their living. Unlike many tourism establishments that want unrestricted access to the wild areas, they slowly started buying land parcels adjacent to each other just outside RTR’s boundary.\n\n“The area is called Bhadlav. I had first gone to this area soon after settling in Ranthambore along with a BBC filmmaker. This area adjacent to the boundary of the Ranthambore reserve was visited by predators like tigers who used to come for prey. As a result, farmers were selling their land,” said Singh.\n\nPoonam remembers how it was love at first sight for her when she visited Ranthambore with Aditya. “My first sighting was a tigress with three cubs on a hill. It was magical. At the end of the trip, I just asked him if we can move to Ranthambore. He wanted it, too, and within months we moved. As far as this land is concerned, it was a dream that we both saw and achieved together to have our own area of wilderness,” she says. Poonam, an artist by profession, managed the resort with Aditya for twenty years until they closed it down in 2019.\n\nThey now own about 35 acres of land in Bhadlav, another five acres a few hundred metres away and a strip of land connecting the two.\n\n“I just bought this and did nothing to it except removing the invasive species. We allowed the land to recover and now after 20 years it has become a lush green patch of forest which is frequently visited by all kind of animals, including tigers, leopards and wild boars, throughout the year,” said Singh.\n\nIn an aerial shot he had captured, Singh points to their land parcel—a lush green expanse compared to the barren land of the Ranthambore tiger reserve with which his landholding shares the boundary. He has also created several water holes in the landholding to ensure that the wild animals get water even during summers.\n\nAditya Singh An aerial view of the land transformed by the Singhs.\n\nAs a result, the pressure of predators like tigers from RTR venturing into fields of farmers has gone down. “It is simply because the animals understand that in this patch of the forest they get prey, water and safe shelter without any disturbance,” chuckled Singh.\n\nAt present, India has 50 tiger reserves. Ranthambore is among the country’s biggest and most famous tiger reserves, with an estimated population of about 60 tigers.\n\nSingh admitted that he is often subjected to questions for not carrying out any project on his land which is now well worth over Rs1 crore ($140,000) despite getting so many proposals.\n\n“Money was never the consideration. It is just about my love for nature and wildlife. Instead, these days I am getting queries from people across India who want to replicate a similar model in their state,” he said.\n\nMAYANK AGGARWAL Aditya Singh\n\nThe Singhs are not done with this dream. Singh says he wants to buy more land adjacent to his fields, especially the agriculture field next to his land and inspire others in the area to follow suit.\n\nThe couple’s side project, a new home and homestay that’s in progress, is going to run on solar and wind power where too they are creating two small water holes on the fence of the house so that thirsty animals can get water during summers.\n\nThis post first appeared on Mongabay-India.

We are trying step by step, move forward and no particular timeline given,\" she said when asked if there is any timeframe for removing all income tax exemptions.\n\nAddressing a post-budget press conference on February 1, Sitharaman had said the government intended to remove all I-T exemptions in the long run.\n\nOn Sunday, she said that based on a simulation and assumption, 69 per cent of taxpayers would have benefitted and probably 11 per cent would have been \"attracted\" had the new tax regime been introduced last year.\n\nWhen asked about the Supreme Court order on telcos' payment of dues and the concerns expressed by some bankers, Sitharaman said it may not be proper for her to comment on the matter as there is a Ministry concerned looking into it.\n\n\"The concerned Ministry is looking into it. So, it may not be proper for me to comment on it\" she added.\n\nTo a query on allegations by the Telangana government that there was a decline in devolution of funds to states from the Centre, she said the allocation is followed as per the recommendations of the Finance commissions and it is not true that the centre is not cooperating with states."

You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then we had 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs. At one point, 98 percent of the world worked in agriculture; today it's 2 percent in the United States.\n\n\n\nNow comes the information economy. And the information economy is fundamentally different because it's built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter.\n\nIn response, Bloomberg was condemned by the left and right.\n\nPeople for Bernie, the official Twitter account for Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters, said, \"Time and time again we see Bloomberg insulting the middle class and the working class...\"\n\nNew York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof said, \"Hm. And farmers in Oregon can teach anyone to be a financier...\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr. said, \"Bloomberg wouldn't last 3 seconds as a farmer... but like his comments on minorities, you can tell he really hates regular hardworking Americans.\"\n\nJournalist Selana Zito pointed out that farming, in fact, requires a significant amount of technology and advanced intelligence to be successful.\n\n\"This 'can teach anyone' quip is ignorant. Farmers are electricians plumbers, mechanics, scientists, vets, engineers & H2O/soil conservationists; they take care of the crops that fill our cupboards & care for the animals who provide dairy & meat for our feasts. But Ok GreyMatter,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, popular Twitter user David Burge simply mocked Bloomberg in response, quipping, \"I guess he's so short because somebody forgot to water him.\"\n\nBloomberg, who has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on his campaign, has surged to third place in the Democratic race, according to RealClearPolitics."

The Central government will provide subsidies and support systems for the FPOs, Mr. Anandakumar explained. “The farmers in FPOs will also be trained under government programmes, which will increase the quality of the produce,” he said.\n\nFollowing the meeting, steps to set up an FPO in Pollachi will be undertaken as per the guidelines of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development , he said."

Farming is difficult, and it requires a great deal of gray matter, and always has. Evaluating soils and weather and making decisions about what to plant and when is hard enough, but it also requires sound economic judgment, which you’d think Bloomberg would appreciate. Farming is a sophisticated enterprise, far more than some yokel digging a hole and putting a seed in.\n\nTrump has screwed over farmers throughout his reign, and we could count on at least some of them defecting to the Democrats, at least as long as we don’t nominate Bloomberg. Is there any portion of the electorate that wants that guy, other than the billionaires and Wall Street bankers?"

            "content": "Deals and discounts abound online and in stores, but too many people are overspending in a number of categories. They blindly pay for certain items without considering lower-cost options.\n\nAnd it's not just one-off outlays. Folks are splurging on entertainment on a monthly basis. They're throwing hundreds of dollars away yearly on cable TV, dining out, and caffeinated beverages, to name a few areas.\n\nBut they don't have to. Here's why.\n\nConsumers pay a lot in cable fees\n\nAccording to Statista, 34% of U.S. consumers pay anywhere from $50 to $100 a month on cable TV.\n\nMany pay even more than that thanks to unexpected charges. In a recent study, Consumer Reports found that consumers pay $450 in fees each year, which amounts to $28 billion annually going to cable companies. In fact, 64% of U.S. consumers are paying more in fees than they did five years ago, according to Consumer Reports.\n\nYou can fight back by cutting the cord. From Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Disney+, there are many streaming content services that don't tack on fees and aren't as costly. Disney+ is $6.99 per month, while Netflix's most expensive plan comes in at $15.99 per month. Disney+ customers who also want Hulu and ESPN+ pay $12.99 per month. Subscribing to multiple streaming services can still be cheaper than cable.\n\nFor those resistant to cutting the cord, there are other ways to save. The cable industry is cutthroat and market share is the name of the game. Providers don't want to lose your business and will go to great lengths to keep you as a customer. With the upper hand, you can negotiate a lower bill and/or request that fees be waived. You may not get 100% of what you want, but you should save something. If you have multiple providers in your area, take the time to shop around, too, comparing rates and fees.\n\nDining out is getting pricier\n\nFood prices are on the rise; the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts they'll jump between 1.5% and 2.5% this year. In 2019, the cost of food increased by 1.8%. Restaurant prices saw the biggest jump, rising 3.1% year over year in 2019. More of the same is expected this year, with supermarket prices holding steady but the cost of dining out on an upward trajectory.\n\nThe easiest way to save money on dining out is to do it less often, and hit the grocery store instead. But if you're among the millions of U.S. consumers who collectively spend billions of dollars in restaurants, there are ways to save.\n\nTiming is everything when it comes to going out to eat. Most people don't go to dinner at 5 p.m., but it's a great way to save. Lots of restaurants offer early-bird specials, shaving serious cash off the bill. An added bonus: You get to beat the rush. Specials on certain days of the week are also common, so take notice. The food is just as good on a Tuesday night as it is on Saturday.\n\nLoyalty also pays. If you follow your favorite eateries on social media and sign up for their email lists, you'll land deals and discounts. Many restaurant chains have mobile apps that enable you to accumulate points on purchases. Skipping the drinks, appetizers, and dessert can also make eating out more affordable.\n\nCaffeine expenditures are high\n\nThe coffee industry made $85 billion last year, an increase of 4.2% from the previous year. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) controls 40% of the coffee-shop market, bringing in $26.5 billion in revenue in 2019 alone. Caffeine-loving consumers are clearly spending some serious cash on their habit. But that doesn't mean they should have to pay full price.\n\nThe cheapest way is to brew your drinks yourself. If you're a coffee or tea connoisseur, that may require a little upfront investment, but once your brewing is up to your standards, it can save you a small fortune over the year. Let's say you spend $25 a week on coffee: That's $1,300 a year. Even with a $500 investment to get a top-of-the-line coffee maker, you'd save a nice chunk of change. If tea is more your speed, a $5 box of tea bags is an affordable way to treat yourself.\n\nIf DIY-ing your caffeine fix isn't for you, consider shopping around for the best deal. Starbucks may be the most convenient option, but a local coffee shop or convenience store may brew up a decent cup of coffee for much cheaper.\n\nIf you do stick to your current purveyors, make sure to sign up to their loyalty programs and use their mobile apps. Searching for online discounts, and purchasing unwanted gift cards on the cheap, can also yield you savings.\n\nLife is expensive, but your entertainment doesn't have to be. Follow the above tips and you can break the habit of overspending for life's little luxuries."

            "content": "Ask Sean Stanford what it's like to be a farmer in southern Alberta during the winter, and one of the first things he talks about is his mental health.\n\n\"It's when a lot of thoughts go sideways in your head, it seems like to me,\" he says.\n\nStanford, 35, runs a grain farm near the town of McGrath, south of Lethbridge.\n\n\"Winter is definitely tough, especially out here in the prairies, because there's snow and cold and not a lot of people around,\" he says.\n\nStanford is a third-generation farmer — his parents and grandparents, on both sides of the family, work the land within 20 kilometres of where he lives today.\n\n\"It's kind of a family heritage thing for all of us to be farmers,\" he says.\n\nSean Stanford likens farming to high-stakes gambling. 'It's like going to Vegas and betting thousands per roll.' (Nick Purdon/CBC)\n\nStill, despite the inevitability of following in the family footsteps, there's something unique about Stanford. He's one of the first farmers in Canada to speak publicly about his mental health struggles.\n\n\"If I hadn't gotten help, I don't know if I would be here today, honestly,\" he says.\n\n\"I am not saying I am a suicidal person necessarily, but you start to get to some dark places when you don't know what's going on inside of yourself.\"\n\nStanford is by no means alone.\n\nA 2016 study from the University of Guelph polled 1,100 Canadian farmers across the country and found that roughly 45 per cent had high levels of stress, and 35 per cent met the criteria for depression — numbers that are much higher than the general population.\n\n'It's a high-dollar risk game'\n\nOne of the primary mental health stress factors that comes with farming is financial.\n\nIn order to purchase the land and equipment they need, many farmers have to juggle high levels of debt. Meanwhile, their payoff depends on the weather.\n\n\"You try to do everything right and you have no idea what's gonna happen,\" Stanford says. \"Something is going to fall out of the sky — if it's rain it'll be good, if it's hail it could be bad. It's a high-dollar risk game.\n\n\"It's like going to Vegas and betting thousands per roll. You never know what the outcome is gonna be.\"\n\nThe sun sets on a field near Saskatoon. A recent study of 1,100 Canadian farmers found that roughly 45 per cent had high levels of stress, and 35 per cent met the criteria for depression. (Nick Purdon/CBC)\n\nA few years ago that unpredictability hit Stanford hard.\n\nHis crops weren't very good, the bills were piling up and he had more work than he could handle. Stanford says he tried to keep going, but in the end he broke down.\n\n\"I was in bed and it felt like a crushing weight on my chest and my arm. It felt like every sign of a heart attack that I have ever read before,\" he says.\n\n\"I thought I was going to die. I thought: 'my family is gonna be without me and they are gonna be in even worse shape.' Until I finally got the answer of what was wrong it was petrifying.\"\n\nWhen a doctor said what Stanford believed was a heart attack was in fact anxiety, it created another problem.\n\nFarmers can talk about a heart attack, but to admit that you suffer from anxiety is taboo, Stanford explains.\n\n\"Farmers are supposed to be the salt of the earth, strong people who don't need help from anybody. They are supposed to carry on no matter what happens to them,\" he says.\n\n\"But I have come to realize that asking for help is not a bad thing.\"\n\nFarmers need to 'do more'\n\nWhen Stanford reached out online for help he found Leslie Kelly, who runs a grain farm near Saskatoon with her husband Matt.\n\nKelly had recently co-founded the first Canadian mental health organization aimed specifically at farmers, called Do More Agriculture .\n\n\"In agriculture we always hear about the latest advances in technology and innovation, and we forgot about our people,\" Kelly says.\n\nLeslie Kelly's Do More Foundation recently received non-profit status and launched a project where they fund mental health first aid training in a dozen rural communities across Canada. (Nick Purdon/CBC)\n\nWhile Kelly sensed that many farmers struggled with their mental health, it wasn't until she rented a hall in Edmonton and invited people to come and talk about it that she understood the full extent of the problem.\n\n\"There were about 400 seats in that room and I thought, 'oh if a dozen people come that will be so great.' And when we opened the doors, the farmers they flooded in, and you could not find an empty chair in that room,\" Kelly says.\n\n\"People were even sitting in the aisle and standing along the back. We asked the question if you knew someone who has died by suicide — a loved one, a community member, a fellow farmer — and almost that whole entire room stood up. And I cried almost that whole panel.\"\n\nThen when the event was over, Kelly met someone who showed her just how much she could help.\n\n\"There was a farmer who was directly across from me, he was standing at the back and he had his hat down, and he cried the whole time,\" she says.\n\n\"He came up to us when everybody had left and he said, 'I'd like to thank you.' We said why? He said 'you just saved my life. I am going to go home and talk to my wife.'\n\n\"I cried, knowing that we should've been talking about this years ago.\"\n\nWhen farmer and mental health activist Leslie Kelly asked a simple question to a gathering of 400 farmers at a meeting in Edmonton, the full extent of the mental health problem in the community hit home. 0:37\n\n'He thought he was dying'\n\nThe reason that story hits home for Kelly is the same reason she started working to help farmers with their mental health in the first place. Her husband Matt had his own mental health breakdown a few years ago during a particularly tough harvest.\n\n\"Everything was starting to compound — my life, the farm, everything was just starting to balloon. And I was just going around and around in a circle,\" Matt Kelly remembers.\n\n\"I started to have panic attacks at night. I would think about one thing. One thing would turn into 10. Ten things would turn into 100, would turn into 1,000 and so on.\"\n\nMatt Kelly says he was having trouble dealing with the stress of running his farm. 'Everything was starting to compound - my life, the farm, everything was just starting to balloon.' (Nick Purdon/CBC)\n\nLeslie Kelly explains that watching her husband's panic attacks was the hardest thing she's ever done.\n\n\"He thought he was dying. He would sweat and not be able to breathe, and I would have to hold onto him so tight for him to focus on my breathing to get it to slow down,\" she says.\n\n\"I remember having to take his clothes off because he was sweating so much, and laying him down on the cool floor to get him to cool off.\"\n\nToday, with Leslie's help, Matt is doing much better. And now the couple works together promoting mental health for farmers across the country.\n\nIf you're experiencing suicidal thoughts or having a mental health crisis, help is available across Canada. For an emergency or crisis situation, call 911.\n\nThe Do More Foundation recently received non-profit status and launched a project where they fund mental health first aid training in a dozen rural communities across Canada.\n\nAnd last spring Leslie Kelly testified at a House of Commons standing committee looking into the mental health challenges facing Canadian farmers.\n\nMatt Kelly runs a grain farm near Saskatoon and has struggled with panic attacks due to stress. He now promotes mental health awareness among farmers across Canada. (Nick Purdon/CBC)\n\nA 'real farmer' would just suck it up\n\nSean Stanford tries to help other farmers too.\n\nHe knows what it takes to get healthy, and shares his experience whenever he can.\n\n\"Most days I feel something, a little bit of stress of some kind, but I found a lot of mechanisms to help me with it,\" he says.\n\n\"I am on some medications that I take every day. It really helped level me out. Before, I would get home, have supper, go back to work. Now I stay and play with the kids, and have more quality time to help my brain decompress after a day of work.\"\n\nAlberta grain farmer Sean Stanford describes his mental health breakdown. 0:12\n\nStanford's journey hasn't been easy. The stigma around mental health still exists. He says he gets messages online telling him that a \"real farmer\" would just suck it up.\n\nBut Stanford says he tried that, and the stakes are too high.\n\n\"What I was doing wasn't working, something needed to change. I am glad getting help was what the change was, rather than abandoning the farm, abandoning my family, abandoning everything I've known,\" he says.\n\n\"It was the right choice to get help, so I can continue everything I have been working on my whole life rather than change directions and run away.\"\n\nWATCH | The National's feature on encouraging farmers to speak up about stress and depression:"

There’s always a little excitement — at no extra cost. Except we have a lot of water on the stage,” he said as he returned to the stage.\n\nThe protesters were prompted by the senator’s support in 2018 for legislation that provided emergency financial support for dairy farmers across the country because of the falling price of milk.\n\nIt’s not the first time a Sanders rally has been disrupted by a topless protester: A woman showed up at a March 2016 rally in Arizona with the words “Stop Fascism” on her back and “Hate speech is not free” on her front.\n\nDe Blasio announced his support for Sanders this weekend after backing Hillary Clinton in 2016."

And that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter,” he said. –Washington Times\n\nBillionaire Bloomberg claims he \"could teach anybody to be a farmer,\" even implying that farmers don't have the same level of \"skillset\" or \"grey matter\" as folks in tech jobs. So demeaning, elitist, and out-of-touch it's appalling. pic.twitter.com/Auplmdq56m — Anna Kelly (@AnnaKellyWI) February 17, 2020\n\nBloomberg is also making strides with elderly voters with his casual ‘death panel’ banter.\n\nBloomberg explaining how healthcare will “bankrupt us,” unless we deny care to the elderly. “If you show up with cancer & you’re 95 years old, we should say…there’s no cure, we can’t do anything.

(Express Photo/ Jaipal Singh) CM Manohar Lal Khattar on his way to attend pre-Budget meeting in Panchkula. (Express Photo/ Jaipal Singh)\n\nDays before presenting his maiden budget, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday had a pre-Budget meeting with MLAs and sought their suggestions on various subjects, including agriculture and education, to incorporate them in the Budget. In the BJP-JJP coalition government, Khattar has kept the Finance Department portfolio with himself.\n\nThe Budget Session of the Haryana Assembly begins on February 20 and the three-day pre-budget meeting with MLAs in Panchkula is aimed at getting feedbacks and suggestions from them.\n\nPrior to this, Khattar has already held meetings with MPs from the state, besides experts from various sectors, including service sector, real estate, industry, and agriculture. He also met farmers, women, entrepreneurs among others. The meet with legislators is the last one in the series.\n\nTalking to reporters after meeting legislators in Panchkula, Khattar described the state government’s pre-budget consultations with different stakeholders “as a historical step in the democratic system of the country”. He said Haryana is probably is the first state in the country where the Budget is being finalized with participation of all On the occasion, MLAs from the ruling BJP and JJP besides those of the Congress and independents gave their suggestions on different topics including agriculture, animal husbandry, school education, higher education, skill development and technical education.\n\nSenior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who held a meeting with his party legislators in the morning to firm up suggestions to be given, however, could not attend the meeting with Khattar as he had to rush to Nuh due to the death of former Haryana minister Chaudhary Khurshid Ahmed.\n\nINLD’s lone MLA Abhay Singh Chautala rued that not more than two minutes were given to the MLAs to speak and put forth their suggestions, which he said defeated the purpose of the chief minister’s pre-budget meeting exercise.\n\nKhattar said the MLAs have given their suggestions by rising above the party lines and he assured them that all their viable suggestions would be incorporated in the state Budget for 2020-21.\n\nhe also responded to concerns raised by Abhay Chautala, who dubbed the entire exercise as a “mere formality” saying suggestions were now being sought at the fag end.\n\nKhattar assured that suggestions given by public representatives in six sessions during the three-day discussion would be given due importance in the upcoming budget. He exhorted the opposition parties not to politicise this issue. Khattar said he had also asked the MLAs to suggest the sources of revenue as well while recommending new schemes. He said in the last five years, the state government has worked to meet all basic requirements like food, shelter, clothing, water, electricity, education and security for the people of the state.\n\n“As many as 38 MLAs gave 71 suggestions today.. this will be the people’s budget and I am happy to say this that all MLAs, irrespective of their party affiliations, gave good suggestions,” he said.\n\nChautala later told reporters that Haryana is primarily an agrarian state and legislators should have been given enough time on the topic. He saw slim chances of suggestions being incorporated in the budget and dubbed the entire exercise a “mere formality”.\n\n“This exercise seems to be aimed at only ensuring newspaper headlines. If the government was keen in seeking our views, this exercise should have been conducted two months before the budget session. How will the officers who are giving final shape to the budget now incorporate so many suggestions at last minute,” he asked.\n\nKhattar, however, said, “We had allotted five minutes to each MLA to speak. If the time limit is kept indefinite, in that case we may get to hear speeches while suggestions may not necessarily come. I don’t think barring one MLA (Abhay Chautala) anyone complained.”\n\nCongress MLA Geeta Bhukkal, who was Education Minister in the previous Congress regime, said she was given extra 10 minutes to speak as the government sought suggestions from her in detail in the education sector.\n\nBhukkal said she pointed out to the government that as it was bound to implement the Fundamental Right to Education and impart education to children from class one to eight free of cost, the government should also start pre-nursery classes in government schools and open play schools. “On agriculture, my suggestion was that many women are engaged in this sector, therefore, a Mahila Kisan Cell should be set up,” she said.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "content": "Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) national president H.D. Deve Gowda has accused the BJP government in the State of indulging in vendetta politics by cancelling most of the development works sanctioned by the JD(S)-Congress coalition government.\n\nAddressing presspersons here on Sunday, he said that on the one hand the BJP leaders were talking about not indulging in vendetta politics, but on the other they were missing no opportunity to trouble the Opposition party workers. Withdrawal of projects and grants sanctioned by the previous government had hindered development activities in many areas. This apart, the JD(S) workers were being harassed and assaulted by using police force, he alleged, referring to an incident where a JD(S) leader was allegedly threatened by the police.\n\nHe said he would fight against any such high-handedness against the Opposition members.\n\nMr. Gowda said he was not deterred by the debacle in the Parliamentary elections and added that he would take all possible steps to strengthen the party network and instil confidence among the workers by touring the State. Alongside, efforts would be made to expand the party network in Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh, where it had presence, he said.\n\nAbout the future course of action, he said: “My immediate priority is to prepare the party to face the upcoming Assembly and Parliamentary elections, which are likely to be held simultaneously in 2023.”\n\nMr. Gowda ruled out any alliance with the Congress and said he had declined the offer by senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on holding fresh talks. Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has openly said that poll alliance with the JD(S) had cost his party dearly. “Therefore, there is no scope for fresh alliance,” he said.\n\nHe said the Union Budget has failed to address issues concerning the farm sector. Allocation for the agriculture sector has been reduced by ₹1 lakh crore, he said.\n\nLater, Mr. Gowda called on veteran journalist Patil Puttappa who is undergoing treatment at KIMS."

To meet this demand, farmers and agricultural companies are turning to the Internet of Things (IoT) for analytics and greater production capabilities.\n\nThe IoT is set to push the future of farming to the next level. Smart agriculture is already becoming more commonplace among farmers, and high tech farming is quickly becoming the standard thanks to agricultural drones and sensors.\n\nFarmers have already begun employing some high tech farming techniques and technologies in order to improve the efficiency of their day-to-day work. For example, sensors placed in fields allow farmers to obtain detailed maps of both the topography and resources in the area, as well as variables such as acidity and temperature of the soil. They can also access climate forecasts to predict weather patterns in the coming days and weeks.\n\nFarmers can use their smartphones to remotely monitor their equipment, crops, and livestock, as well as obtain stats on their livestock feeding and produce. They can even use this technology to run statistical predictions for their crops and livestock.\n\nAnd drones have become an invaluable tool for farmers to survey their lands and generate crop data.\n\nAll of these techniques help make up precision farming or precision agriculture, the process of using satellite imagery and other technology (such as sensors) to observe and record data with the goal of improving production output while minimizing cost and preserving resources.\n\nThe rise of blockchain technology is making its way to the IoT, and could be important in the farming sector due to its ability to provide companies with important data on crops. Farmers can use sensors to gather data about crops, which is written onto blockchain, and includes identifying factors as well as salt and sugar content and pH levels.\n\nGiven all of the potential benefits of these IoT applications in agriculture, it’s understandable that farmers are increasingly turning to agricultural drones and satellites for the future of farming.\n\nRead the full report in Business Insider here, with details on the Internet of Things research report by Business Insider Intelligence\n\nShare this: Email\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nSkype\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\n"

Venkaiah Naidu today emphasizes the need for ethical corporate governance in Indian Industry.\n\nSpeaking at the centenary year celebrations of the Jamshedpur city, the Vice President said that some people took undue advantage of the system, and industry has a duty to eschew such elements.\n\nObserving that a company’s ethics, values, and social responsibility play an important role in building its reputation, Shri Naidu said that conducting business in an ethical manner builds confidence among customers and investors.\n\nHe appreciated the Tata Group for being synonymous with high ethical standards and the pioneering spirit of entrepreneurship.\n\nShri Naidu also called upon the industry to shed its hesitation to make investments to facilitate economic growth.\n\nCalling industry and agriculture as two eyes of nations, he opined that industry must compliment the efforts of government to achieve desired economic progress.\n\nDescribing Public-Private Partnership (PPPs) as one of the best models for development in a developing economy like India, the Vice President said that PPP models would lead to improved efficiency and faster delivery of services.\n\n“In my view, it is the best way forward to develop infrastructure and other projects that give a fillip to economic growth”, he said.\n\nReferring to the recent policy interventions of the Reserve Bank of India, Shri Naidu said the measures were aimed at lowering the cost of funds for banks and providing funds to the industry.\n\nHe said that loans to the automobile sector, residential housing and micro, small and medium enterprises have been kept outside the purview of the cash reserve ratio, which at present stands at four percent of banks’ deposits.\n\nPointing out that the Reserve Bank of India had projected a GDP growth rate of six percent for the financial year 2020-21 he said that investment outlook in the Indian economy has begun to show signs of improvement and the inflation pressure was likely to ease in the financial year 2020-21.\n\nCalling for incentivization of the wealth creation and increasing the ease of business, Shri Naidu cautioned against freebies. “Distribution without production will lead to ruin”, he said.\n\nStating that automation was expected to play a major role in the coming years and the workers of the future would have to be highly adaptable, the Vice President urged all business enterprises and manufacturing units to train and re-train their employees to face future challenges.\n\nShri Naidu opined that there was no dearth of talent in India, we only need to identify the talent and nurture it. Maintaining that this was not the responsibility for the governments alone, he called upon the industry to supplement the government’s efforts in skilling.\n\n“Bridging the skills gap among the workforce must become an essential component of every organization’s activities,” he said.\n\nObserving that a large part of our economic activity was dependent on agriculture and sectors allied with it, the Vice President opined that there was an urgent need for collective efforts to make agriculture profitable and sustainable.\n\nWhile appreciating the government for its efforts to increase farmer’s income, Shri Naidu urged the private sector to contribute by constructing cold storage facilities, providing transport facilities from villages to the nearby market yards as part of their CSR activity.\n\nStating that ensuring a viable, sustainable livelihood for those living in rural areas should the priority for all, the Vice President said that it would reduce the forced migration from rural areas.\n\nDescribing the climate change and terrorism as twin global challenges, Shri Naidu urged the world community should come together to tackle these challenges.\n\nInsisting on making the development sustainable, the Vice President said that the time has arrived for the private sector to increase its investments in new and renewable energy. “It will not only reduce the cost per unit considerably but would also reduce India’s dependence on fossil fuels,” he added.\n\nStating that there was no place for violence in a democracy, the Vice President called upon everyone to come out of the evil influence of violence. Ballot is always better than bullet, he highlighted.\n\nShri Naidu recalled the contributions and the legendary role of JRD Tata, in setting up India’s first steel plant at Jamshedpur and said that he was not only a doyen of the Indian industry, but also was a visionary leader who foresaw a rising India.\n\nAppreciating various sports facilities created in Jamshedpur, the Vice President called for greater focus on sports and fitness. He said Fit India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Yoga should become people’s movement.\n\nShri Naidu complimented all the citizens of Jamshedpur on the completion of 100 years of their city and wished that the city continues to be a role model for sustainable urban development.\n\nOn this occasion, the Vice President also visited the Center for Excellence and Tata Steel Archives in Jamshedpur wherein he was briefed upon the journey of hundred years Tata Steel.\n\nAfter the event at Tata Steel, the Vice President also visited the hundred year old Andhra Bhakta Sri Rama Mandiram, in Jamshedpur city and performed puja and interacted with devotees.\n\nGovernor of Jharkhand, Smt. Droupadi Murmu, Jharkhand Minister, Shri Champai Soren, Postmaster General of Jharkhand, Shri Anil Kumar, senior officials of Tata Steel and functionaries Workers’ Union were present on the occasion.\n\nFollowing is the full text of the speech –\n\n“It gives me A great pleasure to be amongst you in Jamshedpur today, which is India’s first planned industrial city that was set up on the confluence of the rivers Subarnarekha and Kharkai by the visionary industrialist Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata in the early years of the 20th Century.\n\nIt is befitting that the Government of India is releasing a postage stamp to commemorate the renaming of what was Sakchi to Jamshedpur in the year 1919 by the then Viceroy of India, Lord Chelmsford.\n\nI am delighted to release the stamp formally on the occasion of the celebration of 100 years of this model city.\n\nThe seeds of industrialization in India was sown here, when Jamsetji, along with geologist Charles Page Perin, chose this site to set up India’s first steel plant. Since then industrialization in India has come a long way and industry has been a significant contributor to the nation’s GDP.\n\nDear sisters and brothers,\n\nIt will be apt to recall the legendary role of JRD Tata, who was not only a doyen of the Indian industry, but also a visionary leader who foresaw a rising India. He guided the destiny of the Tata group for over half a century and led the empire by example. The Tata Group has been synonymous with high ethical standards and the pioneering spirit of entrepreneurship.\n\nThe great revolutionary leader, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was the President of Jamshedpur Labour Association from 1928 to 1937. He took over as President of the Labour Association at the behest of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi and when the company was facing unrest by laborers.\n\nThe unrest happened just at the start of the worldwide depression which was also a very difficult time for the company.\n\nNetaji worked towards an immediate settlement that was honorable and the harbinger of a long-term relationship between the labor and the management.\n\nMahatma Gandhi Ji had visited Jamshedpur in 1925 with the twin objectives of seeing India’s first steel city and resolving some labor problems that had arisen at that time.\n\nHe had said, “I wish this great Indian firm all the prosperity it deserves and to this great enterprise every success. And, may I hope that the relations between this great house and laborers who work under their care will be of the friendliest character”.\n\nDear sisters and brothers,\n\nAs you all are aware, the Government of India is focused on policy interventions that aim to ignite the spirit of entrepreneurship and enterprise in the country and provide a fillip to industrialization and economic growth. The ‘Make in India’ program is just one such initiative in this regard.\n\nEstimates suggest that the global population is expected to expand to 9.8 billion by 2050 and the industry requirements would be totally different from what we are seeing today. Automation is expected to play a major role in the coming years and the workers of the future would have to be highly adaptable. They would be probably required to do multiple roles instead of doing a single job in a mechanical fashion.\n\nGiven such a scenario, the industry, the government, and the civil society should join hands to train the future workforce.\n\nIn this technologically-driven era, it is important for all business enterprises and manufacturing units to train and retrain their employees to face future challenges.\n\nWe must remember that workforce development is directly linked to economic growth and that is why I urge all industry associations, firms and factories to lay special emphasis on training. Bridging the skills gap among the workforce must become an essential component of every organization’s activities.\n\nI am aware of the training and services are undertaken by the TATA group in various states. I compliment them for imparting students with adequate skills and for preparing them to join the workforce of tomorrow.\n\nOver the past few years, as well as in the recent budget, the Government of India has taken several proactive measures to facilitate ease of doing business. They include financial sector restructuring, reduction in corporate taxes, removing alternate tax in the new structure and scrapping the dividend distribution tax on corporate, among others.\n\nI am sure that the new personal tax regime will ensure more money in the hands of the people, and this is expected to revive consumer demand.\n\nDear sisters and brothers, a large part of our economic activity is dependent on farmers and sectors allied with it. There is a need for collective efforts to double the farmers’ income and ensure that agriculture becomes profitable and sustainable.\n\nWhile the government is doing its bit, the private sector too must chip in areas like constructing cold storage facilities and providing transport facilities from villages to the nearby market yards as part of their CSR activity.\n\nAs you are aware, Government spending alone cannot push the economic growth rate to levels that we wish to achieve. The industry which is one of the main drivers of the economy should shed its hesitation to make investments and facilitate economic growth.\n\nThe recent policy interventions of the Reserve Bank of India are aimed at lowering the cost of funds for banks and providing funds to the industry. Loans to the automobile sector, residential housing and micro, small and medium enterprises have been kept outside the purview of the cash reserve ratio, which at present stands at four percent of banks’ deposits.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has projected a GDP growth rate of six percent for the financial year 2020-21. It is said that the investment outlook in the Indian economy has begun to show signs of improvement and the inflation pressure is likely to ease in the financial year 2020-21. The three arms of India’s growth engine – private investment, private consumption, and exports – are expected to pave the way for the long-term economic growth of the country.\n\nI am also happy to note that an amount of Rs.1.7 lakh crore has been allocated for creation transport and infrastructure in the Union Budget for 2020-21. Besides generating demand in core sectors of the economy, this will go a long way in the creation of jobs, especially in the rural sector.\n\nI feel that Public-Private Partnership (PPPs) is one of the best models for development in a developing economy like India. In my view, it is the best way forward to develop infrastructure and other projects that give a fillip to economic growth. I am sure that PPP models would lead to improved efficiency and faster delivery of services.\n\nMy dear sisters and brothers,\n\nIt should be remembered that ethical corporate governance is the need of the hour.\n\nA strong foundation in ethical values should be the basis for exemplary corporate governance.\n\nA company’s ethics, values, and social responsibility play an important role in building its reputation. Conducting business in an ethical manner builds confidence among customers and investors.\n\nIndia with its inherent spiritual strength, rich traditions, and strong value systems-- which form the core of many family-run businesses—can emerge as a role model for other countries in corporate governance.\n\nThe practitioners of corporate governance should play a leading role in making India a global leader in their field. Therefore, it is important to adhere to values of honesty, integrity, truthfulness and adopt the best practices. Corporate ethics should not be violated. Here, I would like you to always remember the seven sins mentioned by Mahatma Gandhi—wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, religion without sacrifice and politics without principle.\n\nIn our quest for industrialization and economic development, we should not overlook the all-important issue of sustainability. The development of a sustainable strategy is increasingly becoming imperative for companies’ survival and longevity.\n\nThe industry must focus on energy efficiency and resource conservation to meet the needs of future generations. The industry must pay attention to safe and skill-enhancing working conditions, low waste production processes and the use of safe and environmentally-compatible materials.\n\nAll this becomes all the more important in the wake of climate change, which has become one of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century.\n\nDeveloping countries, with low adaptive capacities and high dependence on climate variables, are highly susceptible to climate-induced calamities. Among other things, we must focus on renewable energy sources to cut down on Carbon-dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Indian government has been taking several measures to achieve cleaner air.\n\nIn September 2019, the Prime Minister had launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) with its Secretariat in Delhi. This global partnership is the second such international initiative after the launch of the International Solar Alliance in 2015.\n\nThis global partnership will help in addressing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as also the aims of the Sendai Framework and Paris Climate Agreement. Perhaps it would be apt to recall what the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi had stated while announcing the global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), at the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 held in New York City in September 2019.\n\nHe had said : “What is needed today is a comprehensive approach that covers everything including education, values to lifestyle and development philosophies. What we need is a global people’s movement to bring about behavioral change; need, not greed is our guiding principal. So, therefore India is here today to present a practical approach and roadmap…In order to make our infrastructure resilient in the face of disasters, India is launching a Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. I invite all member states to join this Coalition.”\n\nA recent report by a renewable energy consultancy stated that India’s solar and wind generation is expected to touch 135 Giga Watts (GW) by the end of 2024, up from the 77 GW in 2019.\n\nTo reduce the number of thermal power plants that are old and have high carbon emission levels, the government has proposed that utilities running them would be advised to close them if they fail to meet new emission norms.\n\nI was informed that the government wants to encourage States that are formulating and implementing plans for ensuring cleaner air in cities above one million.\n\nWe all are aware, that the poor and people having low income bear the maximum brunt of the problems caused by the changing climate and global warming.\n\nKeeping this hard fact in mind, we all must explore ways to ensure a development that is both sustainable and resilient to climate change. The time has come for the private sector to increase its investments in new and renewable energy. It will not only reduce the cost per unit considerably but would also reduce India’s dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nWith rapid industrialization, we have another problem to grapple with, and that is the problem of rapid urbanization.\n\nThe scope of employment in cities, coupled with declining profitability from agricultural activity, is leading to migration from rural areas to the cities. Problems like housing, transportation, pollution, water shortage, and waste disposal will get accentuated in years to come. According to the World Bank, urban dwellers in India comprised 34 percent of the nation’s population in 2017. This is expected to go up to 40 percent by the year 2030.\n\nTo address the issue, the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs of the Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission in June 2015. The objective of the Smart Cities Mission is to promote sustainable and inclusive cities that provide core infrastructure and offer a decent quality of life to all its citizens.\n\nThe idea is to provide a clean and sustainable environment and facilitate the application of smart solutions.\n\nWe also need to focus on smart villages and enable the rural population to secure employment, education opportunities and healthcare facilities at the local level. We need to provide urban facilities in rural areas to prevent migration and strengthen rural economy.\n\nEnsuring a viable, sustainable livelihood for those living in rural areas should become a priority. India Inc. must think of contributing to rural prosperity by taking up projects that generate economic activities and employment.\n\ninsurance is an important aspect that workers tend to ignore. A proper insurance mechanism must be made available for them and at the same time, they should be encouraged to make good use of schemes such as Ayushman Bharat.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to compliment the citizens of Jamshedpur on the completion of 100 years of their city. And, as in the years gone by, I hope this city continues to be a role model for sustainable urban development.\n\nJAI HIND!”\n\n****\n\nVRRK/MS/RK"

Camila Rodríguez-Gómez\n\nColombian scientist Camila Rodriguez-Gomez is studying the clouds in the Valley of Mexico in hopes of finding clues to what influences them to form; how Mexico City’s emissions and nearby biomass burning emissions impact on that process and hopefully contributing to new climate models for the tropics.\n\nRodriguez-Gomez was born in Medellin, Colombia and grew in the nearby city of Envigado and says she’s always had a passion for science, ever since she was a little kid.\n\n“I always said that as an adult I want to work in the NASA. I don’t know how I came to that idea; maybe because I used to read old and big encyclopedia, play Encarta and saw the planets the earth and learn about that.” Camila Rodriguez-Gomez, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México\n\nAfter studying environmental engineering and trying to work in Colombia, she got the chance to take an internship at the Micro-Mesoscale Interaction group of the Atmospheric Sciences Center in the Universidad Autónoma de México.\n\nDuring this time, she was able to participate in a multidisciplinary investigation about bioparticles in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to a paper publication about bacteria and fungal concentration in the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\n“I found that the atmospheric science is my passion and that I always meant to be a researcher more than an engineer,” she said, adding that she’s now pursuing a masters degree at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.\n\nNow, she’s firmly hooked on clouds and helping to unlock the mysteries of what influences their formation, particularly in the vicinity of Mexico City.\n\nAccording to Rodriguez-Gomez, ice and liquid droplets inside the clouds are formed in the atmosphere with the help of a tiny speck in the air. This tiny particle could come from many sources – a city, deserts, vegetation, ocean and more – and could take many forms including organic matter from living things, dust, soot, car exhaust and more.\n\n“The motivation or big goal is to understand the nucleation (ice formation) ability of the aerosol emitted by Mexico City and the aerosol transported into the valley because it doesn’t exist studies of this topic for any other tropical city,” she said.\n\nAccording to Rodriguez-Gomez, the physics of what is happening inside clouds, specifically ice nucleation, is a not well understood because it has many variables, is hard to study by laboratory reproduction and almost impossible to reproduce under field conditions.\n\n“The biggest challenge of the project is the field campaigns because the samples are taken at 4000 meters, between two volcanoes: Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl.” Camila Rodriguez-Gomez, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México\n\n“The height and extreme climatic conditions of the site makes everything harder, since a little walk to an equipment installation,” she said, adding that the collection field work can last between 3 days to a full week.\n\n“We collect aerosol samples early in the midnight (12 am-6am) and in the midday (1pm to 6 pm),” she said.\n\nRodriguez-Gomez says the reason this work is important is that it could form the basis for better climate models, given that there are’t ice-nucleation results from Mexico and it hasn’t been possible to make alliances with other universities and investigation groups to understand the phenomena better in the tropics.\n\nInstrumentation at the meterological station Altzomoni, between the volcanoes Popocatepetl ...

            "content": "Bali, Indonesia - As fears over the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, continue to dominate the headlines, a second virus affecting China's swine industry is also spreading throughout the Asia Pacific region, threatening not only the lives of the affected animals but also the livelihood of farmers who raise them.\n\nAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a contagious disease that affects domestic and wild pigs, causing high fever, respiratory problems, internal bleeding and skin haemorrhages. While it rarely infects humans, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), it kills 80 percent of the pigs it infects.\n\nMore:\n\nThe disease is resistant to freezing, thawing and most commercial disinfectants, and there is no vaccine for it. It can spread through non-biological objects like shoes and clothing.\n\nLast year, ASF wiped out 60 percent of domestic pigs in China and a quarter of all domestic pigs in the world, according to estimates by contagious disease experts, running into billions of dollars worldwide.\n\nIn Taiwan, dead pigs carrying ASF have washed up on its beaches, while in the Philippines, tens of thousands of infected pigs have been killed or culled since September 2019.\n\nIn South Korea, photos have emerged of a river turned red by blood from mass culls at pig farms and in Indonesia's province of North Sumatra, authorities confirmed some 5,000 pigs died from the virus last year.\n\nNow ASF, which originated in Kenya, has likely reached the Indonesian island of Bali, where the impact could be severe, experts said.\n\nA staple in Bali\n\nUnlike the rest of Indonesia, where pork is not a staple, pigs play a vital role in the economy, community and religion of the Hindu-majority island, which is already reeling from the overnight loss of a quarter of its foreign tourists after flights from China were banned earlier this month to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nLast week, the head of Bali's agriculture and food security agency, Ida Bagus Wisnuardhana, told the Jakarta Post that close to 1,000 pigs had died from ASF, citing tests conducted on blood samples taken from dead pigs.\n\nHowever, a day later he backtracked, saying the dead pigs were only exhibiting ASF-like symptoms, adding that further analysis was required. Bali's provincial government corroborated the retraction, saying similar diseases with the same symptoms often attack pigs.\n\nBut the owner of one of the largest meat processing factories in Bali told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity that ASF was \"obviously\" the cause.\n\n\"I am absolutely sure it's swine fever because it's spreading in the region so it's the most obvious cause. But it's not a big issue because the only way for it to infect humans is to be working in a piggery and even then it's extremely rare,\" the owner said.\n\n\"The biggest impact of swine fever is economic, and pig farmers could lose all the money they've spent on feeds.\"\n\nImpact on community\n\nNyoman, a pig farmer in Munggu Village, told Al Jazeera all but three of his 64 pigs have died from a mysterious illness.\n\n\"The government came here and advised me not to sell the dead pigs, to bury them, and to disinfect everything,\" said Nyoman who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name only.\n\n\"They said they're still examining the cause but I think it's ASF because farmers in other villages are saying their pigs had similar symptoms.\"\n\nNyoman's last remaining adult pig is now showing some of the same symptoms: the animal has not eaten in days, is lethargic and breathing heavily.\n\nA man prepares feed for his pigs at a farm in Makassar, Indonesia [File: Yusuf Ahmad/Reuters]\n\n\"I tried treating my pigs with antibiotics and vitamins like B-complex and zinc but it didn't work. This pig will die sooner or later and then her piglets will die too,\" he said.\n\n\"How will I survive? I haven't thought about it yet. I've only been in this business for a year and I borrowed lots of money to set it up.\"\n\nSuci Ernawati, another Muggu Village pig farmer whose animals are dying, also suspects ASF is the cause.\n\n\"Two of my 10 pigs suddenly got sick with high fevers and died. The symptoms are a little different so we don't know for sure what it is. But people are saying it's ASF.\"\n\nNow, ASF is also threatening Australia.\n\nAustralia next?\n\nLast last year, ASF was detected in East Timor, which lies only 650km (404 miles) northwest of the Australian city of Darwin.\n\nPork Chop, left, leads the field through the first corner in the racing and diving pig show at the Royal Melbourne Show, on September 23, 2008 [William WEST/AFP]\n\nVictoria state's agricultural department Victoria described the outbreak in East Timor as \"significant because it represents the closest outbreak of this exotic disease to Australia since the first Asian diagnosis in China.\"\n\nDirector of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Trevor Drew, said the virus is now perfectly positioned to penetrate Australia, where it could have devastating effects on the country's meat export business.\n\n\"We are very concerned, so our border controls and our surveillance has really been ramped up, to do our very best to keep the disease out of the country,\" he said.\n\nThe professor added that \"nearly 50 percent\" of meat products tourists had tried to sneak past customs at Australian airports had tested positive for ASF and that many of those individuals were refused entry as a result.\n\nWarning not heeded\n\nDrew said he has been warning authorities in China about ASF since 2009 but his words fell on deaf ears.\n\n\"Knowing about the way pigs are raised in Asia by subsistence farmers in backyard sites, where there's very little in the way of biosecurity measures, it was inevitable ASF was going to spread.\"\n\nTo contain the virus, he adds, \"it's absolutely critical that any country that has it confirms and declares it promptly\".\n\nBut in Bali, authorities appear more focused on containing the public relations fallout, with an \"It's safe to eat pork\" campaign being unrolled throughout the island.\n\nThe OIE said the risk of humans being infected with ASF through the consumption of pork products is \"negligible\".\n\nStill, many in Bali are not prepared to take the risk.\n\n\"I think pork that has been approved by the government is fine but, for now, my family won't eat it,\" Nyoman, the pig farmer from Munggu village, said. His neighbour Suci Ernawati is also abstaining.\n\nBusiness is also reportedly slow among restaurants selling \"babi guling\", Bali's iconic suckling pig, which is prepared for Hindu ceremonies, weddings and the like.\n\nAccording to the staff at Babi Guling Selingsing Bu Suci, a shop near Munggu, customers have been scarce since the swine fever scare began.\n\nWhile they insist that their supply is safe, they are worried that the situation could become worse in the weeks and months to come if the problem is not addressed."

            "content": "Project Signing: New World Bank Project to Improve Groundwater Management in Select States of India\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Government of India and the World Bank today signed a $450 million loan agreement to support the national programme to arrest the country’s depleting groundwater levels and strengthen groundwater institutions.\n\nThe World Bank-supported Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABHY) – National Groundwater Management Improvement Programme will be implemented in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh and cover 78 districts. These states span both the hard rock aquifers of peninsular India and the alluvial aquifers of the Indo-Gangetic plains. They were selected based on several criteria, including degree of groundwater exploitation and degradation, established legal and regulatory instruments, institutional readiness, and experience in implementing initiatives related to groundwater management.\n\nThe programme will, among others, enhance the recharge of aquifers and introduce water conservation practices; promote activities related to water harvesting, water management, and crop alignment; create an institutional structure for sustainable groundwater management; and equip communities and stakeholders to sustainably manage groundwater.\n\nShri Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance said that in India groundwater is an important source for rural and urban domestic water supplies and its depletion is a cause of concern. The Atal Bhujal Yojana intends to strengthen the institutional framework for participatory groundwater management and encourage behavioral changes at the community level for sustainable groundwater resource management. The use of cutting-edge technology, involving Artificial Intelligence and space technology will further help in better implementation of the programme.\n\nThe loan agreement was signed by Shri Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, on behalf of the Government of India and Mr Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, India on behalf of the World Bank.\n\nMr Junaid Ahmad said that groundwater is India’s most crucial water reserve and managing this national resource is the need of the hour. This programme will contribute to rural livelihoods and in the context of climatic shifts, build resilience of the rural economy. But its impact will also be felt globally as it stands as one of the important programmes of groundwater management worldwide.\n\nThe last few decades saw an exponential growth in the exploitation of groundwater through the construction of millions of private wells. Between 1950 and 2010, the number of drilled tube wells increased from 1 million to nearly 30 million. This allowed the area irrigated by groundwater to increase from approximately 3 million ha to more than 35 million ha. Groundwater currently provides approximately 60 percent of irrigation water. Over 80 percent of the rural and urban domestic water supplies in India are served by groundwater making India the world’s largest user of groundwater.\n\nIf the current trends persist, 60 percent of districts are likely to reach critical level of groundwater depletion within two decades, which in turn will render at least 25 percent of the agriculture production at risk. Climate change will likely exacerbate current pressures on groundwater resources.\n\nThe programme will introduce a bottom-up planning process for community-driven development of water budgets and Water Security Plans (WSPs). Water budgets will assess surface and groundwater conditions (both quantity and quality) and identify current and future needs. The WSP, on the other hand, will focus on improving groundwater quantity and incentivize selected states to implement the actions proposed. Such community-led management measures will make users aware of consumption patterns and pave the way for economic measures that reduce groundwater consumption.\n\n“The Programme will support on-ground actions that are based on community ownership and judicious management of water resources. Reversing groundwater overexploitation and degradation is in the hands of the hundreds of millions of individuals and communities – they need the right incentives, information, support, and resources to move to a more sustainable development and management of groundwater resources,” said Abedalrazq Khalil and Satya Priya, Senior Water Resources Management Specialists and World Bank’s Task Team Leaders for the programme.\n\nCrop management and diversification will be the other focus areas. Studies indicate that a one percent increase in the area irrigated with groundwater leads to a 2.2 percent increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Also, a one percent increase in irrigation efficiency will reduce GHG emissions by 20 percent. The programme will support adoption of micro-irrigation systems, including sprinkler and drip irrigation to increase productivity and support farmers to shift to low water-intensive crops.\n\nTo facilitate this process, the government will transfer a significant portion of the money (nearly 80 percent) to local governments, including districts and gram panchayats, as incentives for achieving targets in groundwater management. The remaining funds will be used for providing technical support for sustainable management of groundwater and strengthening institutional arrangements in the selected states.\n\nThe $450 million loan, from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 6-year grace period, and a maturity of 18 years.\n\n****\n\nRM/KMN"

We still have quite a way to go if we want to close the loop on circular fashion, but the growing fashion rental economy is helping to push our consumption in a more sustainable direction.\n\nIn the past few years, the fashion rental economy has grown at an exceptional rate. American company Rent the Runway was one of the first big names in the rental business, and it's still going strong a whole decade layer. Since then, the UK has quickly followed suit with dozens of fashion rental websites and apps, specilising in everything from certified vintage gems to peer-to-peer lending, and even niche companies — like Cocoon that only rents luxury handbags.\n\nWe've scoured the web to find you seven of the absolute best fashion rental websites and apps that will elevate your wardrobe, while cutting your consumption in half."

            "content": "In the US we have the primaries and presidential elections this year but in the EU the budgetary negotiations will make for a good reality TV. Some will be losers, and some will be winners.\n\nDutch prime minister Mark Rutte and his allies from Denmark, Sweden and Austria for sure want to be winners and say that the next European budget should be smaller because of Brexit.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nThis is the Europe's 'Frugal Four', which braces itself for its bloodiest-ever round of budget talks in Brussels. Germany passed on the chance to be at the front of the fight, and seems more neutral (with some former Eastern states of the country still receiving cohesion funds).\n\nCharles Michel, head of the European Council, wants to end the 'battle-royale' mayhem this February. Many see that as very optimistic. He is a seasoned negotiator but this will be just his second time as the host to all European leaders.\n\nThe Croatians, which have the rotating presidency, also want to finish the talks soon, as well as the group of countries calling themselves 'Friends of Cohesion' - which consists of 15 countries that benefit directly from cohesion policy, such as Portugal, Poland or Hungary.\n\nBut make no mistake: it took about two-and-a-half years to reach compromise on the previous multiannual financial framework (MFF), for 2014-2020.\n\nThe range of negotiations is between 1.00 percent and 1.11 percent of EU-27 gross national income (GNI) - which appears to conflate two well-known positions.\n\nAccording to Rutte it's only logical that the budget should shrink after Brexit. And within that smaller budget it's only logical that wealthy states should pay approximately the same amount as before and still get the famous rebate.\n\nThis is the first thing that the argument made by the Dutch politician gets wrong.\n\nFor the EU Commission the rebates given first to the UK in 1984 will disappear with the Brits in 2020. Rebates and discounts granted to other countries, including Austria and Germany, are also up for the chop.\n\nThe commission says the benefits need to be scrapped in order to simplify the complex EU financial systems. Concessions made to the UK did not make it more loyal to the European project.\n\nThe second issue with the Dutch approach is calling themselves a \"net payer\". According to Rutte \"we are net payers and I don't see why we have to pay more\". Thanks to profit-shifting of multinationals this statement does not hold.\n\nThomas Piketty made the opposite argument in his works. Add to that the increased trade - for each euro spent another one and half is created in trade in Netherlands. Everybody in the single market with the help of the cohesion policy is a \"net receiver\".\n\nMoreover, if we would count the influx of immigrants to the Dutch labour market (for example, 185,000 Poles and more than 330,000 immigrants from \"net receivers\") they created approximately €15bn of value added to the Dutch economy in 2018 (almost 2 percent of GDP).\n\nThat is a bit more than the €7bn contribution that Netherlands pays, and still more than the possible €10bn under the commission's plan.\n\nPolish, Hungarian veto?\n\nThere are some fears that countries such as Poland and Hungary could derail the budget process by threatening to veto the European Commission's proposal to link EU funding to sound financial management and judicial independence.\n\nThe Dutch are for this solution because \"people of Europe can flourish only if the rule of law applies in all member states. If our citizens can trust each other's legal systems.\"\n\nThis is the third issue that is somewhat wrong. If we are to enforce rule of law why is the only penalty provided for the poorer countries?\n\nIf there would be a discussion about the issues connected with rule of law in the Netherlands, Austria, Malta or Italy the commission would not have tools to use. Both poor and rich governments need to be held accountable if they break the law. We need a just system in the justice department.\n\nRutte and some other European politicians think it is time that the old European economic model of subsidising agriculture gave way to a new economy, based on knowledge and innovation.\n\nA great cause - if Europe were not an agricultural superpower.\n\nPeople often think that not much changes in European agriculture. This is the fourth argument far from true. Farming is one of the most innovative economic sectors in Europe - think about drones monitoring our crops, waterbeds for cows or innovations in plant-breeding.\n\nWith agriculture most affected by climate change in the last years, drought and insufficient watering we might need to rethink agricultural policy - but I do not think we will manage to do that before the end of this year.\n\nWe discuss a meat tax in order to limit greenhouse gas emissions but we still want to subsidise agriculture.\n\nTo change European agriculture we need more time in order to make those changes viable.\n\nWith droughts in the last few years, some countries might have a problem to take a proposal of depleting the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) seriously, because it would mean a lot of insolvencies in Italy or France.\n\nNevertheless, CAP can be used to boost innovation and mitigate climate change. Let's talk about this aspects of the policy.\n\nThe Dutch tax sandwich\n\nRutte is for chopping the European budget and its redistributive mechanisms.\n\nBut each year according to the Missing Profits of Nations project, the Netherlands get €7.1bn of additional corporate income tax revenues which should be payed in other tax jurisdictions.\n\nMuch of that revenue comes from those countries which are on the receiving end of cohesion policy.\n\nAccording to the TAX3 commission report from the European Parliament, the Netherlands are basically a tax haven. The Netherlands 'wins' a lot of money on the single market.\n\nThere are five other EU countries which technically are tax havens, according to the parliament.\n\nFrom a justice standpoint we could give the commission the power to impose sanctions on countries (including EU member states) that have been classified as tax havens, so we heal the European tax system."
