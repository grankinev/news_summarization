            "content": "A previous version of this report incorrectly attributed to Google a new approach to climate-change policy that the company had not undertaken. A third party, posing as Google, made the announcement.\n\nMarketWatch and other technology and investing sites misreported earlier Wednesday that Google parent Alphabet would cut ties with lobbyists and think tanks that deny accelerating man-made climate change.\n\nThe search giant GOOGL, +0.05% GOOG, +0.10% also reportedly had announced plans to cut ties with fossil-fuel sources. Except it did not make that announcement.\n\nThe posting was a prank put out by the New York City arm of a climate protest group, which has called out Google’s practices before.\n\nNews sites generally believed that, amid the coronavirus pandemic, April Fools Day parody releases, for which media outlets are on alert at this time of year, would be rare or nonexistent this year given the rising U.S. death toll. At the same time, attention remains fixed on technology firms and their sustainability efforts after Microsoft MSFT, +0.79% and others have announced zero- or net-positive carbon emissions and other initiatives.\n\nAnd:Microsoft aims to be ‘carbon negative’ by 2030\n\nStill, MarketWatch should have given more scrutiny than usual to any release of this nature, no matter its apparent seriousness. Such coverage is not fair to readers who are trying to discern the science-based facts on both coronavirus and the long-run effects of climate change. We can all be more responsible.\n\nRead:Amazon has ‘ambitious but achievable’ plan to hit Paris climate goals 10 years early and go carbon neutral by 2040\n\nLate last year, more than 1,000 Google workers signed a public letter calling on their employer to commit to an aggressive “company-wide climate plan” that includes canceling contracts with the fossil fuel industry and halting its donations to climate-change deniers, including those in Wednesday’s protest release. That letter had urged neutral emissions by 2030.\n\nGoogle does also use some renewable energy, announcing in 2018 that it purchases more renewable energy than it consumes as a company.\n\nRead:Trump to meet with CEOs of oil companies over helping the industry"

            "content": "The global coronavirus pandemic has put our economy in free-fall.\n\nEven through Donald Trump's reckless economic policies, like his pointless trade war with China or his deficit-busting tax cuts for his billionaire donors, the economy has somehow managed to keep chugging along — until now.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAll of the stock market gains from Trump's time in office have been wiped out, and over the course of just over one week in March the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its five largest drops in history.\n\nWorse than a plummeting stock market, businesses and major industries have been forced to shutter their windows to help combat the rapid spread of the virus, putting hundreds of thousands of workers' paychecks at risk.\n\nA recession is inevitable at this point. Here are 3 things we can do to prepare.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nNumber one: We need to reform unemployment insurance so it reflects the needs of today's economy.\n\nWhen it was first created in 1935, unemployment insurance was designed to help full-time workers weather downturns until they got their old jobs back. But there are fewer full-time jobs in today's economy, and fewer people who are laid off get their old jobs back again.\n\nAs a result, only 27% of unemployed workers receive benefits today, compared to 49% of workers in the 1950s. We need to expand unemployment coverage so that everyone is protected.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nNumber two: We need to strengthen Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, also known as public assistance.\n\nSince its creation in 1996, the number of families receiving cash assistance has declined dramatically – and not because they're doing well. Between 2006 and 2018, just 13% of families were lifted out of poverty, while the number of families receiving public assistance fell by 39%.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAlready weak, the program didn't hold up well during the Great Recession. Funding doesn't automatically expand during economic downturns – meaning the more families are in need, the less money there is to help them. The program also has strict work requirements, which can't be fulfilled in a deep recession. Worse yet, many individuals in need have already exhausted their five years of lifetime eligibility for assistance.\n\nWe need to reform the public assistance program so that more families in need are eligible. It should be easier to waive the strict work eligibility requirements during the economic downturn, and the lifetime five-year limit should be suspended.\n\nNumber three: We need to protect the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nUnlike public assistance, SNAP responded well during the Great Recession. Its requirements are designed to expand during economic downturns or recessions.\n\nWaiving work requirements during the Great Recession made thousands of people in need eligible for the program who otherwise wouldn't have been. Between December 2007 and December 2009, the number of SNAP participants rose by 45%. The program helped keep an estimated 3.8 million families out of poverty in 2009.\n\nBut that might not be an option this time around, as SNAP has come under attack from the Trump administration, which is trying to enact a draconian rule change that would kick an estimated 700,000 of our most vulnerable citizens off of the program. Luckily, a judge blocked the rule from going into effect, but the administration is still fighting to enforce it — even in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to make sure SNAP's flexibility and ability to respond to economic downturns is protected before the next recession hits.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nStronger safety nets are not only good for individuals and families in need. They will also prevent the looming recession from becoming an even deeper and longer economic crisis."

            "content": "A year ago, it was estimated that the “global startup economy” created nearly $3 trillion in economic value between 2016 and 2018. Now, billions of dollars of that economic value may be leaking away, likely by the day.\n\nIn a new report out today, my friends at Startup Genome have taken a first pass at how the global pandemic is already affecting startup ecosystems. The biggest impact has been in China, since COVID-19 hit there first. In the short period from November-December 2019 to January-February 2020, venture investing fell off a cliff in China. Just since the beginning of this year, Chinese venture investing has dropped by over 50% relative to the rest of the world.\n\nIf other parts of the world experience declines of similar magnitude, “$28 billion in startup investment will go missing” this year alone. That will mean more layoffs than have occurred already in many startup hotspots. Already, according to Dealroom, since the end of January, tech and internet companies in Europe have lost almost €400 billion in total.\n\nThese numbers are staggering.\n\nAcross Asia, we may be seeing additional effects. Corporate venture investors piled into late-stage funding rounds in recent years, driving up valuations. Some of those investors now appear to be selling (FT:$) their startup stakes at discounts. If Startup Genome’s analysis is an indication, we could see similar moves in the United States and Europe. In 2019, nearly four in 10 corporate venture capital deals globally were in North America, virtually the same share as Asia. In 2008 and 2009, corporate venture investors pulled back more sharply, and earlier, than others.\n\nStartup Investments in China and Asia, Dec 2019-Jan 2020. Startup Genome\n\nVenture-backed startups represent only a fraction of what constitutes a vibrant startup ecosystem. Tech startups that don’t have VC money (which is most of them), trying to build their companies on cash flow, face serious shortfalls. In every region, there will be plenty of potential high-growth companies who don’t attract venture capital but who are important job creators. Their potential trajectories will be stunted by the current crisis. Small businesses that are not growth-oriented—but no less important for the ecosystem—are already hurting because of forced closures and falling sales.\n\nYet venture-backed companies have large multipliers: high-tech companies create four or five other jobs for every job they create directly. The economic hit they take over the next two quarters will radiate outward. And as JF Gauthier and Arnobio Morelix, authors of the Startup Genome report, point out, the crisis will hurt startups that were in the middle of fundraising and will likely be a “fatal” blow to many.\n\nHopin’ in the Gloamin’\n\nAs the Startup Genome report notes, and as I’ve written before, there could be reasons for optimism. Good companies do emerge out of recessions. More than 50 tech unicorns, the report finds, were founded during the recessionary years of 2007-09. Over half the companies on the Fortune 500 were founded during a recession or bear market.\n\nEven if overall VC funding is down, moreover, it could mean that more companies get funded after the downturn. The Startup Genome report shows that, after the 2001 and 2008-09 busts and recessions, the number of companies funded by venture capitalists grew rapidly. From 2010 to 2014, for example, the number of VC deals grew by at least 25 percent each year.\n\nStartups in some areas, such as delivery, are understandably doing well thanks to greater demand today.\n\nThose glimmers of hope offer little amelioration, of course, to founders and employees in most other sectors—they are feeling the pain today. And, there is no guarantee that the recovery from this recession will look like the past. This is something different.\n\nWhat Is Being Done to Help Startups\n\nEncouragingly, the rapid increase in resources devoted to startup ecosystem development over the last several years means governments now recognize the importance of targeting startups for assistance. In France, the government is looking to help companies that were in the middle of raising a round of financing. Tax breaks and loan guarantees are also planned.\n\nIn Germany, too, the government is searching for ways to help startups survive. The British government has rolled out aid specifically for the self-employed—that may not help all startups but will assist a significant number of entrepreneurs.\n\nIn the United States, Congress has authorized billions of dollars in new loan guarantees , expanded disaster loans, and grants through the Small Business Administration. There is some question as to whether or not individual venture-backed startups can qualify for these measures, but that appears to be in the process of being worked out. The New Business Preservation Act, introduced into the U.S. Senate, would try to help distribute venture capital around the country. That could be helpful since, according to Pitchbook, the crisis will likely mean a reduction in VC available to regions outside the major tech hubs.\n\nWhat else should governments and others be considering when it comes to the COVID-19 crisis and their startups?\n\nFirst: Life Support\n\nEmergency support to businesses—young, small, venture-backed, local—is the right first move. The bakery down the block, the flower shop around the corner, the fintech startup in the offices above the bakery, the life sciences startup in the research park off the next highway exit—they all need immediate help to get through this shock. Throwing money at the problem probably is the best option right now.\n\nIt’s likely true that some businesses that are unproductive or at least not succeeding—and those classified as “zombies”—will receive support and sustain themselves. The low-interest-rate environment that has helped funnel money into venture funds has also meant that a lot of companies have been able to survive on debt and leverage. We’ll have to be ok with this. Market forces aren’t exactly operating smoothly right now. The “reallocation” dynamics that economists talk about have been stifled for the moment.\n\nRecovery will come, eventually. Lockdowns will abate. Normal routines will return at varying speeds. Then what? What can public and private organizations do to help the startups that emerge scarred but determined from the crisis? What should be done to help all the companies that will be founded in the coming months?\n\nSecond: Ecosystem Support\n\nLet’s think about some of what we’re already learning in the midst of the crisis. I’ll just mention three here, but it would be good to hear from you as to what you think the crisis means for ecosystem support and development.\n\nFirst, one of the winners from this crisis is and will be big business. This means corporate engagement with startups—a long-recognized yet mostly unrealized dimension of ecosystem development—will be crucially important. Many have tried to get this right; few have. It’s time we really figured it out.\n\nSecond, barriers to fluid labor markets need to go. Some states have moved to fast-track licensing for healthcare providers to expedite migration from other states. This should call into question the existence of such barriers in the first place. Occupational and professional licensing, noncompete agreements, and more—these will hinder business creation and recovery. Reform yours now.\n\nThird, the failures of testing are by now well-documented and can largely be ascribed to regulatory hurdles and bureaucratic bungling. This should alert us to the importance of smooth and efficient processes for technology commercialization. You can bet that there will be a wave of new companies, if there isn’t already, that form to take on major challenges in public health, infectious disease, logistics, precision medicine, and more. They deserve efficient processes that have innovation and social benefit as the objectives.\n\nThere is certainly more that can and should be done. Soon, your ecosystem leaders will be able to turn their attention from life support to ecosystem support. By paving the way for existing startups and those soon to be in existence, they can help ensure that 20 years from now we will be tallying the number of leading companies founded during the COVID pandemic."

            "content": "BEIJING, March 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Huaneng Power International, Inc. (\"HPI\", or the \"Company\") (NYSE: HNP; HKEx: 902; SSE: 600011) today announced its audited operating results prepared under IFRS for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the twelve months ended 31 December 2019, the Company realized consolidated operating revenue of RMB174.009 billion (equivalent to approximately USD 24.943 billion, based on the exchange rate of USD 1 to RMB 6.9762 as of December 31, 2019), representing an increase of 2.63% compared to the same period last year, and net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company amounted to RMB766 million (equivalent to approximately USD 110 million), representing an increase of 4.34% as compared with the same period last year. Earnings per share amounted to RMB0.01(equivalent to approximately USD 0.001), ADS amounted to RMB0.20 (equivalent to approximately USD 0.029). The main reason for the increase of the net profit is the comprehensive impact of the decrease of fuel costs year-on-year and the increase of asset impairment loss. The Board is satisfied with the Company's results last year.\n\nThe Board proposed to declare a cash dividend of RMB0.135 (inclusive of tax) for each ordinary share of the Company held by shareholders.\n\nIn 2019, the Company proactively adapted to the changes in the market and anticipated the dynamics of the reforms in national economy and power market system to promptly realign its operating strategy. Throughout the year, the Company maintained stable operation of safe and clean production, achieved notable results in improving quality and efficiency, made headway in optimizing the structure, and strengthened its corporate governance. As a result, the Company has satisfactorily achieved its annual business objectives and maintained its leading position in the industry.\n\nIn 2019, total power generated by the Company's domestic operating power plants for the year on consolidated basis amounted to 405.006 billion kWh, representing a year-on-year decrease of 5.91%. The electricity sold amounted to 388.182 billion kWh, representing a year-on-year decrease of 4.38%. The annual average utilization hours of the Company's domestic power plants reached 3,915 hours, representing a year-on-year decrease of 293 hours. The utilization hours of coal-fired power generating units was 4,222 hours, representing a year-on-year decrease of 273 hours. In most of the areas where the Company's coal-fired power plants are located, the utilization hours of the Company were in a leading position. Total heat supplied by the Company's domestic operating power plants on consolidated basis amounted to 240 million GJ, representing a year-on-year increase of 10.69%.\n\nThroughout the year, the Company procured an aggregate of 183 million tons of coal. By continuously and accurately judging coal market trends, optimizing procurement strategy and regional supply structure, reinforcing cooperation with major coal mines, targeting high- quality low- cost resources on an advanced basis, and reducing the increase of unit procurement price of standard coal effectively. The unit fuel cost of its domestic power plants throughout the year incurred for sales of power was RMB223.22/MWh, representing a year-on-year decrease of 5.77%.\n\nIn 2019, The Company maintains a leading position among major domestic power companies in terms of safe operations, technology economy and energy – consuming index. In 2019, the Company maintains a leading position among major domestic power companies, with the average equivalent availability ratio of the coalfired generating units of the Company was 93.49%; its weighted average house consumption rate was 4.49%; the average yearly coal consumption rate for the power generated was 288.52 grams/kWh; and the Company's average coal consumption rate for power sold was 307.21 grams/kWh. As per the demand for resolutely fighting against pollution, the Company actively carried out the three year action plan to defend the blue sky. With respect to air pollution emissions, the power generation companies affiliated to the Company have carried out ultralow-emissions transformation as planned with marked results. All of them have met or out-performed the national emission standards. With respect to treatment of unorganized emissions such as wastewater discharge and coal yards and ash yards, the Company has allocated funds to carry out environmental technological transformation projects such as wastewater treatment, coal yard closure, and ash yard transformation in power plants in key regions. All power plants have accelerated environmental protection transformation projects to ensure that pollutant emissions meet the requirements under pollution discharge permits and other ecological and environmental protection policies."

            "content": "Yves here. While you were busy with impeachment and then coronavirus, the EU has been moving forward with a “Green Deal”. But what to make of it?\n\nBy Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website\n\nThe unstoppable global health emergency has ripped away the fabric of normality. Every day brings news of developments which, only a few weeks ago, would have felt utterly impossible. Who would have believed, in mid-February, that schools and universities would be closed by mid-March, public gatherings cancelled, cities and whole nations and billions of people would be put under lock-down, and hundreds of millions of people around the world would be out of work? Who would have predicted that many governments would work tirelessly to put together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history, to support (big, and sometimes also small) firms and give income protection to workers and households, that central banks would (again) provide emergency liquidity, commercial banks would be waiving mortgage payments, and landlords would refrain from collecting rents?\n\nWho could have imagined that the majority of people, forced to remain at home, are glued to their computers and/or smart phones, more dependent than ever on the Big Tech companies, feeding them – willingly or unwillingly – with ever more private information, thereby putting the already fast growth of surveillance capitalism on steroids? Or that governments would be using drones to impose social distancing on their populations and/or using mobile phone tracking to do the same?\n\nWhile the world will not be the same once this is over, we must recognize that novel disasters and emergencies do not remove or resolve older, existing problems—the biggest one of which is, without doubt, accelerating climate change. Despite clear differences, the Covid-19 calamity and global warming share important similarities: both problems present catastrophic risks to humanity which were long identified by scientists and both have been willfully neglected by governments and most political parties unable to see beyond the next election; both problems require unprecedented levels of global co-operation to be sorted and both demand transformative change today in order to prevent catastrophic outcomes in future; and redressing the risks of pandemics and global warming will require new innovative effective forms of coordinated, government-led action worldwide, rather than reliance on the ‘logic of the marketplace’ and private-sector initiative.\n\nThis brings me back to the future: if we manage to get to a post-covid-19 world, humanity still will have to confront the problem and risks of global warming. The one credible strategy to bring about ‘climate neutrality’ is the European Union’s Green Deal, which is almost forgotten in the corona-tragedy and the coming global recession. It is deserving of a closer look.\n\nThe European Union’s ‘Man-on-the-Moon’ Moment …..\n\nThe European Union (EU) has done it, or so it appears. Its “Green Deal”, an ambitious rethinking of the European economy, transport, building and energy sectors, unveiled by the European Commission in December 2019, has been hailed as the first comprehensive plan to achieve “climate-neutrality” at a continental scale. It involves a €1 trillion, 10-year investment plan to fund a drastic reduction of the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2030 by 55% compared with 1990 — and to realize zero (net) emissions or “climate neutrality” by 2050. The investment programme of €1 trillion is to be financed from leveraged public and private funds and to be channelled into greening the economy. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission calls the Green Deal “Europe’s man-on-the-moon moment” and has outlined a detailed roadmap of more than 50 actions the EU will have to take over the next decade to reach its emissions goal.\n\nThe Green Deal has received a mostly warm welcome. Most commentators see it as a courageous, bold and even visionary step in the right direction of a prosperous, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economy. Jeffrey Sachs hails it “a demonstration of European social democracy at work. A mixed economy, combining markets, government regulation, the public sector, and civil society, will pursue a mixed strategy, combining public goals, public and private investments, and public support”.\n\nPredictably, business interests and centre-right economists fear the Green Deal will cripple European industries, as the new rules will raise cost of production, the proposed carbon border tax will hurt international trade, and the EU’s moral grandstanding on a go-it-alone transition to a carbon-neutral economy will do nothing to stop global warming from accelerating. Perhaps surprisingly, strong critiques have been voiced by climate scientists, environmental activists and critical economists, to whom Europe’s Green Deal is not ambitious and transformative enough, offering too little, too late.\n\nThe latter critics are, in turn, accused of not offering constructive engagement with the Green Deal and, by burning down what is in essence a far-reaching reform of the EU policy orientation, they are accused of promoting fatalism and cynicism. Indeed, this is the dilemma: if Otto von Bismarck was right that “politics is the art of the possible, the attainable — the art of the next best”, then the Green Deal does constitute a major advance and all efforts should be concentrated on expanding what is “attainable”.\n\nI am not so sure. First, all the evidence is telling us that ‘business-as-usual’ is over, as the climate emergency is building fast: on present trends, humanity will have exhausted the remaining global carbon budget in a decade. Either we act decisively, or we don’t — in which case we have to brace ourselves for the damage coming from runaway warming, and adaptation to climate change becomes a must. Half-hearted tinkering will not bring us anywhere. Second, the Green Deal is the new signature mission of the Union, its new raison d’être, and a failure to bring about a green and economically inclusive and just transformation of the EU economy cannot but give the project of European unification a fatal blow. The stakes are high, therefore, and a dispassionate, constructive look at the Green Deal is needed in light of the climate reality. This is what the Working Paper does.\n\nAmbition and speed\n\nTo achieve the Green Deal emission reduction target of 55% by 2030, GHG emissions by the EU-27 have to decline by as much as 5.2% per year during the next decade — which is three times faster than during 1990-2020. The ambition level is certainly commendable, yet it still falls short of what is, according to climate science, needed to prevent the global mean temperature from rising above the safe threshold of 1.5° Celsius (with a probability of 66%). The EU-27 have an obligation and ability to do more, in order to protect enough the ‘carbon development space’ for the more than six billion people in the developing countries. Bigger reductions in GHG emissions will require even faster decarbonisation and a shift toward 100% renewable energy of the EU as soon as possible — the ‘binding’ target of achieving a renewable energy share of final energy use of at least 32% in 2030 falls short of what is necessary.\n\nScale of the Green Deal\n\nThe European Commission estimates that the EU27 need € 260 billion of green investments per year over the next decade to bring down GHG emissions by 40% in 2030. €260 billion amounts to around 2% of GDP of the EU27. These numbers do not take into account the new stricter target to reduce GHG emissions in 2030 by 55% (and not 40%). The higher reduction target will require higher capital expenditures; the investment requirement for a 55% emission reduction target would roughly be around 3% of GDP (or €400 billion) each year, and for a more ambitious goal to cut emissions by 65% in 2030 investment would amount to around 4.5% of GDP per annum. The current Green Deal is under-funded.\n\nFurthermore, almost all of the public Green Deal funding is money reshuffled from existing EU funds or based on national co-financing or founded on promises to leverage private-sector capital by taking away the risk for these investors, whose investments will be guaranteed by the EU budget. National co-financing is unlikely to involve additional spending, because member states have to stick to the deflationary straightjacket of the Stability and Growth Pact. All in all, the Green Deal will generate only € 1.1 billion per year in newexpenditures by the European Commission under the Just Transition Mechanism (JTM).\n\nThis reprogramming of already projected expenditures makes it a bit of a stretch to call the Green Deal a ‘growth strategy’. The extent to which it will spur private investment is highly uncertain. The transition to a carbon-neutral economy will lead to massive disinvestment and ‘stranded assets’ (in fossil-fuel based industries) and the destruction of large numbers of jobs in extractive industries (coal mining), fossil-fuel energy-producing and manufacturing industries (such as automobiles). True, the Green Deal will be creating new jobs in renewable energy generation, housing renovation, building and maintaining low-carbon energy infrastructures and in services. But the transformation will be upsetting, massive and risky, and the slower the radical restructuring and the reallocation of labour across industries, and the larger the distributional impacts, the higher will be the overall transition costs and the more economic growth will be hurt. The European Commission takes too narrow a view of the distributional consequences of the Green Deal, which makes it look rather badly prepared to guide the process of structural transformation — and this is careless in view of the rather low level of popular support for the climate transition.\n\nSubstance of the Deal\n\nOn paper the Green Deal looks impressive: it includes a ‘farm-to-fork’ sustainable agriculture strategy and plans for a carbon-neutral ‘circular economy’; it proposes to start a ‘renovation wave’ to improve energy efficiency of the building stock; it favours the rapid development of renewable energy generation; it proposes a carbon border tax on carbon-polluting foreign firms in an effort to provide space to EU firms to decarbonize; and it wants to reform the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) and raise carbon prices to make it more effective. All this makes sense, but the capacity to bring about a structural transformation of the EU27 economy and society is compromised by the under-funding of the investment plan, an unwillingness to envision how the green transition can be made to generate significant co-benefits (in terms of job growth, improved health outcomes and a more fair income distribution) and an under-estimation of restructuring costs, distributional impacts and uncertainties.\n\nConsider the Green Deal’s “Just Transition Mechanism” (JTM), which was put forward as a “pledge of solidarity and fairness”. The JTM will mobilize €100 billion over 10 years, mostly to support the economic restructuring of the regional coal-producing economies of the EU. However, the proposed JTM budget likely falls short of what will be needed to shoulder the social restructuring cost of the ‘coal exit’ and destruction of mining jobs in the EU27. But the EU climate transition is not just affecting the more than 400,000 miners, but is estimated to lead to the destruction of around 4.7 million jobs in so-called ‘brown’ industries (including in automobile manufacturing). What, if anything, does the Green Deal promise these workers in terms of ‘solidarity and fairness’?\n\nTo be clear, the job destruction is only one side of the transition. The shift to EVs will create jobs in building the (fast) charging infrastructure and in producing EV components and batteries (which are now mainly imported from China). There is enormous potential for the growth of green jobs in energy-saving renovation of the building stock and in smart public transport (zero-emission electric buses, trams and light-rail). Hence, when managed properly, the Green Deal will create new jobs in renewable energy generation, housing renovation, and transport. According to ILO (2018), green job growth in the EU during 2020-2030 could exceed ‘brown’ job destruction by around 2 million jobs. But to achieve the green job growth, the EU would need to considerably broaden its current focus — on building charging and refuelling infrastructures for the 13 million zero- and low-emission (mostly private and very expensive) vehicles expected to be on Europe’s roads by 2050 — to smart (and cheap) public transport systems, and from imposing the cost of energy-efficiency renovation on households to socialize the investment cost of housing stock renovation.\n\nRapidly phasing out fossil fuels in power plants (burning coal), industrial facilities, buildings and vehicles will improve air quality by reducing ambient air pollution and this could reduce premature deaths in the EU27 by 300,000 persons each and every year and also drastically lower morbidity, lost working days, and healthcare care (Boyce 2020). The relatively high additional mortality in Europe caused by air pollution has much to do with burning coal. Thirty-three of the 50 most polluted towns in Europe are in Poland, where burning coal is deemed ‘patriotic’ by the government. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, using the official EU default value of € 3.387 million for the value of a statistical life (VSL), an in itself dubious concept to put a euro-value on human mortality, I estimate that the “co-pollutant cost of carbon” in the EU27 would amount to €1 trillion per year.\n\nStrategic Reliance on ‘Green Finance’\n\nThe European Commission puts its faith in private finance to fund the climate transition by promoting green capital formation through a favourable regulatory treatment of green finance, de-risking and credit subsidies. Having lost the battles for tougher regulation and higher taxation and spending, the Commission’s hope is that private finance will do the job of greening the economy. Hence, the idea is to do ‘whatever it takes’ to persuade institutional investors to redirect the trillions of money they are managing to specific activities that are officially labelled as being ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’ according to an official EU Taxonomy. Global finance will only do this of its own accord if it serves its interest. What makes these ‘green investments’ attractive for private finance is the fact that such green assets will be de-risked through EU subsidies and ECB guarantees to support the liquidity of these assets (Gabor 2020a). The EU provides a first-loss guarantee, enabling the EIB to fund riskier (climate-related) investment under the heading of the InvestEU programme.\n\nThe problem with this periphrastic strategy is that it relies heavily on private global financiers — such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs — who are all waist-deep in fossil-fuel investments and, as large shareholders, have been routinely voting against shareholder motions directing corporate boards to take climate action and to integrate environmental concerns in their activities (Gabor 2020a). The Green Deal will be subsidizing carbon financiers, allowing them to make a profit from the climate transition, rather than holding them liable for the GHG emissions (see Richard Heede 2017). The Green Deal offers long-time fossil-fuel financiers a rather easy way out, by providing a cushioned, subsidized exit from fossil-fuel investments toward de-risked ‘green assets’.\n\nThe new class of highly liquid ‘de-risked’ assets, which will be as safe as German Bunds because they are guaranteed by EU (German) taxpayers and the ECB, will be in high demand. After all, the global shadow banking system is permanently short of safe securities, which it can use to collateralize global institutional cash pools (Storm 2018). That is, the ‘de-risked’ assets will further enable the already excessive liquidity preference of global financial investors, who have parked at least $ 5 trillion in collateralized spaces within the global shadow banking system, ready for immediate use in privately very profitable, but socially unproductive financial speculation in short-term exotic derivative instruments. The Green Deal thus ‘rewards’ an already malfunctioning global financial system, rather than ‘punishes’ and regulates it in ways which make ‘brown assets’ more expensive and liable for the (environmental, social and economic) damage it is causing.\n\nIncentivizing private finance will not be enough to bring about the fast and just transition to climate neutrality promised by the European Commission — which requires green industrial policies to catalyze and support private-sector investment and leaning in zero-carbon activities, and proper management of aggregate demand. Industrial policy will be indispensable if the Green Deal is to exploit the considerable potential for energy savings and job growth of large-scale energy-efficiency renovation in buildings. Further, smart public transport requires building up the (charging) infrastructure, using public procurement (of electric buses, trams and trains) to promote the new mobility model, and investing in the development and demonstration of early-phase (battery) technologies and electro-fuels. However, large multinational corporations could, after benefiting from public money, offshore their clean-tech innovations to low-wage countries; indeed, battery production for EVs is currently concentrated in Asia (in China, Japan and South Korea). Green Deal spending should therefore include social clauses, requiring companies to base their production in countries with certain wage levels and labour and environmental legal standards (Gaddi and Garbellini 2019).\n\nAnother issue is that the Green Deal spending will require European planning in order to promote the construction of integrated European value chains (to make the most of economies of scale) and to actively reduce the existing regional imbalances in employment and industrial capabilities between Member States (Gaddi and Garbellini 2019). These tasks cannot be delegated to green financial markets, but require an actual industrial plan—which, so far, is missing. Finally, the industrial plan must include tougher (national) regulation and standards. Regulation should not be regarded as a cost, a hindrance or an obstruction. This is a very static view, and a view which neglects the potential “technology-forcing” impacts of norms, rules, standards which may well force firms to become more innovative; the EU should use this potential in support of the climate transition.\n\nGreening the Economy Will Not Lower Living Standards …..\n\nThe EU’s Bismarckian approach to the Green Deal is best illustrated by the following comment by European Commissioner Josep Borrell, a leading Spanish social democrat:\n\n“I would like to know if young people demonstrating in Berlin calling for measures against climate change are aware of what such measures will cost them” [….] “and if they are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, because if we fight against climate change for real, they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidized.”\n\nMr. Borrell’s comment brings out the Commission’s view that the massive investments needed for the climate transition can only be financed by raising taxes on and lowering living standards of ordinary citizens. This argument is not just bereft of any political vision or plan, but it is also disingenuous, because it is supposes (and wrongly so) that there are no other sources than higher income taxes for the 99% to finance the climate investment. If Mr. Borrell’s statement reflects the mood in Brussels, it is indistinguishable from sentiments in Eastern-European Member States, where conservative parties are framing the debate on the climate transition as a hard choice between ‘investments in infrastructure and growth’ versus ‘greening the economy while lowering living standards’. Quite like centre-right politicians in Poland, Hungary and Romania, Mr. Borrell is ignoring the considerable potential for job growth, health co-benefits as well as income growth for ordinary citizens.\n\nBut let me help Mr. Borrell and highlight a couple of realistic sources of funding the Green Deal, which do not put the burden on ordinary people nor give preferential treatment to global private finance:\n\n· Abolishing existing fossil-fuel subsidies of €250 billion per year. This will raise Member States’ government revenue by an estimated €100 billion per year.\n\n· Introducing a tax on carbon of €75 per tonne of CO 2eq . This will generate some €270 billion as annual tax revenue — of which €200 billion can be used to compensate the one-third poorest households, most affected by higher energy prices.\n\n· Raising the rate of corporate profit taxation back to the level of the late 1990s (and being tough on corporate tax evasion). This will raise annual tax revenues by €55 billion. Doing this makes sense: corporations will, without doubt, be major beneficiaries of the Green Deal investment programme and industrial policy.\n\n· Introduce a modest wealth tax to channel some of the mostly unearned capital and wealth gains into the public coffers to fund the Green Deal. This could generate around €175 billion per year for the EU27 as a whole. Note that tax revenues can be increased by a similar amount, even without higher or new taxation, by reducing or eliminating exemptions, loopholes and shelters and reducing (corporate) tax avoidance.\n\nHence, contrary to Mr. Borrell’s claim, the Green Deal could be financed without lowering the living standards of 99% of European citizens. On top of all this, the European Commission can leverage more funding without begging private financiers for money. Pension funds in the EU27 hold assets worth more than €4 trillion. The European Commission could oblige European pension funds to channel (say) one-fourth of their assets (i.e. €1 trillion or €100 billion per year during 2020-30) into officially approved Green Deal activities with the risk-free guarantee of a net return of (say) 4%.\n\nConcluding Observations\n\nInvesting these resources (some €500 billion per year) in renewable energy, housing renovation and public transport will create millions of extra jobs, reduce emissions and save hundreds of thousands of lives — each year. Compared to the €250 billion of annual fossil-fuel subsidies paid by the EU and to the (fossil-fuel caused) negative public health externality of €1 trillion per annum, this package looks like a bargain.\n\nThis is not the mind set in Brussels, unfortunately, where Mr. Borrell and some of his colleagues in the European Commission worry about the need to choose between ‘paying for climate action’ versus ‘maintaining or raising living standards’. The inconvenient truth is that a transition to climate neutrality is a condition for sustainable economic prosperity. A failure to decarbonize and transit to a zero-carbon economy will inflict considerable economic damage, drastically reduce living standards and increase inequality within the EU, as is clearly shown by the scenarios developed in the European Commission’s PESETA III study (2018).\n\nIn addition, when properly managed, this Green Deal would generate massive co-benefits in the form of millions of well-paid jobs, an improved quality of life (because of lower air pollution and lower mortality), and reduced inequalities in mobility, life expectancy, and incomes and wealth. The failure to recognize an existential threat (global warming in this case) for what it is and the incapacity to envision an inclusive strategic response to achieve climate neutrality while improving living standards are, to say the least, not very Bismarckian. We cannot leave it to social democrats such as Mr. Borrell or to conservative governments in Central and Eastern Europe to define ‘what is politically possible’.\n\nDespite of all good intentions, the Commission’s Green Deal (as it is) will not work, because the Commission decided to work with and through (financial) markets, taking what Gabor 2020b has called a “politics as usual, third-way approach that seeks to nudge the market towards decarbonisation.” By choosing to make the Green Deal dependent on global finance, the European Commission itself is closing down all avenues for systemic change through tougher regulation, higher taxation and higher spending, as well as for an ambitious green macroeconomics and green industrial policies, which would enable achieving climate neutrality in a socially and economically inclusive manner. Jeffrey Sachs’ assessment is wrong, in other words: what ails the EU Green Deal is exactly what troubles the Union in general — an absence of social democracy at work. Public finances should be made to work for the common good and be protected from carbon financiers.\n\nPost-script The way the European Union is responding to the covid-19 pandemic, or failing to respond, does not augur well for its Green Deal. The coronavirus crisis response so far was a complete car crash: the request for the one-off issuance of “corona bonds” as a means of European solidarity by the most crisis-struck countries Italy and Spain was rudely rejected by the “frugal four” – Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland – who argued that the issuance of a common debt instrument would punish the ‘frugal’ countries, which (arguably) had ‘saved’ to create sufficient fiscal policy space to respond to the pandemic, but would encourage further fiscal mismanagement by those ‘spend-thrift’ countries which did not. Solidarity creates just moral hazard, is what my compatriot Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch minister of finance, incorrectly claims. As a Dutch citizen, I apologise for the disturbing lack of international solidarity as well as the alarming absence of basic political, historical and economic understanding of the process of European economic unification shown by the Dutch government. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has it right, when saying: “If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d’être to the people. We are at a critical point in European history.” If the Union cannot solve the covid-19 catastrophe in a rational, and therefore solidaristic, manner, the Green Deal will be doomed."

Mr. Yan will speak in Chinese and then, our IR Director, Shelley Bai will translate his comments to English. Go ahead, Mr. Yan.\n\nDinggui Yan -- Founder, Director & Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nHello everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings conference call. Despite the ever-evolving regulatory environment and the economic uncertainties, we made progress on many fronts in 2019. Since our successful listing on NASDAQ in May last year, we have been strategically transforming our business model in order to drive sustainable long-term growth. As you know, we disposed of Jiayin and integrated Geerong, our fintech platforms that committed to connect consumers with financial institutions with use of AI and the big data analysis as a core technology. This critical restructuring streamlined our operations, enhanced our risk management system and accelerated our collaborations with financial institutions.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nIn the second quarter, right after the IPO, we started transitioning funding from in the individual institutions. We are glad to see that 45% of loan originations were funded by institutions in March. So far, we have successfully on board in current institutions and have another 20 institutions in preparation. Our institutional onboarding process was affected by the six-week lock down in China starting in February 2020, due to coronavirus control.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nOur market has been changing rapidly. In the fourth quarter, all of our fintech peer's fiscal challenging of an accelerating decrease in the loan origination volume as a resulting revenue decline. Our fourth quarter results include these challenges in our peer group.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nOur fourth quarter net income was a modest RMB22.6 million. We have taken all necessary actions to reduce expenses, including reduction in promotions lending by increasing our focus on repeat borrowers, closely monitored and prioritized R&D expenses and reduced costs related to loan originations.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nWe expect in the 2020 in an incredibly challenging environment in light of the combined impact from the coronavirus outbreaks, the macroeconomic slowdown and the regulatory developments, which have all adversely affect our industry. Thanks to geographic diversity, most of our clients are outside of the academic center. Due to that and the higher level of repeat customers, we expect the Q1 2020 loan volume to be flat sequentially. The industry risk should be only modestly affected in Q1 and in fact, has returned to pre-virus levels.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nChina appears to have contained the strength of the virus. We have obviously resumed operations. We believe that consumer demand will rebound quickly once the virus is fully contained.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nIn 2020, we will continue to invest in our technology platform and our talent. Our management team is stable, solid and focused. We are in this for long-term growth and are committed to explore and identify opportunities to recognize growth.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nWe have laid out three key initiatives for this year. First, I think our opportunities to drive business growth and expense and scalability of our platform. We are very actively exploring an opportunity to acquire a nationwide online micro-lending license. Several discussions are being planned and we expect a great progress. We will also continue to focus on the transition of funding to institutions. The speed of transition will depend on how quickly the virus crisis subsides.\n\nEven as the coronavirus pandemic spreads globally, China is recovering after six to eight weeks of lockdown for the entire country. Business are reopening and the consumer confidence and spending are gradually recovering. We will have more clarity on economic recovery in the next several months. We remain optimistic.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThe second initiative is to build a strategic partnership with financial institutions, including the possibility of strategic investments. We have identified several partners for potential investments and the cooperation.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThe third initiative is to continue to expand into self-installation in the Latin America, most notably, India, the Philippines, Indonesia and Mexico. We are a financial technology platform company as well as the risk management system, AI-based consumer behavior analytics and operational experience can be easily utilized in this market. Of course, our roadmap for overseas expansion will be dependant on the status of the various [Phonetic] operate in those regions as well.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nWe are geared up to resume growth. We are confident that we can emerge from this challenging period with an agile platform, loyal customers and strong execution.\n\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Chunlin who will offer more details on fourth quarter financial performance. Chunlin, please go ahead.\n\nChunlin Fan -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Mr. Yan and Shelley. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. Before I go into details about our financial results, please note that all numbers presented here are in RMB and the percentage changes are on year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. Our press release contains all the figures and comparisons you need. So I will only highlight some of the key points here.\n\nWe are pleased to have sustained healthy profitability in 2019. Despite rather challenging headwinds, we posted modest net income of RMB22.6 million in the fourth quarter. This result reflects the challenging marketing conditions in an evolving regulatory environment. During the quarter, we decreased outstanding loan balance, reduced the number of investors and reduced number of borrowers. This caused the lower loan origination volume and the resulting in the top line decline. While we wait for further clarification on the regulatory situation, we are managing our business prudently by closely watching our costs and sustaining margins by operating more conservatively and efficiently.\n\nWe shifted our focus to repeat lenders and repeat borrowers. As you know, serving repeat customers is a more cost effective and had less credit risk. We were also able to effectively reduce our sales and the marketing expense and the costs related to loan originations. At the same time, both average investment amount and average borrowing amounts were up significantly. This further reflected our lenders and the borrowers strong confidence in our platform. We also closely monitored and managed R&D expense. We made a significant investments in technology and [Indecipherable] in the first half of 2019.\n\nWith the challenging environment now, we reprioritized R&D expense in Q4, resulting in meaningful reductions. General and administrative expenses were up, but this was mainly due to the increased share-based compensation expense allocated to G&A. In addition, in Q4, we continue to accelerate the transition of funding to institutions and the proportion of institutional funding improved credit.\n\nAs Mr. Yan mentioned earlier, 45% of the loan volume was founded by institutions in March this year. If coronavirus outbreak is fully contained, we expect even more progress. The coronavirus outbreak has adversely impacted our industry. The impact to our business is a modest due to our geographic diversification and our focus on repeat high-quality customers.\n\nLoan volume in Q1 of 2020 should be flat compared to Q4. We have seen some early signs of improvement in recent weeks. As the country reopens, people are returning to work. We hope economic activity will pick up and the consumer spending will reduce. Our balance sheet is solid with RMB122.1 million in cash and equivalents, compared with RMB41.4 million at the end of 2018. This solid cash position will enable us to execute our 2020 strategy and reignite growth.\n\nWith that, let's open the call for questions. Mr. Yan, Mr. Xu, our Chief Risk Officer and I will answer questions. Operator, please go ahead.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Yes. We have a question from the line of Craig Irwin of ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\n\nGood evening or good morning and thanks for taking my questions. The first thing I wanted to ask about is the change, the borrowing base with the virus. Are you seeing any industrywide deterioration credit quality? What's the current delinquency rate on loans and how does that compare to six months ago, a year ago and is this already starting to improve given that I guess where full 90 days after the end of the December fiscal quarter?\n\nXu Yifang -- Director and Chief Risk Officer\n\nThanks. This is Yifang Xu. Amazon take on your question. So in terms of very specific delinquency numbers that we are ready to publish that in our annual report, but we can generally talking about the trending I and the impact coming from the corner pandemic outbreak. So as you mentioned early in your question that we are seeing some adverse impact from this outbreak and we are seeing some somebody something very similar on our business as well. However, overall assessment on impact is modest. So here, how we are approaching this impact from managing our business perspective. First, we are taking a conservative position in terms of new loan generations. We are eliminating our loan growth in our Q1. As a result, you're likely going to see a flat growth in terms of the loan volume in Q1 2020 compared to Q4 2019.\n\nIn addition to that, we are also making a deliberate choice to shifting our loan portfolio toward our repeated borrowers, just to be -- to spend more conservative in terms of risk [Indecipherable] perspective. Secondly, we are seeing some of our customers are truly impacted by the pandemic outbreak. We are rolling out some credit release solutions and -- which is granted on a case-by-case basis. And we are seeing the participation rate is relatively low, due to our geographic diversity. Most of our customers are residing outside of the pandemic center. As a result, we are likely going to see a very limited impact in terms of that -- the loss rates.\n\nBut in the month of February, just as our peers who are started to seeing some impact, due to the lockdown period and the impact on our customers on the repayment as well as some disruptions to our collection operation. As a result, we're seeing some uptick in our delinquency rate and some impact in terms of our collection rate, but good news to report you now is we are seeing early sign of improvement in recent weeks, and we're seeing steadily the numbers rolling back to what the levels seen before the outbreak, and relatively that we are back to the -- in terms of the -- both the delinquency rates and our collection rate way back to the levels before the virus outbreak period time.\n\nCraig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\n\nOkay. My second question is about the first quarter. So the first quarter is done. Today is 1st of April. Can you share with us your cash balance today on April 1 and can you comment whether or not you expect the first quarter to be profitable without the benefit of something like a tax rebate or something like this?\n\nChunlin Fan -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nOkay. Thank you, Craig for your question, and I will take this one. The cash and cash equivalents for the -- as of the end of 2019 is RMB120 million, which is RMB80 million bigger than the number of the end of 2018, and the good thing about our cash position is the net operating cash, but the net cash provided by operating activities is positive in 2019 and for quarter one, due to the loan origination volume, we are aligned with the number for Q4, because it is already April 1 and I can't disclose this number to you already. The loan origination volume for Q1 is at RMB1.2 billion as well. It's exactly the same at the Q4 and -- because the management team has taken measures to manage overall cost structure, and we are going to see a decrease of the operation cost. And the net profit margin will come back to our normal double-digit. That's what I'm expecting.\n\nCraig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\n\nSo normal double-digits in the first quarter or in the second quarter. It's hard to tell, but I would say our net profit margin in fourth quarter last year was not a normal margin, and we are expecting to see it will be normalized in the first quarter or second quarter this year, but it's due largely subject to the containment of the pandemic outbreak. Okay. And I just -- I want to understand this very clearly. So I guess, I'm asking the question again. So in the fourth quarter of 2019, the cash position declined by RMB115 million to RMB122 million. I believe your answer just now, you confirmed that we should be flat or similar on the cash balance to that RMB120 million, RMB122 million exiting the March quarter. Can you just confirm that? I understand that correctly.\n\nChunlin Fan -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYes, I think your understanding is basically correct. As I said, the loan origination volume for Q1 this year was same at Q4 last year. And if you do a very simple calculation, basically the take for the Q1 probably will be a little bit lower than Q4 because in Q1, we increased the portion of the institutional funding to like 27%. That's why the take rate will be a little bit lower, but the key thing here is our operating cost will also be lower because we did some actions to manage our overall cost structure in Q1 this year and this benefit will also be reflected throughout the whole year in 2020. So that's a positive sign.\n\nAs CEO just mentioned, this year, our strategy is to grow the business. So the overall loan origination volume for the full year, we're still trying to grow our business. So that's the bottom line. Yeah.\n\nCraig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\n\nYeah. So then turning to originations using funding from institutional investors, you made huge progress in 2019 despite the challenges as we finish the year. Can you maybe frame out for us what your priorities are in working with institutional investors over the next couple of quarters. Where would you like to be with institutional investors by the end of the year, how many institutions do you think is a reasonable number for us to expect to be participating on your platform? Any other color you can provide would be helpful?\n\nXu Yifang -- Director and Chief Risk Officer\n\nThanks, Craig. It's Yifang again, yes, as you noted early that -- we -- since mid of 2019, we have made a significant in improvement in terms of our shifting our strategy toward having the funding source funded by institution partners and as the numbers pointed out that in the Q1 -- in Q4 2019, we are reporting a 60% -- 16% of our funding -- our loan origination will be funded by our institutional investors, compared to 10% in the prior quarter, which is Q3 2019. And we are seeing steady improvement even during the time period of what we've seen at the beginning of this 2020.\n\nChunlin actually mentioned that number that is pretty exciting earlier, which is in the Q1, we are seeing in a rate of 27% for loans will be coming from institutional investors, and in March, we are seeing 45% of loans from the institution investors. And we are -- in the meantime, we are keeping our total origination flat compared to -- in Q1 2020 compared to Q4 2019. So, so far, we have 10 financial institution partners we are working with fully on board and we have -- again, we are reporting healthy pipelines. We have 20 financial institution partners, which are -- who are under discussions with us and prepared to be onboarded over the next several months. And yes, as the business turns back to normal, our business development teams for our institutional investors are\n\nContinuing to working hardly toward that goal. We are expecting going to have our full transition to institutional investors sometimes during -- in 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, while Mr. Yan were discussing our overall strategies, we are actively exploring opportunities to acquire [Indecipherable] lending license. So we are having several conversations, and we are seeing some purposes and hopefully, we're going to report some good story sometimes soon. In addition to that, we are -- while we are deepening our relationship with our institutional funding sources, we are also seeking building -- seeking to build strategic partnership with financial institutions with the possibilities to build strategic investments. So with all these efforts in place, we are helping in 2020 that we -- our loan origination volume and our loan portfolio will grow.\n\nCraig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\n\nExcellent. Last question if I may, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned multiple international geographies, including countries like the Philippines and South America. Can you maybe frame out for us what the status is of those markets for Jiayin Group? Do you expect a material contribution from any of those markets in 2020? How rapidly do you see them growing for you over the next couple of years?\n\nXu Yifang -- Director and Chief Risk Officer\n\nYeah, one of our initiatives to drive our international strategy is to expand into the Southeast Asia and Latin America, especially the Latin American market. By uptil now and we are taking a close watch on how this pandemic situation is spending worldwide and it's specifically even in China, that impact has been -- or even in China, that impact has somewhat contained and which is kind of having a strong growth for our overall business in terms of international strategy and how few things will be under control and what is the impact -- economic impact from the mid to long-term perspective will -- on the international markets, we are still waiting to see, but on the material side that we can report is that in Indonesia, we have in a trial period of obtaining our license -- peer-to-peer license, that's a material -- that's a milestone that we would like to report on this call that -- that in terms of how soon we can grow the -- how soon we can grow the business and have significantly -- significant expansion on the business, we are still waiting to see.\n\nCraig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Thanks again for taking my questions.\n\nChunlin Fan -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig.\n\nJulia Qian -- Managing Director\n\nThank you.
