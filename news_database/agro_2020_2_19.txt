            "content": "Last November, the Turkish government oversaw the planting of 11 million trees in a single day. One Turkish city broke a world record for the number of trees planted in an hour (303,153 trees). By late January, though, the head of the country’s agriculture and forestry trade union was reporting that most of the trees were already dead, though the government denied those claims.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt’s one illustration of the difficulty of achieving a global goal to grow and conserve a trillion trees as part of the fight against climate change—a goal that got a boost when the World Economic Forum launched a new program in January, called 1t.org, to catalyze and coordinate action. Even Donald Trump, who has rolled back 95 environmental protections so far, said that he wanted to sign onto the campaign. Last week, Republican lawmakers proposed that the U.S. should plant a trillion trees by 2050. If it works, the impact could be significant. In the U.S., alone, the nonprofit World Resources Institute has calculated that it’s possible to grow 60 billion new trees in the next two decades (the Republican goal of doing a trillion trees domestically, it turns out, isn’t remotely feasible), and those trees could suck up more than half a billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere each year. Globally, a 2019 study estimated that restoring forests with around 1.2 trillion trees could store more than 200 gigatons of carbon. While some have questioned that study’s math, what’s clear is that the number is massive. Of course, it’s only one part of the solution to climate change. Some scientists have argued that mass tree-planting and conservation is a dangerous diversion if it means that countries aren’t steeply reducing emissions from fossil fuels, the biggest lever in addressing the problem. But even the most radical scenarios for stopping climate change also call for so-called “negative emissions technologies,” something that can pull some excess carbon from the air–something like trees. “We’ve never said that this is the solution to the climate challenge,” says Justin Adams, the director of the Tropical Forest Alliance at the World Economic Forum. “But we’re saying that this is one of the critical transitions we need.” But doing it at the scale of a trillion trees will be—unsurprisingly—very challenging to pull off. You have to stop subtracting before you can add The first problem: The world is still losing a U.K.-sized chunk of forest each year. In 2014, a huge coalition of companies and governments pledged to cut the loss of forests in half by this year, and restore 150 million hectares of land. Last year, they reported that the goal wasn’t on track. Even as many companies work to make sure that their supply chains aren’t contributing to deforestation, tropical forests are still disappearing for the sake of hamburgers or shampoo. In places like the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, there’s still an economic incentive to cut trees down. In Southeast Asia, farmers are still clearcutting jungle to grow palm oil. And even as some multinational corporations are starting to source it sustainably, other plantations may be selling to less scrupulous buyers in China. Keeping existing trees is even more important than planting more. “We really need to focus on protecting our existing forest first, especially primary forest,” says Jared Messinger, manager of the Global Restoration Initiative at the World Resources Institute. “Trees obviously take a long time to mature. And so when you’re cutting down standing forests that are already contributing to carbon removal and replacing them with saplings and others that will take 40 years or more to mature, the level of removal just isn’t the same.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhen new trees are planted—or when degraded land is protected so forests can begin to naturally regenerate—people also need an incentive to keep those trees standing. Any restoration effort has to start with the people who live nearby. “Decisions around land use are inherently local,” Messinger says. “You can have incentives created at the federal level and policy set, but you’re actually trying to change behavior about how people use land. So you have to meet people where they are: Engage them and make sure that it’s in their interest.” In some cases, that might mean creating new businesses and new sources of income. In Peru, for example, one business helps poor farmers make more money by replanting high-value trees on degraded land, and then slowly and sustainably harvesting wood. In another project, coffee farmers earn money by restoring and protecting forests, which in turn helps protect their farms from erosion. In Zimbabwe, new beekeeping businesses have an incentive to keep trees standing because it helps their hives produce more honey. Let the trees grow themselves In some cases, forests may be able to regrow essentially on their own. At the edge of the Amazon rainforest, land that was cleared for cattle ranching can be partially fenced off, so cattle don’t eat young saplings, and trees will begin to return—one of the cheapest and easiest ways to restore forests. In other cases, trees need to be planted. But it needs to happen the right way, with trees chosen that can survive in the area and planting that happens at the right time (in the case of the tree planting in Turkey, part of the problem was likely timing and a lack of rain). Often, trees will need support to survive. In China, most of the trees in a massive “Great Green Wall” campaign designed to fight erosion failed in part because the trees weren’t suited for the area. “Monitoring the efforts is incredibly important, and also resource-intensive and time consuming,” Messinger says. “That’s where we’ve seen a lot of planning efforts fail, because they haven’t put enough effort or resources into the stewardship of those trees.” In the U.S., when World Resources Institute mapped where trees could be restored without interfering with land needed for farming, it found that 21 billion trees could be planted on land that was historically forest. Another 24 billion trees could be “restocked” in forests used for in the Eastern U.S. On cattle pastures, there’s room to add 13 billion trees, which have the added benefit of offering shade, improving soil fertility, and extra income for farmers if the trees grow fruit or nuts. On some other farms, 2 billion trees can be added between row crops. In cities, there’s room for 400,000 more trees, which can help improve air quality and make city dwellers happier. Money grows trees It will take investment: The nonprofit estimates that planting 60 billion trees will cost at least $4 billion a year to finish the campaign within 20 years. But for context, that’s comparable to what the country spends on fossil fuel subsidies now. New government incentives could create a new tree-planting industry similar to the solar industry, where companies help landowners quickly plant and maintain trees. Government tax credits or payments could go to one of these companies—or a land trust or local government—who could negotiate contracts with landowners, take advantage of the government incentive, and then help quickly scale up restoration faster than landowners could do alone.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs tree planting and conservation efforts happen, the world will need to be able to track those trees—something else that isn’t easy to do now, though technology continues to improve. One startup now uses a combination of drones and satellite images to track how trees grow and how much carbon they’re storing. As more and more companies want to buy carbon offsets from forest projects, the World Economic Forum is also figuring out how that can happen effectively. “The working group that we’re setting up will look at what is a credible commitment, so that you’re not just saying, ‘Well, we planted 10 trees and that means that we’re a good company,’ and what’s credible in terms of your overall pathway to net zero, given that climate is the core rationale for this,” Adams says. Though the details are complicated, Adams says that the simplicity of the basic goal is clearly resonating. “It can mobilize and inspire, whether you’re a school kid or you’re the president of a country,” he says. “That’s a big part of what we’re trying to bottle, and now we’re scrambling to really sort of figure out what are the workstreams that need to be in place to actually measure those commitments, track progress against those, so that by . . . next year, we will be able to talk more explicitly about how that would all work.”"

            "content": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nTen billion dollars - or £7.7bn - sounds like a serious amount of money.\n\nIt's how much the world's richest man Jeff Bezos has said he'll spend to fight climate change.\n\nBut what do you even spend $10bn on? And is it anywhere near enough?\n\nAccording to Professor Elizabeth Robinson from the University of Reading, some of the solutions are known about but \"are still not happening\".\n\nCleaner energy\n\nElizabeth, an expert in environmental economics, suggests the money could be spent on persuading governments to stop funding fossil fuels - which produce carbon dioxide and warm the planet.\n\n\"We need to start investing in clean energy instead like renewable. If we do that, we're a lot of the way there.\"\n\nThe UK government announced a deal last year with the wind industry to ensure 30% of electricity comes from offshore wind by 2030.\n\nSeamus Garvey, an energy storage expert at the University of Nottingham, agrees that renewable energy is key.\n\nHe says the technology is available but it needs to be \"made cheaper\" for people to use. \"It's about flexibility in electricity.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wind turbines are seen as an alternative to fossil fuels\n\nSeamus suggests the need to mix wind and solar energy so it works all year long.\n\n\"Wind is very seasonal and blows strongly in the winter - as Storm Dennis has shown us. Solar is also seasonal and the sun shines mostly in the summer. So we need to balance it out.\"\n\n'Invest in transport'\n\nThere's lots of talk around the impact of cars and planes on the environment, so Elizabeth suggests money needs to be spent upgrading transport systems.\n\n\"We need to start investing in affordable low-cost public transport so people choose to move out of their cars and into trains.\"\n\nShe adds that subsidising long-distance public transport to make it \"affordable and reliable\" means people may \"choose to not fly\".\n\n\"We need alternatives - people living in mainland Europe can often take the train to wherever they want to go.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly\n\nSome people choose to do something called carbon offsetting - paying extra to contribute to environmental projects that reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\nSeamus calls this \"a good thing in principle, but not enough in practice\".\n\n\"If we were to do proper carbon offsetting, we would be paying a lot of money.\"\n\nElizabeth says that while she doesn't \"begrudge anyone getting on a flight for a holiday or to see family\", the only way to really make a difference is \"to fly less\".\n\n'Protect our forests'\n\nTargeting key areas that are good for the environment can help too, Elizabeth says.\n\n\"To protect our forests we need to do things like rewilding and planting trees where it makes sense to plant trees.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Forest fires have increased in the Amazon rainforest\n\nAnd, she believes, agriculture needs to be developed too because it \"contributes a large proportion\" of emissions globally.\n\n\"We have to eat - but we need to find ways to do agriculture and forestry better.\"\n\nAccording to Elizabeth, there are \"technological solutions\" for growing crops which can make removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \"more efficient\".\n\nBut is $10bn enough?\n\nJeff Bezos is the boss of Amazon - one of the world's biggest companies - and in 2018 its corporate carbon footprint was 44.4 million metric tons.\n\n\"Which is a lot, like a small country,\" says Seamus.\n\n\"Jeff Bezos can't solve climate problems with $10bn on its own. It could be significant, but it's not enough to even transition the energy in the UK.\"\n\nSeamus says the money \"could kickstart\" other companies which are able to help - after the Amazon founder said he would finance work by scientists, activists and other groups.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon has been previously criticised for its lack of action in tackling climate change\n\nElizabeth says big companies like Amazon have a \"moral obligation\" to tackle climate change.\n\n\"They're making huge profits. So it wouldn't really be that hard.\"\n\nIn a statement to Radio 1 Newsbeat, Amazon said its \"vision\" was to \"make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with 50% of all shipments net zero by 2030\".\n\nIt added: \"Amazon's sustainability team is using a science-based approach to develop data and strategies to ensure a rigorous approach to our sustainability work.\n\n\"We have launched several major and impactful programmes and are working hard to integrate this approach fully across Amazon.\"\n\nLooking worldwide\n\nLower income countries which aren't as developed usually have higher levels of fossil fuels.\n\nElizabeth says money should be used to help those countries develop and move away from damaging fuels.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Boosting the world's ecosystem would help tackle climate change, says Elizabeth\n\n\"That's where some of that $10bn could have a real impact. Those countries are under pressure to reduce poverty and grow economically, and they're using dirty energy to do that. So finding a way to develop without using those would be helpful.\"\n\nAnd is it just about the money?\n\n\"It's about having a commitment as well,\" says Elizabeth.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

And so it stands to reason that, over the next 10,000 years, we'll continue finding ways to combine water and yeast with some kind of sweetener and a floral bittering agent, whether out of some adherence to tradition, or just to take the edge off of after a long day of galactic work.\n\nOver at Tor.com, novelist Arkady Martine, author of the celebrated space-opera A Memory Called Empire, decided to take the thought of space beer and follow it all the way to its logical potential ends. How, exactly, would one be able to brew beer in the confines of a spaceship, using only the basic knowledge that we currently possess around the science of agriculture and fermentation?\n\nIngredients necessary for beer: water, yeast, and a starch that the yeast can work upon. Ingredients you want if you’d like your beer to taste vaguely like the beer we know: malted barley, hops. Let’s start with yeast. The usual yeast is a brewer’s yeast, most often Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which happens—helpfully—to be the same species as the yeast that makes bread rise. Yeasts are little live creatures—single-celled microorganisms that love to eat sugars and transform them into carbon dioxide and alcohol. They need to be kept alive. A generation ship would have had to bring a yeast colony, perhaps in the form of a sourdough starter, and feed it regularly with starches and sugars, in order to be able to have a steady supply of small organisms to brew beer with. As the generation ship matured as an ecosystem of its own, it might develop airborne yeast strains that could be harvested—but it also might not, as the usual air-purifying filters of a spaceship would kill those off. So, to have beer (and bread), the dwellers on our hypothetical ship probably have to keep their yeasts going generation after generation, in some sort of Yeast Vat. Okay. Plausible. Next: water. If our generation ship isn’t producing adequate water supplies, we have bigger problems than a lack of beer. Let’s assume there’s enough water.\n\nMartine keeps going, of course, and continues to impressively and practically extrapolate about the efficiencies and effectiveness of various hydroponics, enzyme growths, and other issues that intergalactic brewers might face.\n\nIt's a short read, but it's fascinating.\n\nHow to Brew Beer in the Confines of a Generation Ship [Arkady Martine / Tor.com]"

Aerial spraying of pesticides is the most effective way of fighting the swarms but countries in the region do not have the right resources.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How East Africa is battling devastating locust swarms\n\nThere are now fears that the locusts - already in the hundreds of billions - will multiply further.\n\n'Reconnaissance mission'\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said about 2,000 adult insects had entered South Sudan via Uganda into the southern county of Magwi.\n\n\"These are deep yellow, which means that they will be here mostly looking at areas in which they will lay eggs,\" the AFP news agency quotes FAO South Sudan representative Meshack Malo as saying.\n\nAgriculture Minister Onyoti Adigo Nyikuac said the government was training people to spray.\n\n\"Also we need chemicals for spraying and also sprayers. You will also need cars to move while spraying and then later if it becomes worse, we will need aircraft,\" he said, AFP reports.\n\nAbout 60% of South Sudan's population is facing food insecurity - and destruction of harvests by locusts could lead to a drop in nutrition levels in children, rights group Save the Children warns.\n\nMore world's newest nation, South Sudan:\n\nEven without the locusts, the charity expects that more than 1.3 million children aged under five will suffer from acute malnutrition this year.\n\nThe FAO says the insects, which eat their own body weight in food every day, are breeding so fast that numbers could grow 500 times by June.\n\nThe UN body last week called on the international community to provide nearly $76m (£58m) to fund the spraying of the affected areas with insecticide.\n\nSomalia has declared a national emergency in response to the crisis.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has called for \"immediate action\" to deal with the problem affecting four of the country's nine states.\n\nKenya has deployed aircrafts to spray pesticides in several regions and its Agriculture Minister Peter Munya said on Monday that the invasion was \"under control\".\n\nMeanwhile, Uganda has deployed soldiers to the northern regions to spray pesticides in the affected areas.\n\nThe locust swarms entered Africa from Yemen three months ago."

Support to each FPO be continued for 5 years from its year of inception.\n\nBenefits\n\nSmall and marginal farmers do not have economic strength to apply production technology, services and marketing including value addition. Through formation of FPOs, farmers will have better collective strength for better access to quality input, technology, credit and better marketing access through economies of scale for better realization of income.\n\nBrief of the Scheme:\n\nA new Central Sector Scheme titled \"Formation and Promotion of Farmer Produce Organizations (FPOs)\" to form and promote 10,000 new FPOs with a total budgetary provision of Rs. 4496.00 crore for five years (2019-20 to 2023-24) with a further committed liability of Rs. 2369.00 crore for period from 2024-25 to 2027-28 towards handholding of each FPO for five years from its aggregation and formation.\n\nInitially there will be three implementing Agencies to form and promote FPOs, namely Small Farmers Agri-business Consortium (SFAC), National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). States may also, if so desire, nominate their Implementing Agency in consultation with DAC&FW.\n\nDAC&FW will allocate Cluster/States to Implementing Agencies which in turn will form the Cluster Based Business Organization in the States.\n\nFPOs will be formed and promoted through Cluster Based Business Organizations (CBBOs) engaged at the State/Cluster level by implementing agencies. The CBBOs will have five categories of specialists from the domain of Crop husbandry, Agri marketing / Value addition and processing, Social mobilisation, Law & Accounts and IT/MIS.These CBBOs will be platform for an end to end knowledge for all issues in FPO promotion.\n\nThere will be a National Project Management Agency (NPMA) at SFAC for providing overall project guidance, data compilation and maintenance through integrated portal and Information management and monitoring.\n\nInitially the minimum number of members in FPO will be 300 in plain area and 100 in North East & hilly areas. However, DAC&FW may revise the minimum number of membership based on experience/need with approval of Union Agriculture Minister.\n\nPriority will be given for formation of FPOs in aspirational districts in the country with at least one FPO in each block of aspirational districts.\n\nFPOs will be promoted under \"One District One Product\" cluster to promote specialization and better processing, marketing, branding & export by FPOs.\n\nThere will be a provision of Equity Grant for strengthening equity base of FPOs.\n\nThere will be a Credit Guarantee Fund of up to Rs. 1,000.00 crore in NABARD with equal contribution by DAC&FW and NABARD and Credit Guarantee Fund of Rs.500.00 crore in NCDC with equal contribution by DAC&FW and NCDC for providing suitable credit guarantee cover to accelerate flow of institutional credit to FPOs by minimizing the risk of financial institutions for granting loan to FPOs.\n\nStates/UTs will be allowed to avail loan at prescribed concessional rate of interest under Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund (AMIF) approved for set up in NABARD for developing agriculture marketing and allied infrastructure in GrAMs, by making marketing & allied infrastructure including Common Facilitation Centre / Custom Hiring Centre for FPOs as eligible category for providing assistance to States / UTs.\n\nAdequate training and handholding will be provided to FPOs. CBBOs will provide initial training. Professional training of CEO / Board of Directors / Accountant of FPOs will be provided in organizational training, resource planning, Accounting / management, marketing, processing etc in reputed National / Regional training Institutes.\n\nBackground\n\nThe report of 'Doubling of Farmer's Income (DFI)' has emphasized this fact and recommended formation of 7,000 FPOs by 2022 towards convergence of efforts for doubling the farmers' income. In the Union Budget 2019-20, Government has announced creation of 10,000 new FPOs to ensure economies of scale for farmers over the next five years, for which a dedicated supporting and holistic scheme as Central Sector Scheme is proposed for targeted development of FPOs and its sustainability.\n\n*****\n\nVRRk/SC"

We are not at all prepared.\"\n\nEast Africa's regional expert group, the Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC), warned Tuesday that eggs laid across the migratory path will hatch in the next two months, and will continue breeding as the rainy season arrives in the region.\n\nThis will coincide with the main cropping season and could cause \"significant crop losses... and could potentially worsen the food security situation\", ICPAC said in a statement.\n\n- 'Panic mode' -\n\nSince 2018 a long period of dry weather followed by a series of cyclones that dumped water on the region created \"excessively ideal conditions\" for locusts to breed, says Gujadhur.\n\nNevertheless, governments in East Africa have been caught off guard and are currently in \"panic mode\" Gujadhur said.\n\nThe locusts arrived in South Sudan this week after hitting Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda.\n\nDesert locusts take over on a dizzying scale.\n\nOne swarm in Kenya reached around 2,400 square kilometres (about 930 square miles) -- an area almost the size of Moscow -- meaning it could contain up to 200 billion locusts.\n\n\"A swarm that size can consume food for 85 million people per day,\" said Gujadhur.\n\nUgandan authorities are aware that subsequent waves of locusts may pose problems in the weeks to come, but in the meantime they are attempting to control the current generation.\n\nGujadhur is quick to praise the \"quite strong and very quick\" response from the Ugandan government but is concerned that while the army can provide valuable personnel, a military-led response may not be as effective as is necessary.\n\n\"It needs to be the scientists and (agriculture officials) who take the lead about where the control operations need to be and how and when and what time,\" she said.\n\n- 'They eat anything green' -\n\nThe soldiers have been working non-stop for two days, criss-crossing the plains on the few navigable roads, trying to keep up with the unpredictable swarms.\n\nMajor General Kavuma recognises that the biggest threat is from the eggs which are yet to hatch but is confident the army will be able to control this enemy.\n\n\"We have the chemicals to spray them, all we need is to map the places they have been landing and sleeping,\" he said.\n\n\"In two weeks time we will come back and by that time they will have hatched and that will be the time to destroy them by spraying.\"\n\nBack in Lopei village, Elizabeth Namoe, 40, a shopkeeper in nearby Moroto had been visiting family when the swarm arrived.\n\n\"When the locusts settle they eat anything green, the animals will die because they have nothing to feed on, then even the people (will suffer),\" she said.\n\n\"The children will be affected by hunger and famine since all life comes from all that is green. I fear so much.\""

Suddenly, many mutual fund investors are thinking of diversifying and include at least one international fund in their mutual fund portfolio. However, mutual fund managers and advisors are asking investors to proceed cautiously.The international fund category has offered 14.40% returns in the last one year, 8.68% in three years and 6.34% in five years. The top 6 schemes in this category have given above 25% returns in the last one year. A close look at the category shows that the top ten schemes follow different investment strategy . They invest in diverse markets, commodities, and have disparate investment mandates.Here are the top 10 schemes on the 1-year return chart and where they invest:“International fund category is a highly diverse category. Investors shouldn’t make the mistake of chasing returns in such schemes,” says Raunak Onkar, international fund manager, PPFAS. “It is a high-risk category. Apart from having a high risk-appetite, investors should also be aware to sail through the volatility in such schemes,” adds Raunak Onkar.Onkar manages the overseas investment in Parag Parikh Long Term Equity Fund that manages assets worth Rs 2,784 crore as on Jan 31st, 2020. The scheme has offered 17.12% returns in the last one year.Puneet Oberoi, Founder, Excellent Investment Advisors, says that even if you are an aggressive investor, you shouldn’t pick any scheme in the international fund category randomly to diversify your investments. Raunak Onkar also agrees with him. “We can say we need another re-categorisation exercise for this category. The category has funds across geographies and themes. But all of this is in one basket. There are world gold funds, world agriculture funds, China-centric funds, EM centric funds etc. So, choosing schemes on the basis of returns can hurt investors very badly,” Raunak Onkar says.Mutual fund advisors say investors who are interested to geographically diversify their investments by investing in overseas schemes should stick to safer funds if they don’t know much about the world markets.“In the international fund category, there are schemes that track NASDAQ and the broader US and European markets. These schemes are easy to track and not very volatile,” says Puneet Oberoi. He warns against focusing solely on returns and getting into risky overseas funds. “Many investors get into the toppers on the charts which can be a China fund or a commodities fund. This can be dangerous.”Raunak Onkar says if an investor is going to invest on the basis of returns alone, s/he would choose a China fund. However, an intelligent investor will not risk investing in such a scheme when coronavirus threat is on. He believes that smaller markets like Germany, Brazil etc are difficult to track in comparison to the USA. That’s why many mutual fund advisors like Puneet Oberoi suggest only the USA-centric funds to their clients.Mutual fund advisors also believe that regular investors should avoid funds that focus on smaller markets also due to the corporate governance issues. “Many a times, markets like India, China, Brazil outperform USA’s developed market. However, investors need to understand that you are diversifying to avoid the issues in the Indian markets. Emerging markets have similar governance issues. In this case, investing in a high-yielding Vietnam fund wouldn’t help you,” says Raunak Onkar. He adds that Europe and the USA are the two places where companies have high corporate governance standards."

Option shall be given to States/UTs to choose Scale of Finance or district level Value of Notional Average Yield (NAY) i.e. NAY* Minimum Support Price (MSP) as Sum Insured for any district crop combination (Both PMFBY/RWBCIS). Farm gate price will be considered for the other crops for which MSP is not declared. Central Subsidy under PMFBY/RWBCIS to be limited for premium rates upto 30% for unirrigated areas/crops and 25% for irrigated areas/crops. Districts having 50% or more irrigated area will be considered as irrigated area/district (Both PMFBY/RWBCIS). Flexibility to States/UTs to implement the Scheme with option to select any or many of additional risk covers/features like prevented sowing, localised calamity, mid-season adversity, and post-harvest losses. Further, States/UT can offer specific single peril risk/insurance covers, like hailstorm etc, under PMFBY even with or without opting for base cover (Both PMFBY/RWBCIS). States not to be allowed to implement the Scheme in subsequent Seasons in case of considerable delay by States in release of requisite Premium Subsidy to concerned Insurance Companies beyond a prescribed time limit. Cut-off dates for invoking this provision for Kharif and Rabi seasons will be 31st March and 30th September of successive years respectively (Both PMFBY/RWBCIS). For estimation of crop losses/admissible claims, two-Step Process to be adopted based on defined Deviation matrix\" using specific triggers like weather indicators, satellite indicators, etc. for each area along with normal ranges and deviation ranges. Only areas with deviations will be subject to Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) for assessment of yield loss (PMFBY). Technology solutions like Smart Sampling Technique (SST) and optimization of number of CCEs to be adopted in conducting CCEs (PMFBY). In case of non-provision of yield data beyond cut-off date by the States to implementing Insurance Companies, claims to be settled based on yield arrived through use of Technology solution (PMFBY alone). Enrolment under the Scheme to be made voluntary for all farmers (Both PMFBY/RWBCIS). Central Share in Premium Subsidy to be increased to 90% for North Eastern States from the existing sharing pattern of 50:50 (Both PMFBY/RWBCIS). Provisioning of at least 3% of the total allocation for the Scheme to be made by Government of India and Implementing State Governments for administrative expenses. This shall be subject to an upper cap fixed by DAC&FW for each State (Both PMFBY/RWBCIS). Besides above, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare in consultation with other stakeholders/agencies will prepare/develop State specific, alternative risk mitigation programme for crops/areas having high rate of premium. Further, as the scheme is being made voluntary for all farmers, therefore, to provide financial support and effective risk mitigation tools through crop insurance especially to 151 districts which are highly water stressed including 29 which are doubly stressed because of low income of farmers and drought, a separate, scheme in this regard would also be prepared. The concerned provisions/parameters of scheme and operational guidelines of the PMFBY and RWBCIS shall be modified to incorporate the above said modifications and shall be made operational from Kharif 2020 season.\n\nBenefits\n\nWith these changes it is expected that farmers would be able to manage risk in agriculture production in a better way and will succeed in Stabilizing the farm income. Further, it will increase coverage in north eastern region enabling farmers of NER to manage their agricultural risk in a better way. These changes will also enable quick and accurate yield estimation leading to faster claims settlement.\n\nThese changes are proposed to be implemented from Kharif’ 2020 Season throughout the Country.\n\n******\n\nVRRK/SC"

REUTERS\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will on Wednesday launch the first of a raft of proposals to help European companies exploit their rich trove of industrial data and at the same time rein in online giants Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com Inc .\n\nThe data strategy and artificial intelligence discussion papers are part of a bigger scheme to help European companies better compete with U.S. tech giants and state-aided Chinese companies in the digital world.\n\nEuropean digital and antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager and European industry chief Thierry Breton will present the proposals around noon. They will come up with a final draft by the end of the year following feedback from interested parties.\n\nThe core of the EU’s data strategy is the creation of a single European data market and smaller data markets centered on key industries, according to a draft seen by Reuters last month.\n\nOther elements include new rules covering cross-border data use, data interoperability and standards related to manufacturing, climate change, the auto industry, healthcare, financial services, agriculture and energy.\n\nOne of the possibly controversial proposals calls for doing away with EU competition rules against anti-competitive data sharing.\n\nIn response to complaints about the power wielded by large online platforms, the Commission is also considering introducing rules to stop these companies from unilaterally imposing conditions for access and use of data or benefiting from this in a disproportionate manner.\n\nThe discussion paper on artificial intelligence aims to set up a framework to govern the use of this technology used by an increasing number of companies, a draft seen by Reuters showed. The rules would apply to high-risk sectors such as healthcare, transport and predictive policing.\n\nMore onerous rules known as the digital services act, which could force the tech giants to take on more responsibilities for their actions and content hosted on their platforms, are expected to be announced towards the end of the year."

Then this plan is for you.\n\nDigital farming, sometimes called \"precision agriculture\", refers to a technology-enabled approach to monitor and optimise the processes along the agricultural value-chain.\n\nHowever, the report reveals that these innovative practices threaten to turn farmers into \"data harvesters\" - dependent on agribusiness and tech corporations if left unregulated.\n\n\"Unless regulation is brought in, farmers face a dystopian future, abandoned to giant corporations who seek to gain unprecedented control over Europe's fields,\" said food campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, Mute Schimpf, who added that this is \"an avoidable crisis\", where the EU must protect its farmers.\n\nIn 2017, a European Parliament study already pointed out that \"those who own the data can direct and control the data sets, are in the central position of power to create the added value and earn a major share of income generated in agriculture\".\n\nIn the last decade, investment levels have significantly increased in the digital farming sector, with this market expected to reach over €10bn by 2025.\n\nHowever, according to campaigning NGO, the key players in the digital farming market - Bayer/Monsanto, DuPont/Dow, Syngenta/ChemChina, BASF - have a long record of pushing environmentally-harmful industrial agriculture in the EU.\n\n\"We are watching an agricultural digital arms race where the winner will dominate and control our food, countryside, and the farmers that feed us,\" Schimpf warned.\n\nDigital dependency?\n\nThe European Parliament has previously acknowledged that there is a \"high risk\" that European farming becomes dependent on non-European companies for digital farming, what may lead to \"anti-competitive practices including price discrimination and speculations in commodity markets that may affect food security\".\n\nThis presents a challenge for the commission, which wants to reduce such dependencies along the digital value chain, according to a draft of the European Data Strategy seen by EUobserver, which is to be published on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, according to Friends of the Earth Europe, the commission's regulatory approach is unlikely to propose rules to govern the fast-developing digitalisation of farming - despite their potential harm for the objectives of the Green Deal.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU Court of Auditors recently called on the commission to improve to use of new technologies for monitoring environmental requirements and develop further action plans under the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP)."

Dutch farmers, some driving tractors, poured into The Hague on Wednesday to protest government moves to rein in carbon and nitrogen emissions to better fight climate change. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong)\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Angry Dutch farmers converged on The Hague on Wednesday in the latest protest against the government's plans to rein in emissions of nitrogen oxide.\n\nAs tractors poured into the city, the Dutch military parked large trucks across strategic roads to prevent farmers from driving into the business and shopping center. Organizers said they expect thousands to attend a rally in the city.\n\nThe demonstration comes a day before a debate in parliament on how to rein in emissions of the pollutant nitrogen oxide. Farmers believe they are being disproportionately targeted by lawmakers, saying that aviation, construction and other industries also are major polluters.\n\n“Take the time to give the sector a chance to use far more effective ways to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide, which we’ve already been doing for years,” said Ype Reinsma, a farmer from the northern province of Friesland.\n\n“Why is everything aimed at the farmers?” he added.\n\nPolice issued tickets to a small number of farmers across the Netherlands for driving their tractors on highways and police in The Hague arrested a 33-year-old protester for ignoring their instructions and creating “a dangerous situation on the road.”\n\nIn October last year, thousands of farmers, many driving tractors, descended on The Hague, causing traffic chaos across the country. Far fewer tractors appeared to take part in Wednesday's protest and traffic authorities said that it did not create major problems on the country's roads.\n\nAmong measures being considered by the government are a multi-million euro fund to buy out farmers who voluntarily want to close their farms and moves to encourage modernization of farms.\n\n“I hope that some ministers wake up and take action and not promise all sorts of things and then do nothing as happened last time. It can’t continue this way,” said another protester, Wim Westerneng.\n\nFarmers argue that the government’s plans are based on inaccurate readings and calculations by the government-funded National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. New measurements are set to be released on Thursday.\n\nThe Dutch farming lobby is powerful because of the economic significance of agriculture to the economy. The Dutch farmers’ organization, LTO, says exports from the country’s nearly 54,000 farms and agriculture businesses were worth 90.3 billion euros ($98.3 billion) in 2018."

            "content": "WASHINGTON: With no India-US trade deal likely, US officials are beginning to wonder why Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn’t put his thumb on the scale to make it happen in time for President Donald Trump’s visit.Modi has a reputation for being decisive and the PMO is the centre of power, they noted. His government enacted the Citizenship Amendment Act swiftly and ordered demonitisation in record time, both of which were far bigger propositions.Frustration, accumulated over two years of negotiations, is turning into deep dismay at what some are calling the great Indian stalling game. There is a sense that New Delhi was more interested in getting a presidential visit than in hammering out a trade deal.An industry source said that organisers were having a tough time getting American CEOs to go to Delhi for the business event planned for Trump. “The interest is low,” the source said, but efforts are underway.Trump has reportedly been briefed about the status of trade negotiations but so far he hasn’t commented on Twitter. Some officials wonder whether Modi is getting a “true picture” of what prevented the deal from materializing.An administration official said a failure to firm up a trade deal in time for the visit would be “bad, very bad.” Another called it a “setback.” The disappointment is feeding into the narrative that India is not serious about trade while Bangladesh is doing a better job of getting into global supply chains.But there are two sides to the story. Indian sources say that US domestic politics may have entered the picture with Washington trying to push products that would help farmers and manufacturers in “swing states” with an eye on the 2020 election. New items were suddenly being promoted.The US also took steps before the Trump visit that can hardly be considered friendly. It declared India a “developed” country last week, making it ineligible for preferential treatment in certain global trade practices.When asked about the timing of the US decision, a US insider agreed it would have been better to wait until after Trump’s visit. But he said it was long in the works and not aimed solely at India.That’s hardly solace to New Delhi because that’s a standard US explanation for all punitive measures taken by the Trump Administration.Indian officials stress that India has relented on several issues and there is agreement on most things on the table – medical devices, chicken legs, dairy and agricultural products. India also agreed to import $6.5 billion worth of US goods in exchange for restoration of GSP privileges. The idea was to increase Indian imports of US oil and gas but that didn’t work because US officials wanted to dictate how India should spend the $6.5 billion.Last week US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer cancelled a planned trip to New Delhi because he reportedly lost patience at the lack of progress. What exactly triggered the trip cancellation is not known but it might have had something to do with the US demand that US credit card companies be treated under the same rules as Indian companies. The Indian side considers the demand audacious.A major problem during the endless negotiations has been the relative power of negotiators. While Lighthizer is fully empowered to speak for the US administration, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal apparently is not. Things have got delayed several times because certain aspects had to be cleared by the agriculture or finance ministry, adding to the frustration."

Cotton active futures at ICE plunged by over 6 percent since the first half of January.\n\nCottonseed prices in physical markets, which had just started to move close to its MSP declared for 2019-20 season (Rs 5,550 per quintal for long staple), again declined below the threshold as demand for the fibre hit the road-block due to Covid-19.\n\nAs per a Business Standard article, one of India's top cotton exporters had halted cotton shipments to China amid concerns of coronavirus spread in the country. Prospects of lower exports and concerns over reduced demand by China as the country will be mired in dealing with the epidemic for some time now, have dented sentiments in all the major agriculture commodities, especially in which China plays a major role in global demand.\n\nA respite was received from Cotton Corporation of India's (CCI) statement that they may procure cotton beyond its initial target of 100 lakh bales if the prices continued to reel under pressure. CCI also showed readiness to procure entire cotton crop produced by country's farmers if need be. As on first half of February, CCI had procured around 61 lakh bales of cotton so far.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiments is news coming from Chinese official that they would accept application for new tariffs exemption for nearly 700 United States' products (including many agriculture commodities) from March 2nd.\n\nThough positive cues from international market as US-China are closing in to end their over a year-long trade impasse and falling supply of cotton in domestic market augurs well for recovery in cotton prices from lower levels, apprehension of proliferating deadly coronavirus still looms large in the market. Hence, we are cautiously bullish On natural fibre for the medium-term unless situation of coronavirus spread doesn't get too ugly.\n\n(The author is VP- Head Commodity Research at Kotak Securities.)\n\n: The views and investment tips expressed by investment expert on moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

Mr Somkid asked Jetro to offer technical support and coordinate with large Japanese firms to provide farm-related technology and machinery to the Thai farm sector.\n\nHe said technology and machines such as drones, harvesters and smart tractors could help the agriculture sector cut costs and increase productivity.\n\nFinance Minister Uttama Savanayana said the BAAC is extending 20 billion baht in loans with a low interest rate this year to support smart farmers, community businesses and agricultural cooperatives in developing their businesses and upgrading production.\n\nThe loans are also for farmers to buy machinery to replace human labour.\n\nBAAC president Apirom Sukprasert said the bank will cooperate with large companies, the Board of Investment and the National Village and Urban Community Fund to develop smart farmers, community businesses and agriculture cooperatives.\n\nCommunity development is expected to drive the local economy this year to offset the global economic slowdown and the impact of the coronavirus on tourism.\n\nMr Apirom said farmers under the lending scheme can receive an interest rate of the minimum retail rate (MRR) minus one percentage point. The loans are for buying machinery and accessories and to pay for maintenance.\n\nThe bank's MRR stands at 6.875%.\n\nIf farmers are already making instalment payments on machinery from either company, they can participate through refinancing.\n\nApplications for the loan scheme will be taken until March 31, 2023. The entire loan amount should be doled out within two years, Mr Apirom said."

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Indian sugar millers, saddled with record stockpiles, are eager to cash in on the prospect of resuming exports to Indonesia after being absent from the world’s top import market for years.\n\nThe nation, which vies with Brazil as the top producer, may sell 250,000 tons of raw sugar to Indonesia by the end of the local crushing period in May after a change in quality rules by the Southeast Asian country, according to the median of six estimates in a Bloomberg survey of traders and officials.\n\nIndia is returning to Indonesia after a severe drought cut production in Thailand, normally the main supplier of raw sugar to the country. The new export market may help rein in India’s ballooning reserves, which surged to a record of more than 14 million tons on Oct. 1 after bumper harvests.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity for us to export sugar to Indonesia,” said Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd., a producers’ group. “Mills just need to shut white sugar production and start making raws in the next two months before the crushing season gets over.”\n\nIndonesia changed the color specification for raw sugar imports to allow shipments from India, Kasdi Subagyono, director general of estate crops at the Agriculture Ministry said Monday. The government halved the ICUMSA measure to 600, Subagyono said, adding Indonesia needs sugar to meet rising household consumption. While targeted at India, the lower level applies to all suppliers.\n\nThe ICUMSA is the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis. Most Indian mills make raw sugar with an ICUMSA of as much as 800 and could not ship to Indonesia, which had a level for imported sugar of 1,200.\n\nGlobal Prices\n\nIncreasing exports from India may curb the rise in global prices that have surged about 10% this year on concern about production in No. 2 exporter Thailand, hit with its worst drought in 40 years. Sugar exports from the country could drop about 40% to 6 million tons, according to one industry estimate. Raw sugar futures for May in New York rose 1.2% to 15.05 cents per pound on Wednesday.\n\n“Export contracts have to be signed quickly for mills in Maharashtra and Karnataka to produce raw sugar before crushing ends in about a month,” said Abinash Verma, director general of Indian Sugar Mills Association. “A quick reallocation of export quotas to mills in northern India will help them increase production of raw sugar before crushing ends there in May.”\n\nThe government is considering to transfer export quotas to mills that have exhausted most of their limits and are willing to ship more, from those which are unable to utilize full quotas, the association said on Tuesday. India’s sugar exports may be more than 5 million tons in 2019-20, compared with 6 million tons quota allocated by the government, it said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that Indonesia, the world’s biggest importer of the sweetener, will buy 4.4 million tons of raw sugar in 2019-20.\n\nIndonesian refiners are waiting for an official notification on the ICUMSA rule before entering import contracts with Indian suppliers, said Bernardi Dharmawan, chairman of the Indonesia Sugar Refiners Association, a group of 11 refiners that only process imported raw sugar for industrial users.\n\nIndonesia may buy 300,000 tons from India this year, considering poor supplies from Thailand, he said, adding actual purchases depend on prices.\n\n(Updates to add comment in eighth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Karthikeyan Sundaram.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Pratik Parija in New Delhi at pparija@bloomberg.net;Yoga Rusmana in Jakarta at yrusmana@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anna Kitanaka at akitanaka@bloomberg.net, Atul Prakash, James Poole\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Organizers said they expect thousands to attend a rally in the city.\n\nThe demonstration comes a day before a debate in parliament on how to rein in emissions of the pollutant nitrogen oxide. Farmers believe they are being disproportionately targeted by lawmakers, saying that aviation, construction and other industries also are major polluters.\n\n“Take the time to give the sector a chance to use far more effective ways to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide, which we’ve already been doing for years,” said Ype Reinsma, a farmer from the northern province of Friesland.\n\n“Why is everything aimed at the farmers?” he added.\n\nPolice issued tickets to a small number of farmers across the Netherlands for driving their tractors on highways and police in The Hague arrested a 33-year-old protester for ignoring their instructions and creating “a dangerous situation on the road.”\n\nIn October last year, thousands of farmers, many driving tractors, descended on The Hague, causing traffic chaos across the country. Far fewer tractors appeared to take part in Wednesday’s protest and traffic authorities said that it did not create major problems on the country’s roads.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAmong measures being considered by the government are a multi-million euro fund to buy out farmers who voluntarily want to close their farms and moves to encourage modernization of farms.\n\n“I hope that some ministers wake up and take action and not promise all sorts of things and then do nothing as happened last time. It can’t continue this way,” said another protester, Wim Westerneng.\n\nFarmers argue that the government’s plans are based on inaccurate readings and calculations by the government-funded National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. New measurements are set to be released on Thursday.\n\nThe Dutch farming lobby is powerful because of the economic significance of agriculture to the economy. The Dutch farmers’ organization, LTO, says exports from the country’s nearly 54,000 farms and agriculture businesses were worth 90.3 billion euros ($98.3 billion) in 2018."

The coronavirus outbreak in China has disturbed the supply chain of material,” Prasad Kokil, former chairman of Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture, said.\n\nThe gap in the supply of raw materials can create problems, he said, adding this is a chance to look for substitutes and reduce the dependency on Chinese parts. The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can grab this opportunity, Mr. Kokil said.\n\nCompanies working in solar and energy sector have to import parts from China, solar and energy equipment manufacturer M.P. Sharma said.\n\n“The production of solar items has been impacted, as the supply of raw materials from China has been disrupted. We have found new alternatives in Vietnam and Taiwan,” he said.\n\n“Imported parts make 60% of our products. We need to buy them even if they are 13-15% costlier than Chinese imports,” he said.\n\nOne of the manufacturers who has invested ₹3.5 crore in Chinese machines is unable to get his consignment, as he can’t send anyone to transport the equipment from there, industrialist Sunil Kirdak said.\n\nWhen asked if local MSMEs can profit from this development, Confederation of Indian Industry’s zonal chairman Mukund Kulkarni said it would be highly unlikely as the parts would have to be delivered in a short span of time. “We can make quality parts, but we may not be able to meet the demands in a short span of time. Hence, imports will continue, only the countries we import from will change,” he said."

It is the responsibility of the State governments to make full utilisation of the Central sector funds. The Odisha government should wake up from deep slumber and come forward to take advantage of the schemes,” said Mr. Madhav attacking the Naveen Patnaik government at a press conference here.\n\nStating that one of the important aspects of this year’s Budget was to provide support to the States basing on their performance, he said, “Heavy budgetary allocation has been made in fishery, solar and water resource sectors. If the State government comes up with good proposals, the Centre is ready to provide support.”\n\nHe termed the Union Budget growth oriented. The Budget had given priority to development of critical sectors such as agriculture, water resources and infrastructure and uplift of youth, women and socially and economically backward classes, the BJP leader said, adding that it would help the country come out of the economic slowdown.\n\n“The experience with the Odisha government has not been pleasant one. Instead of making false allegations that it was ignored by the Central government, it must make utmost utilisation of the sanctioned fund. We want to give many projects to Odisha but the State is not ready to take them,” he said. The allegations of decrease in the Central allocation for the State were baseless, said Mr. Madhav."

Amaggi declined to comment, while El Tejar representatives in Brazil didn’t immediately respond.\n\nBrazil -- already the biggest exporter of soybeans, sugar, coffee and meat -- has been expanding agricultural production to tap China’s growing demand for imported food. On Tuesday, Bunge Ltd. said it offered to buy two soybean plants in Brazil.\n\nOwned by the family of former Agriculture Minister Maggi, Amaggi produces grains and cotton on 280,000 hectares. El Tejar’s assets in Brazil would increase its planted area to 350,000 hectares, an area bigger than Rhode Island, strengthening its position in cotton.\n\nFounded in Argentina, El Tejar is controlled by U.S. fund Capital International and U.K.-based Altima Partners. In 2013, the group opted to focus operations in Brazil amid unfavorable policies in Argentina. It grew to be among Brazil’s largest soy producers but then shrunk when a ban on foreign company land purchases added to operational problems.\n\nAmaggi produces more than 1.1 million metric tons of grains and fiber a year and originates around 10 million grains, according to the company’s website.\n\nThe group exported 4 million tons of soybeans, soy meal and corn last year, according to figures from shipping agency Cargonave. It also owns two crushing plants in Brazil and operates a logistical export corridor in the nation’s north.\n\n--With assistance from Cristiane Lucchesi.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Fabiana Batista in Sao Paulo at fbatista6@bloomberg.net;Tatiana Freitas in São Paulo at tfreitas4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

            "content": "Moët Hennessy said all of its own vineyards in Champagne will become free of herbicides in 2020, and that it will also work with contracted growers to help them become more sustainable.\n\nThe group will also invest €20m in a research centre dedicated to sustainable winemaking in Champagne, it announced at last week’s Vinexpo show in Paris.\n\nWhile Moët isn’t the first in Champagne to commit to ending herbicide use in its vineyards – and the group stopped short of announcing a switch to organic farming – its move shows how the issue, and environmental stewardship more broadly, is focusing minds.\n\nMoët, which is the drinks arm of luxury goods group LVMH, said it would also create a network named the ‘university of living soils’ to encourage knowledge sharing.\n\nThe Comité Champagne has previously said it wishes to end herbicide use in the region’s vineyards by 2025, as part of its sustainability plan – which runs alongside the French government’s ‘EcoPhyto’ initiative to make agriculture less reliant on artificial fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides.\n\nBackground: Focus on glyphosate\n\nThere has been particular attention on glyphosate, the active ingredient in some of the most-used herbicides.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron said in 2019 that he wanted the country’s agriculture sector to stop using glyphosate within three years.\n\nGovernment officials have since said that glyphosate will be phased out, beginning in 2020, with the caveat that non-chemical alternatives must exist.\n\nIn December last year, France’s agency for occupational health, food safety and the environment, ANSES, said it was withdrawing licences for 36 products containing glyphosate, and would refuse to approve four new products.\n\nApprovals for the remaining 29 glyphosate herbicides in France were set to be revoked by the end of 2020, the government has since confirmed.\n\nThat could have Europe-wide repercussions, because France is on a four-country panel that is re-assessing glyphosate’s safety at EU level. The ingredient’s current licence runs to 15 December 2022.\n\nSome European wine regions have already ended glyphosate use. The Prosecco DOCG Council banned it in 2018, for example.\n\nSee also:"

(AP Photo/Leo Correa/File)\n\nBrazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday said he was pushing a bill through Congress to allow commercial mining and agriculture on protected indigenous lands, as he met with tribal leaders to announce a credit line to support indigenous farmers who have developed soy plantations on their reservations.\n\nThe far-right leader, who has faced criticism for his government’s failure to protect the Amazon rain forest, said the credit line would allow indigenous tribes to buy seed, fertilizer and machinery, even though large-scale agriculture has hitherto been illegal on their lands.\n\n“Indigenous people cannot be stuck inside their lands like prehistoric human beings,” Bolsonaro said as he met with some 20 indigenous leaders at the gates of the presidential palace.\n\nSpeaking with Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina beside him, Bolsonaro said the credit line would help lift Brazil’s indigenous people out of poverty and assimilate them into Brazilian society.\n\nRead| Brazil indigenous protest new government moves on their lands\n\nThe main organizations representing Brazil’s 900,000 indigenous people say a majority are opposed to mining and commercial agriculture on their ancestral lands, however.\n\nBolsonaro’s comments at the presidential palace came as Raoni Metuktire, a Kayapo chief known internationally for his environmental campaigning since the 1980s, joined other indigenous representatives in an appearance at Brazil’s Congress on Tuesday to ask Speaker Rodrigo Maia to block the government’s commercial mining and farming bill.\n\n“Bolsonaro is clearly trying to create division between us, but the majority of us are represented here and is against the bill,” said Sonia Guajajara, head of APIB, an umbrella organization of the indigenous tribes of Brazil.\n\n“We do not want the destruction of the rainforest with mining and hydroelectric dams. I am against what Bolsonaro is doing,” Raoni told a news conference.\n\nSpeaker Maia said after their meeting that he had put the president’s proposal on the back-burner because it needs far more debate in Brazilian society than the government had allowed.\n\nBolsonaro said his bill will allow indigenous people to mine and plant crops on their lands, and rent them to white farmers if they want to, which is currently illegal under Brazilian law.\n\nEnvironmental laws also ban commercial agriculture and the use of transgenic crops on reservation lands, though three tribes were given a temporary three-year permit to develop large-scale farming that expired in 2018.\n\nOne of the tribes, the Parecis are farming 8,000 hectares of soy this season, and Bolsonaro plans to visit them during the harvest, a source at the indigenous affairs agency Funai said.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But Satpute had died three months before his loan application, raising the question of how could he have applied for it in the first place.\n\nMore:\n\nHis case came to light after a bench of the High Court of Bombay ordered the Economic Offences Wing of the state police to investigate an alleged fraud.\n\nSugar baron\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate, the economic intelligence unit of the central government, raided 10 locations, including properties belonging to sugar baron Ratnakar Gutte, in June 2019 in connection with the bank fraud.\n\nBetween the fiscal years of 2012-2013 and 2016-2017, his company Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Limited (GSEL), located in the town of Gangakhed, took out fraudulent loans worth Rs 578 crores ($80m) from seven public-sector banks in the name of more than 24,000 farmers, according to an audit accessed by Al Jazeera.\n\nFarmer Ramesh Pawar saysÂ fraudulent loans amounting to Rs 5.5 lakhs ($7,704) were issued in his nameÂ [Parth MN/Al Jazeera]\n\nRatnakar Gutte, GSEL chairman, has been in jail since March 2019 for money laundering.Â A bench of the Bombay High Court is hearing the case.\n\nCurrently a member of the state legislature representing the constituency of Gangakhed, made up of farmers his sugar factory allegedly duped, Gutte managed to contest the October 2019 state elections from jail - and win.\n\nIn state elections five years earlier, his Rashtriya Samaj Party was publicly allied with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state.\n\nIn the October 2019 elections, the public alliance was dropped but his campaign posters featured prominent photos of then-chief minister and BJP senior leader Devendra Fadnavis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe BJP's official ally, Shiv Sena, had been contesting the constituency in the election too, but Gutte's team consistently said that he was the real BJP ally throughout the campaign.\n\nGutte's son, Vijay, directedÂ the Bollywood film Accidental Prime Minister, which is said by many to be a hatchet job on the Gandhi family which heads the Indian National Congress, the BJP's main opposition.\n\nTwo top BJP functionaries refused to comment on Gutte. Anil Bonde, who was the agriculture minister in the previous BJP state government, and Ashish Shelar, the BJPâs chief whip in the state assembly, said they were not in a position to speak about him.\n\nAl Jazeera also sent a request to Fadnavis's assistant for a comment from the former chief minister. He replied, inquiring about the \"exact subject\" on the comment being sought. A clarification was sent, after which the assistant stopped responding.\n\nPolitical observers say defending Gutte could land a politician in trouble.\n\n'Fraudulently availed loans'\n\nAfter the raids last June, ED officials told the media that GSEL \"fraudulently availed loans\"Â from different banksÂ in the names of thousands of farmers, \"on the basis of guarantee given by the company\".\n\nA handful of the farmers, like Satpute, were deceased. Those who were alive found themselves in a mess they did not sign up for.\n\nRajebhau Phad, Gutte's son-in-law, calls the case 'politically motivated' [Parth MN/Al Jazeera]\n\nOne day in December 2018, Sulochana Tale, 65, received an envelope on her doorstep.\n\n\"It was a bank notice that asked us to pay up Rs 290,543 ($4,070),\" she says with an amused smile. A year later, she can laugh about it but at the time, her blood pressure shot up.\n\n\"I checked with my husband and even he had no clue what itâs all about. At this age, we can do without such shocks.\" Her lawyer has responded to the notice, and the matter is under judicial consideration.\n\nA few years ago, Tale, who owns five acres (two hectares) of farmland in a village near Gangakhed, had sold the sugarcane she harvested to Gutte's factory.\n\n\"The factory had gotten our details like the plot number, identity card and so on at the time,\" says her husband, Shankar, 71, a retired professor. \"We have no clue how they engineered the entire transaction.\"\n\nModus operandi\n\nThe company's modus operandi of using this information to secure fraudulent loans has been noted in the financial audit of GSEL conducted by the investigation and intelligence wing of the Maharashtra state police.\n\nIt was presented in court in May 2019. The farmers' signatures, as well as the documents required to open their bank accounts and verify their authenticity, \"were forged\", it says.\n\nImmediately after the loan amount was credited to the farmers' accounts, the audit adds, \"almost entire amounts were transferred to the bank account of GSEL with consent of farmers\". Most of those funds, according to the audit, were used for GSEL's \"own benefit\".\n\nThe factory took the fraudulent loan money at a time when Maharashtra is going through one of its worst agrarian crises. At least 11,995 farmers have killed themselves in the state between 2015 and the end of 2018, largely in despair at being unable to repay loans they had taken, owing to droughts and unseasonal rains that impacted their crops.\n\nThe agrarian region of Marathwada - in which Parbhani falls - has accounted for 4,124 of the suicides.\n\nAccording to 2016 data, the average monthly income of a rural household in Maharashtra is $125. To sustain their families, many farmers have sought extra employment as agricultural labourers, earning about $3.5 a day.\n\nSeveral of the farmers in whose name loans have been drawn live in makeshift one-room thatched-roof huts.\n\nIn contrast, Gutte had assets amounting to $12.6m while his wife's wealth was worth $8m, according to his election affidavit.\n\nFarmers file case\n\nThe scandal would have probably never been uncovered had Maruti Rathod's father not fallen sick in August 2016.\n\nRathod, a small farmer in Gangakhed, needed money for his father's treatment but the local branch of his bank refused him a loan, citing another crop loan he had secured from another bank.\n\n\"Until that moment, I had not even visited the city where this branch was located,\" Rathod says. \"It is more than 400km away. Why would I borrow money from a bank that is so far?\"\n\nRathod took the train to Nagpur - where the other branch was - to get details of the loan issued in his name.\n\n\"The bank officials initially refused to give me any details,\" he says. But when they realised he did not intend to leave without information, the bank gave him a letter stating his loan account had been repaid that month.\n\nThe incident raised Rathod's suspicions and he kept digging, eventually finding others in the same situation.\n\nSix of the farmers filed a case against Gutte in the high court in June 2017 with the support of a local politician associated with the rival Nationalist Congress Party.Â Investigations that ensued slowly revealed there were more than 24,000 farmers like Rathod who had no idea they had loans in their names.\n\n'Politically motivated'\n\nGutte's lawyer, Milind Kshirsagar, denies the charges of fraud against his client.\n\nRajebhau Phad, Gutte's son-in-law and his campaign manager, calls the case \"politically motivated\".\n\n\"If my father-in-law had done anything wrong, he would not have been able to win an election from jail,\" he says. \"He was a sugarcane farmer himself. Nobody would procure the sugarcane he harvested. That is when he made a promise to start his own factory so no farmer in Gangakhed would face what he had to.\"\n\nProfessor Shankar from Gangakhed wonders how a loan was taken in his name [Parth MN/Al Jazeera]\n\nHowever, Pralhad Bachate, the lawyer representing the farmers in court, says it is an open and shut case.\n\n\"All the papers prove Gutte has committed a fraud,\" he says. \"Yet, it takes two years for the agencies to arrest him. He has been close to the establishment.\"\n\nPeople in the constituency of Gangakhed think twice before speaking about Gutte, Al Jazeera has been told. Several farmers refused to share details of how they were duped. Those who did only opened up after moving out of a tea stall into a private space.\n\nGutte's clout extends not only to his constituents but also to bank officials, without whom he could not have run the loan swindle, said Devidas Tuljapurkar, joint secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association.\n\nAt least seven lower-ranked bank officials told the court they sanctioned the loans because there were orders from higher up the ladder and that they had not seen the farmers when they opened the accounts.\n\nIn July 2017, the auditors of Syndicate Bank's Parbhani branch wrote a letter, which Al Jazeera has seen, to its general manager pointing out the officers who were involved in the suspected fraud.\n\nThe staff was \"tampering with loan files\", the letter observed. It further claimed that the sugar factory's staff accessed the bank's computers and LAN. The letter concluded by listing GSELâs sister companies through which the bank officials might have been bribed.\n\nTuljapurkar, the joint secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association, says most sugarcane factories are owned by people close to politicians, which is why the bank officials \"are under pressure to release their loans\".\n\n\"It is a clear nexus that has farmers at a disadvantage,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nUntil the case is resolved in court, the farmers are at a disadvantage, their records showing unpaid loans, making it difficult to access new loans for emergencies or to keep their farms running.\n\nMoreover, they have been pressured by the banks to pay loans.\n\nRamesh Pawar, 47, another farmer from Gangakhed, in whose name fraudulent loans amounting to Rs 5.5 lakhs ($7,704) have been issued from two banks, wanted a home loan to build a concrete house. \"But the bank refused to release money,\" he says.Â\n\nWhen ordinary farmers want to access a loan, adds Pawar, banks scrutinise their past and current assets and credit histories. Not so the influential figures who were able to secure loans with no trouble.\n\n\"The bigwigs even get loans on behalf of farmers that are long gone,\" he says. \"At least the ones that are dead don't have to endure the stress. I never thought I would envy a dead farmer.\""

            "content": "NEW DELHI Shifting cultivation , an age-old practice in parts of India, may soon get legal backing, with the government planning to define land use that will enable such cultivators access credit and agriculture-related benefits including subsidies.India has nearly 1.73 million hectares under shifting cultivation, where plots of land are cultivated temporarily and then abandoned for years so that the land becomes fertile again. An estimated 6.23 lakh families are involved in this activity, 90% of which is in the Northeast based on 2003 data.Credit is often denied to these cultivators because, in the absence of land titles, they are unable to offer the land as collateral for loans. The government move, spearheaded by the NITI Aayog , is aimed at backing this type of cultivation to help restore the fertility of land naturally, while at the same time ensuring that cultivators of Jhum, a term used for shifting cultivation in the Northeast, have enough employment opportunities.A comprehensive policy related to shifting cultivation is being firmed up to recognise the land used for shifting cultivation as agricultural land where farmers practice agroforestry for the production of food, a senior official told ET.“Defining land use will ensure that cultivators have income-generation and entrepreneurial opportunities through access of credit,” the official said.The Aayog is holding consultations with the ministries of environment and agriculture to get the latest data on shifting cultivation as part of the overarching policy.“The comprehensive policy could include developing models for agroforestry in the area, assessing the areas under cultivation in 2020 and the number of families involved to better target policies,” the official said.Once land use is defined, the government will incentivise state agencies to formalise, promote and organise marketing of the produce of such farmers, to help provide income-generation and youth-employment opportunities in the region.At present, the land used for shifting cultivation falls under the purview of agriculture during the cultivation phase and under forests during the fallow phase. Hence, they are often classified as ‘abandoned land’, ‘wasteland’ and ‘unclassed state forests’.The proposed policy may prescribe amendments to credit guidelines to allow group guarantee, from village or clan authorities, instead of land title deeds for cultivators to avail of loans, the official added.The Aayog has roped in the North-East Space Application Centre at Shillong to find the current area under shifting cultivation and the number of families involved in it using satellite imaging over next six months."

In his words the new MFF must consolidate what has been achieved so far and at the same time give answers to the new challenges.\n\nBulgaria will also insist on bridging the gaps between regions.

            "content": "Global model\n\nTo assess the global potential of SPHS, our methodology integrates five critical components, which are: topography, river network and hydrology data, infrastructure cost estimation and project design optimization. SPHS project suitability mainly depends on the topography, distance to a river and water availability, which together determine the technical potential. Additional contextual factors, such as distance from energy demand and associated transmission infrastructure losses and associated costs, determine the economic feasibility. Whilst previous studies have used similarly high-resolution topography for conventional reservoir dams estimation16, the possibility of storing water and energy by pumping water to a reservoir parallel to a major river has not been globally assessed. Since storage potential and infrastructure costs are highly dependent on the topography, our new spatially explicit approach identifies numerous technically feasible candidate sites and provides estimates of costs.\n\nDetails of the SPHS world potential model framework are explained step-by-step in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 3–5. The model goes through each grid cell location delineated at a 15″ resolution, implementing a detailed siting assessment that accounts for topography and hydrology in the calculation of project-level costs. The model performs the stages as follows. First, it looks for a river with reasonable flowrate up to 30 km away from a reservoir (Fig. 3c), second it checks if a dam up to 250 m high can be built from the grid cell (Fig. 3d), third it removes projects with competing dams (Fig. 3e), fourth it finds the flooded side of the dam and creates the reservoir (Fig. 3f), fifth it calculates the volume and flooded areas, sixth it compares the size of the storage site with the water available for storage (Fig. 3g), seventh it estimates the costs of the dam, tunnel, turbine, generator, excavation and land, eighth it estimates water and energy storage costs (Fig. 3i).\n\nFig. 3: Seasonal pumped hydropower storage (SPHS) world potential model framework. a Topographical data input from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)30. b River network Strahler data input from the Global River Network (GRIN)31. c Finding rivers close to the SPHS site. d Looking for possible dams. e Limiting the number of proposed SPHS projects. f Creating and finding reservoirs. g Hydrological data input32. h Representation of a possible SPHS project in the Zambezi river basin. i Cheapest SPHS projects in 1-degree resolution. j Location with several SPHS projects proposed. Full size image\n\nSPHS reservoirs in this study are operated to reduce the seasonality and interannual river flow variations, to regulate the flow of the river. If the river flow is already constant, then the water available for storage in the SPHS reservoir will be zero, as it would deregulate the flow of the river. The hydrological data were used to restrict the size of the storage reservoirs, according to water availability. This guarantees that there will be water available to fill up the storage reservoir without having a considerable impact on the overall river flow. Additionally, conservative storage values are assumed to reduce the impact of the SPHS plant in the river flow. The maximum volume of the reservoir equals to 11% of the annual river flow, from which the need for storage is divided by seasonal storage needs and inter-annual storage needs. This value was selected with the intent of reducing the environmental impact of storage on the overall river flow. On average, the water available for storage in SPHS reservoirs in this model equals to 7.7% of the annual river flow (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nData collection\n\nThe SPHS World Potential Model provides a near-global scale potential (56°S–60°N). The excluded area is due to unavailable Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) topographic data. The topographic data applied is SRTM30 and has 3″ resolution. The resolution is decreased to 15″, assuming the centre point, to reduce modelling time and to combine with the river network data. The river network data assumed the Strahler methodology in Global-scale river network (GRIN)31, which is derived from the SRTM data and has 15″ resolution. The topographic and river Strahler data are then combined with the hydrological data taken from the PCR-GLOBWB32 global hydrological model, which are derived into annual discharge, seasonal, and inter-annual variations. We use methods to optimize the number and diameter of the tunnels33 and for cost-estimation34 procedures, which are further explained in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.\n\nSite selection model and engineering design\n\nThe site selection model is divided into nine main stages (Supplementary Table 4). Initially, the topographic data are combined with the river Strahler data, which is a numerical measure of its branching complexity and was derived from the same topographic data. The higher the Strahler stream order value the more tributary rivers (branches) deliver water to the given part of the river31. The two are compared at the same resolution to identify rivers within the topographic data and to estimate the length of the tunnels connecting the upper reservoir and the lower reservoir in the river. The river Strahler data are also used to reduce the amount of SPHS projects developed within a given area and reduce the modelling time. Rivers with small river Strahler stream order have low river flows, which results in unviable SPHS projects with small generation capacities. A minimum river Strahler stream order of 7 is selected because the river has a considerable number of tributary rivers connected to it, which results in a relatively large and constant river flow.\n\nFor each land grid cell at a latitude between 60° N and 56° S (point under analysis (PUA)), the model searches for rivers with sufficient discharge (river Strahler stream order ≥7) within 1–30 km of distance, which consists of the tunnel length. If a large river is found, the model attempts to build dams of 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 m height, along four axes (N–S, W–E, NW–SE, NE–SW) and with a maximum length of 7.2 km (Supplementary Table 4 (L4)). If the topography allows the construction of such dams, it verifies whether the PUA is the lowest point of the dam (if it is not, the process stops with the intention of not repeating the same project). Using the surrounding topography and observing limits to the maximum flooded area of the reservoir, the model identifies the side with the largest storage volume. Subsequently, the reservoir water level is varied to determine the flooded area vs. level and storage volume vs. level curves. This is done by subtracting the volume of land and water with the reservoir at a given level by the volume of land and water with the reservoir at its minimum level. Project costs are estimated using the equations presented in the ref. 34. The cost is divided in dam, tunnel, powerhouse excavation, pump-turbine, electro-technical equipment and land costs. More details on the assumptions for the cost estimate are presented in Supplementary Table 3. In the analysis, the water storage capacity of the SPHS projects is limited according to the water availability of the main river. The maximum water storage capacity is limited to 11% of the annual river flow, which is a small portion of the river flow and results in a small impact to the river. If the storage capacity is much higher than the amount of water available, the estimated cost of storage increases, as a section of the reservoir will never fill up. The project costs are then compared with the hydrology of the river to find the water and energy storage costs with Eqs. (4) and (5).\n\nStorage dimensioning and cost\n\nThe seasonal and interannual variability of river discharge used in the Hydrological Analysis Stage is calculated with the Eqs. (1) and (2). They are important to calculate the water available for storage in the SPHS reservoir, with the objective of producing a constant river flow. If the river has no seasonal variation, then the water available for storage would be equal to zero. This is because, if the SPHS deregulates the flow of the river, the hydropower potential of the dams in cascade or the water supply downstream could be negatively affected.\n\n$$S_{\\mathrm{{V}}} = \\frac{{\\sqrt {\\frac{{\\mathop {\\sum }\n\nolimits_{m \\in M} (\\bar q_{\\mathrm{{m}}} - \\bar q_{\\mathrm{{s}}})^2}}{{N_{\\mathrm{{m}}}}}} }}{{\\bar q_{\\mathrm{{s}}}}}\\quad\\left\\{ {{\\mathrm{{if}}}\\;S_{\\mathrm{{V}}} \\,> \\, 1 \\to S_{\\mathrm{{V}}} = 1} \\right.$$ (1)\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{{V}}} = \\frac{{\\sqrt {\\frac{{\\mathop {\\sum }\n\nolimits_{y \\in Y} (\\bar q_y - \\bar q_{\\mathrm{{s}}})^2}}{{N_{\\mathrm{{y}}}}}} }}{{\\bar q_{\\mathrm{{s}}}}}\\quad\\left\\{ {{\\mathrm{{if}}}\\;I_{\\mathrm{{V}}} \\,> \\, 1 \\to I_{\\mathrm{{V}}} = 1} \\right.$$ (2)\n\nwhere, S V is the seasonal variation index, I V is the interannual variation index, \\(\\bar q_{\\mathrm{{m}}}\\) is the river flow of a given m month, \\(\\bar q_{\\mathrm{{y}}}\\) is the average river flow of a given year, \\(\\bar q_{\\mathrm{{s}}}\\) is the average river flow over y years, N m is the number of months, N y is the number of years.\n\nThe costs of water and energy storage services calculated in the Estimate Storage Cost stage vary according to the annual river flow, the seasonal and interannual variation indexes. These hydrological parameters have three main purposes. Firstly, they intend to guarantee that there will be sufficient water in the river to be stored in the upper reservoir. Secondly, the need for water and energy storage should not have a substantial detrimental impact on the river flow. Thirdly, the water storage potential intends to regulate the flow of the river and produce a constant flow of water, reducing its seasonality and interannual variations.\n\nUsing the values calculated for S V and I V (Supplementary Fig. 2) and the percentage of river annual discharge available for storage (Supplementary Fig. 1), the water available for storage Q A (Eq. (3)) is calculated by\n\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{{A}}} = Q \\times (S_{\\mathrm{{V}}} \\times 0.1) \\times (1 + (I_{\\mathrm{{V}}} \\times 0.1))$$ (3)\n\nwhere Q A is the water available for storage in km3 yr−1, Q is the river annual discharge in km3 yr−1.\n\nThe variation of the water and long-term energy storage costs with the water available for storage is presented in Eq. (4). The costs for additional short-term energy storage are presented in Eq. (5). For more details on Eqs. (1)–(5) please refer to the Supplementary Table 2.\n\n$$C_{\\mathrm{{W}}} = \\frac{{C_{\\mathrm{{P}}}}}{{W_{\\mathrm{{S}}}}};\\,C_{\\mathrm{{{Ewc}}}} = \\frac{{C_{\\mathrm{{P}}}}}{{E_{\\mathrm{{{Rwc}}}}\\frac{{W_{\\mathrm{{R}}}}}{{W_{\\mathrm{{S}}}}}}};\\,C_{\\mathrm{{{Ewoc}}}} = \\frac{{C_{\\mathrm{{P}}}}}{{E_{\\mathrm{{{Rwoc}}}}\\frac{{W_{\\mathrm{{R}}}}}{{W_{\\mathrm{{S}}}}}}}\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\mathrm{{if}}}\\;W_{\\mathrm{{R}}} \\,<\\, Q_{\\mathrm{{A}}} \\to W_{\\mathrm{{S}}} = W_{\\mathrm{{R}}}}\\hfill \\\\ {{\\mathrm{{if}}}\\;Q_{\\mathrm{{A}}} \\,<\\, W_{\\mathrm{{R}}} \\,<\\, 2Q_{\\mathrm{{A}}} \\to W_{\\mathrm{{S}}} = Q_{\\mathrm{{A}}} + 0.5W_{\\mathrm{{R}}}} \\\\ {{\\mathrm{{if}}}\\;W_{\\mathrm{{R}}} \\,> \\, 2Q_{\\mathrm{{A}}} \\to W_{\\mathrm{{S}}} = 1.5Q_{\\mathrm{{A}}}}\\hfill \\end{array}} \\right.$$ (4)\n\nwhere C W is the cost of water storage in US$ km−3, C P is the cost of the project (i.e. dam, tunnel, turbine, electrical equipment, excavation, and land) in US$, W s is the water storage capacity adjusted by the water availability in km3, C Ewoc is the cost of long-term energy storage excluding the cascade in US$ MWh−1, C Ewc is the cost of long-term energy storage including the cascade in US$ MWh−1, W R is the water storage capacity of the reservoir developed in the model in km3, E Rwc and E Rwoc are the energy storage capacity of the reservoir developed in the model with and without cascade in MWh, respectively.\n\n$$C_{\\mathrm{{{GW}}}} = \\frac{{C_{\\mathrm{{{PGW}}}}}}{G}$$ (5)\n\nwhere, C GW is the cost of additional generation capacity in US$ kW−1, C PGW is the cost of additional generation capacity (i.e. tunnel, turbine, electrical equipment, excavation) in billion US$, G is the generation capacity in GW (fixed to be 1 GW for all SPHS plants proposed).\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article."

            "content": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nOcean-going ships could be powered by ammonia within the decade as the shipping industry takes action to curb carbon emissions.\n\nThe chemical - the key ingredient of fertilisers - can be burned in ships’ engines in place of polluting diesel.\n\nThe industry hopes ammonia will help it tackle climate change, because it burns without CO2 emissions.\n\nThe creation of the ammonia itself creates substantial CO2, but a report says technology can solve this problem.\n\nThe challenge is huge, because shipping produces around 2% of global carbon emissions – about the same as the whole German economy.\n\nMaking ammonia is also a major source of carbon. A report by the Royal Society says ammonia production currently creates 1.8% of global CO2 emissions – the most of any chemical industry.\n\nBut the authors of the report say new technology can create zero carbon ammonia. One way is by trapping the CO2 emissions created when ammonia is produced, and burying the CO2 in underground rocks.\n\nAnother way of making so-called \"green\" ammonia is to use renewable energy which doesn't create any CO2.\n\nBut the big question is whether enough clean energy will be available to create ammonia at scale in the coming decades.\n\nWhat’s so good about ammonia?\n\nAmmonia is an invaluable jack-of-all-trades chemical – but it is a menace in the wrong place.\n\nIt is shipped in bulk as an essential base for chemicals, textiles, explosives, refrigerants and fertilisers.\n\nBut when it is spread carelessly on fields it causes air and water pollution, and it can react with other chemicals to make greenhouse gases.\n\nThe Royal Society report says farmers need to use ammonia much more carefully.\n\nBut it notes that the near ubiquitous use of ammonia for agriculture has conveniently generated a global network of ports where the chemical is traded or stored.\n\nThat means the infrastructure for storing chilled ammonia as a shipping fuel already exists. In the USA, for instance, one existing ammonia pipeline runs for 2,000 miles.\n\nImage copyright Man Energy Solutions Image caption Ammonia engines can be developed from liquefied petroleum gas engines like this one\n\nHow soon could ammonia be powering ships?\n\nThe engine designer Man Energy Solutions is making a two-stroke ammonia-powered engine it hopes will be ready by 2024.\n\nThe firm’s spokesman, Peter Kirkeby, told the BBC: “We see a very big interest from the market in ammonia as a fuel – even though there are challenges.\n\n“We expect the first ships fuelled with ammonia will be existing tankers that are already transporting ammonia for fertiliser. They know how to handle it.”\n\nHe said he expected ammonia to match the price of other alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas or methanol.\n\nHowever, the report shows how inefficient these fuels are compared with energy-dense diesel.\n\nThis means that ships powered by greener fuels need to set aside more valuable space for fuel storage.\n\nThat’s why the report’s authors say hydrogen will be too bulky to fuel ocean-going ships.\n\nAnd there's a further problem. Burning ammonia may not cause CO2 emissions, but it does create nitrogen oxides, which are also greenhouse gases. The report says technology will need to be developed to deal with this.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nIs there a bit of wishful thinking on ammonia?\n\nThe Royal Society’s lead author, Prof Bill David, told the BBC: “Ammonia is the only zero-carbon fuel that will get you across the oceans.\"\n\nBut he warned: “In terms of emissions from industrial processes, ammonia comes only after cement and steel, so we need to decarbonise the production of ammonia.”\n\nA recent academic report called Absolute Zero was sceptical as to whether the ammonia industry could expand fast enough to power ships, while decarbonising at the same time.\n\nIt said the implementation at scale of ammonia from renewables would be an additional burden to the decarbonised power grid.\n\nProf David disagrees. He says: \"Ammonia is the only way to store zero-carbon fuel from renewables for days, months and years.\"\n\nThe UN shipping body, the IMO, has a target of halving emissions from international shipping by 2050 compared with 2008.\n\nA group of major shipping owners says $2 (£1.50) should be levied on every tonne of ships' fuel to support research into clean engines.\n\nEnvironmentalists have consistently complained the industry is not playing its part in reducing emissions. In the short term they want to reduce the amount of shipping overall, and impose slower cruising speeds to save fuel.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

            "content": "Harnessing Big Data: Can Our Laws and Policies Keep Up?\n\nPublic policies and commercial norms could constrain our ability to realize the full potential of big data.\n\nImage: Production Perig - stockadobe.com\n\nWe are just at the beginning of the big data revolution. What was merely a prediction a few years ago is happening today. Not only are we creating data at exponential rates, we are starting to figure out how to harness it -- albeit at a nascent stage. The growth of the cloud and the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is allowing us to actually see the value and benefits of what big data can offer. Now that we are able to harness big data, we are also beginning to understand both public policy and commercial norms that are constraining society from realizing the full potential of this resource.\n\nWhy is big data such a big deal?\n\nEvery heartbeat, every slight change in the weather and every rotation around the sun generates unimaginable amounts of data. Until recently, however, we were not able to capture much of it. In fact, 90% of the data that exists today was created in the past two years. This trend will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nGrasping the amount of data being created and captured today is next to impossible. Virtually every new industrial system being built today has hundreds, if not thousands of sensors. We are also retrofitting older systems with sensor technology. Globally, discrete manufacturing, transportation, and logistics industries are expected to spend $40 billion each on IoT technologies in 2020 alone. This is up from $10 billion in 2015.\n\nRolls-Royce, the premier engine manufacturer is diving headfirst into this IoT revolution by putting sensors on its jet engines. A Boeing 787 with a Rolls-Royce engine generates an average of 500GB of data per flight with long-haul trips producing several terabytes. Sensors aren’t just for manufacturing and industrial machines; they are also being deployed in agriculture. Today, farmers are using robots, drones and wireless sensors to collect data about farm functions and weather. It is estimated that by 2050, an average farm will generate 4.1 million data points every day.\n\nData overload -- what to do with it all?\n\nAll the data being collected isn’t simply going to waste. The convergence of high-capacity computing power, advancement of AI, improvements in wireless technology and the scale offered by cloud computing allow us to process these massive data troves. This means that those terabytes of data being collected on the 787 engine making a transatlantic flight are able to be sent to a cloud computing data center, occasionally in real time, and analyzed in milliseconds.\n\nThe results generated are being used for virtually every purpose. By combining all this data and using artificial intelligence, Boeing can more accurately predict when mechanical parts are going to fail, improving safety and maintenance, as well as enhancing the efficiency of the engine during flight. It can also potentially be used by aviation regulators to monitor safety issues.\n\nIn the agriculture space, using artificial intelligence to combine data sets, along with macro-weather data sets, farmers will be able to manage their water usage more efficiently, limit the over consumption of fertilizer, and better predict crop yields. These data sets could also help governments plan their agriculture policy and improve how investors predict market fluctuations.\n\nAre we ready for the data blitz?\n\nAs advancements in technology are making all this possible, is society ready for this phenomenon? Existing laws and policies, as well as antiquated contractual relationships, can add friction to the ability to make the most of data collected. Whether it be intellectual property rights, privacy rights or the simple fact that data exists in thousands of different formats, the roadblocks preventing effective use of data are everywhere.\n\nMy farming example highlights the potential problem. Farmers are producing data that would be very helpful for both governments and researchers, and in many if not most cases these data sets are more valuable to the farmers when shared with others than kept to themselves. At the same time, what mechanisms can farmers use to protect any potentially commercially sensitive information, while still sharing the data? And say that this data is made available, what are the principles and practices by which the government uses this data to deliver better public services? The same questions arise from government generated macro-weather data. How can this data be shared in such a way that private companies and researchers can access it? Furthermore, if an entity shares its data, how can we encourage a common format for distribution?\n\nAny changes in policy or business relationships must take a long-term approach that maintains incentives to collect data, while continuing to improve how data are processed. This is in addition to the larger societal issues of protecting privacy and ensuring nefarious actors are not given a platform to abuse these systems.\n\nTim Molino is a technology consultant at Peck Madigan Jones in Washington, D.C.

They will come up with a final draft by the end of the year following feedback from interested parties.\n\nThe core of the EU's data strategy is the creation of a single European data market and smaller data markets centered on key industries, according to a draft seen by Reuters last month.\n\nOther elements include new rules covering cross-border data use, data interoperability and standards related to manufacturing, climate change, the auto industry, healthcare, financial services, agriculture and energy.\n\nOne of the possibly controversial proposals calls for doing away with EU competition rules against anti-competitive data sharing.\n\nIn response to complaints about the power wielded by large online platforms, the Commission is also considering introducing rules to stop these companies from unilaterally imposing conditions for access and use of data or benefiting from this in a disproportionate manner.\n\nThe discussion paper on artificial intelligence aims to set up a framework to govern the use of this technology used by an increasing number of companies, a draft seen by Reuters showed. The rules would apply to high-risk sectors such as healthcare, transport and predictive policing.\n\nMore onerous rules known as the digital services act, which could force the tech giants to take on more responsibilities for their actions and content hosted on their platforms, are expected to be announced towards the end of the year.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\n\nWelcome to Tech2 Innovate, India’s most definitive youth festival celebrating innovation is being held at GMR Grounds, Aerocity Phase 2, on 14th and 15th February 2020.

            "content": "The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has developed digital tools that will be useful to Nigerian cassava farmers in the 2020 planting season and years after.\n\nThe organisation made this known in a press release signed by its Digital Extension and Advisory Services Specialist, Godwin Atser, on February 6.\n\nThis development will go a long way in helping cassava farmers address the numerous challenges they face in each planting season.\n\nNigeria ranked as the largest producer of cassava in the world, according to the Global Cassava Processing Report in 2019, showing that cassava plays a major role in the country's economy.\n\nCassava is food and a major source of income to many in Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is also used as a raw material for products such as ethanol, chalk, food, pharmaceutical, glues and among others.\n\n\"Africa is a major producer of cassava in the world, but many farmers are recording low yield per hectare (less than 10 tons per ha) due to poor weed management, wrong application of fertilizers, low knowledge of cassava agronomy, and the cultivation of poor quality seeds with low genetic potential,\" Bernard Vanlauwe, Director for Central Africa Hub at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), said.\n\n\"On the flip side, countries in Asia have yield of more than 20 tons per hectare. This is not cheery news.\"\n\nHere are the eight digital tools and their functions:\n\n1. Akilimo\n\nAkilimo is an all-in-one agronomic advisory tool that helps cassava growers with knowledge and recommendations to intensify their cassava-based cropping systems.\n\nAkilimo has the combined 3-2-1 service of Viamo, which makes it easier for any farmer to have information through their mobile phones.\n\nDialing 3-2-1 on any mobile phone with an Airtel sim card connect a farmer to this cassava agronomy information free of charge up to 10 times in a month. \"All that a farmer needs to use this service is a simple mobile phone with an Airtel sim card and the ability to press 3-2-1 on the phone, the service requires no education and no internet and the advisory service on Viamo is available in English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo.\" according to IITA.\n\nClick here: https://cassavamatters.org/akilimo/ to download the paper version of Akilimo\n\n2. IITA Herbicide Calculator\n\nThe herbicide calculator is a mobile app designed to forestall incidents of under-dosing or overdosing of herbicides. The institute says the apps have been embraced by many cassava farmers in Nigeria, Tanzania and several other African countries.\n\n\"The app also prevents environmental pollution and herbicides resistance arising from herbicides abuse,\" says Friday Ekeleme, a professor and principal investigator on Weeds under ACAI.\n\nThe app helps farmers and sprays service providers to estimate correctly, the quantity of herbicides to be added to knapsack sprayers and promotes the effectiveness of herbicides.\n\nClick here: https://cassavamatters.org/iita_herbicide-calculator/ to download IITA Herbicide Calculator\n\n3. Cassava Seed Tracker\n\nThis is a web-app that provides essential features for quality seed production, access to quality stem cuttings of improved cassava varieties from the accredited seed producers and registration of seed fields for accreditation by National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC).\n\nThe Seed Tracker has an android app version that can be downloaded from Google Playstore. The app provides details of improved cassava varieties released in Nigeria, the location and availability for ready access according to the organization. Also, the map-based curation features readily helps users to navigate for information and access seed sellers or buyers.\n\nClick here: https://seedtracker.org/cassava/ to access Cassava Seed Tracker\n\n4. Cassava Matters (Cassavamatters.org)\n\nThis is an online knowledge bank for farmers, extension agents, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders in the cassava sector.\n\nIt also serves as a collaborative platform between the Cassava Weed Management Project also known as the Sustainable Weed Management Technologies for Cassava Systems in Nigeria, the African Cassava Agronomy Initiative (ACAI) and the Cassava Seed Systems project also known as Building an Economically Sustainable, Integrated Seed System for Cassava in Nigeria (BASICS).\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Nigeria Food and Agriculture By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

            "content": "Odisha Finance Minister Niranjan Pujari on Tuesday presented the annual budget for 2020-21 with an outlay of Rs 1,50,000 crore, a rise of 11.1 in comparison to the previous fiscal. While Rs 65,655 crore has been allocated as administrative expenditure, Rs 74,000 crore is meant for programme expenditure, Rs 3,200 crore for disaster response fund and Rs 7,145 crore towards transfers from the state, Pujari said in the assembly, describing it as a revenue surplus budget.\n\nThe minister had presented a Rs 1.39 lakh-crore budget for 2019-20. Pujari said the outlay is proposed to be financed through revenue receipt of Rs 1,24,300 crore and borrowing and other receipt of Rs 25,700 crore. \"The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 3 per cent of GSDP for the year 2020-21,\" he said. The total revenue receipt include the state's own tax of Rs 38,350 crore and non-tax revenue of Rs 17,650 crore, its share in central taxes for Rs 36,300 crore and grants from the Centre for Rs 32,000 crore.\n\nThe capital outlay in 2020-21 is Rs 26,513 crore, which is about 4.5 per cent of the GSDP. Additionally, loans and advances, grants for creation of capital assets and other expenditure for capital formation together account for Rs 10,000 crore, accounting for 1.7 per cent of the GSDP. For the first time, the Odisha government has switched to a digital method of budget presentation to reduce printing of papers for the exercise, Pujari said, adding, the e-budget format has saved about \"1,000 large trees from being felled\".\n\nPujari read out his budget speech from a tablet computer, while all MLAs, including Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, were provided with similar devices containing the budget document. The finance minister said nutrition budget, strategic budget and a climate code budget have been introduced this year. By separating specific sectors, focus has been given to environment, child and women and infrastructure development, he said. Pujari, like other years, presented the budget in two parts - agriculture and general.\n\nFor agriculture, he collocated Rs 19,408 crore for 2020-21 and said another Rs 12,000 crore is to be invested through extra budgetary resources. To increase income of farmers, the finance minister proposed a 'Samruddha Krishi Niti-2020' in the budget. He proposed an allocation of Rs 3,195 crore for the KALIA scheme.Pujari added that construction of in-stream storage structure in all major rivers with an investment of Rs 12,000 crore over five years is a step towards transformation.\n\nAlso read: 7th Pay commission: Odisha approves 10% arrears; increases 5% DA for govt employees\n\nAlso read: At 9.1%, India to see decade's lowest salary hike in 2020: report"

            "content": "ISLAMABAD: China is sending a team of technical experts to Pakistan to deliberate on the aerial management of locust swarms in the country.\n\nThe locust swarm invaded the country last year and has devastated the cotton crop in the last planting season and is already threatening the country’s wheat crop.\n\nThe swarm arrived last summer, but has grown to threatening proportions since November 2019 when the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) issued a warning that the swarm has started to leave its reproducing grounds in the deserts from Cholistan to Tharparkar.\n\nThe federal government has declared an emergency this month but is struggling to figure out a robust response.\n\nIn this regard, Minister for National Food Security and Research Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtyar on Tuesday met with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing and underscored the urgent need of aerial support along with pesticides to contain the breeding of locusts in vulnerable areas.\n\nThe envoy assured of full support and to consider supply of pesticides and spraying equipment to Pakistan as an emergency project.\n\nA senior official of the food security ministry told Dawn that the Chinese technical experts’ delegation will arrive in Islamabad on Sunday to start evaluation of the locust situation. Besides discussions with the ministry officials and Pakistani experts, the Chinese team will also visit locust affected areas in the provinces.\n\nDuring the meeting, Bakhtyar underlined the importance of measures taken by neighbouring countries to control locust swarms.\n\nThe Chinese envoy said that China is interested in increasing its import of agricultural products from Pakistan, including onion, potato and meat. In this regard, China wants to ease the export of such products from Pakistan before the high-level visit which is expected in May, he added.\n\nMinister Bakhtyar welcomed the Chinese interest in the import of agricultural products from Pakistan. He also acknowledged the pro-activeness of China to support Pakistan on the locust issue and said this shows the strength of Pak-China relationship.\n\nThe meeting was atten­ded by National Disaster Management Authority Cha­­­ir­man Lt-General Muh­a­m­mad Afzal, Secretary National Food Security Dr Muhammad Hashim Pop­alzai, Food Security Comm­issioner Dr Syed Waseem-ul Hasssan and Animal Husbandry Commissioner Dr Khurshid Ahmed.\n\nMeanwhile, FAO Director General Qu Dongyu has pledged to help Pakistan fight its desert locust emergency after witnessing the devastating impact of the upsurge in Punjab region. During his recently concluded visit, Dongyu saw how the desert locust upsurge was destroying crops and harming rural communities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 19th, 2020"

            "content": "The world’s first publicly available human-elephant conflict (HEC) resolution mechanism is being developed with the partnership of the academia with the public and private sectors in the country.\n\nThe science-backed mechanism in the form of standard operating procedures (SOP) is made possible by a collaboration between the Management and Ecology of Malaysian Elephants (MEME) and Sime Darby Plantation Bhd (SDP) through Yayasan Sime Darby to champion the co-existence between humans and the endangered animals.\n\nPrimary Industries Minister Teresa Kok lauded the initiative and said it addresses the rising HEC incidences among villagers, plantation workers and elephants.\n\n“We need to strike a balance between production in agriculture and protection of wildlife,” she said in her speech during the launching of Yayasan Sime Darby and MEME project phase three at the University of Nottingham Malaysia yesterday.\n\nAlso present were Wildlife and National Parks Department (Perhilitan) director-general Abdul Kadir Abu Hashim, SDP group managing director Mohamad Helmy Othman Basha and MEME principal investigator Dr Wong Ee Phin.\n\nIn the next three years under phase three, MEME will be working with various communities on the ground through capacity building to find effective ways to help them manage HEC and test if the intervention is effective as it is aimed at not just reducing HEC, but also to increase the tolerance of the various communities towards elephants.\n\nKok (photo) said as the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, Malaysia places great importance on sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nWhile noting that Malaysian palm oil is continuously being targeted by international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as foreign countries, in particular, the European Union (EU) for being unsustainable, Kok said Malaysia is committed to ensure sustainable practices in all the value chain of palm oil production.\n\n“We are now moving towards a more dynamic and sustainable era, supported by new governance policies and with many areas being redefined by the current government such as the mandatory implementation of Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO),” she said.\n\nApart from that, she said Malaysia is now focusing on improving productivity and yields, rather than expanding land for oil palm cultivation.\n\nThus, the way forward is to focus on sustainable agricultural practices of the palm oil industry, she added.\n\n- Bernama"

            "content": "Shocking revelations of alleged smuggling of government's subsidized grain into the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by organized cartels in the local milling industry have emerged, 263Chat Business can reveal.\n\nThe startling revelations came out of the Justice-Mayor Wadyajena chaired Parliamentary committee portfolio on Lands, Agriculture, Water, Climate and Rural Resettlement this morning where millers raised concerns over the rampant arbitrage activities happening in the country.\n\nUnited Milling representative, Davis Muhambi while giving oral evidence went at lengths to describe how subsidized grain meant to cushion the vulnerable was being siphoned out of the country and some being used by processors for various other foodstuffs.\n\n\"We hear all sorts of stories that the maize is sold to bigger millers who then use that maize for other processes like stock feeds, porridge etc. This subsidized maize is cheap and in USD terms in regional parity that maize if you use any rate it cost about US$ 200 (tonne) so it then becomes maize that can be used to make other lines very profitable,\"\n\n\"So, Mr. Speaker that was the maize that was being loaded to go to the DRC. Trucks that carry copper from the north, which is Zambia and DRC, they go into South Africa, they come back empty then they get to the border were they are stamped to be having cargo, which is maize (disguised to be coming) from South Africa, they come to Harare, they pick up that maize, go to DRC via Chirundu with Zimbabwean maize which is subsidized maize. So this is what has been happening,\" Muhambi said.\n\nThe development comes at a time Zimbabwe is struggling to cope with grain shortages to meet local demand despite government efforts to subsidize imported grain.\n\nMuhambi further alleged that at the core of these shenanigans was the expelled Grain Marketing Board (GMB) general manager, Lawrence Jasi who compiled a list of recipients of subsidized grain.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Zimbabwe Governance Legal Affairs By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Please try again later.\n\nAt the time of his expulsion from GMAZ, Muhambi says he had started questioning the manner GMAZ was being run.\n\nThe abuse of the grain subsidy program has become so rife that GMAZ has even assumed usurping power such as that to authorize who does milling business in Zimbabwe and at one point allocating import permits of grain, Wayne Moss of Machiareer Investments, a member of GMAZ said.\n\n\"The abuse of the grain subsidy program is so serious and it needs to be dealt with. Various industry players, I can tell you there is abuse within GMB, there is abuse on who gets what allocation and processors are using roller meal maize to process other commodities,\" Moss added.\n\nIn a statement recently, GMAZ Spokesperson, Garikai Chaunza denied receiving money from government or RBZ adding that the acquittals for the money used to import wheat into the country were send to the respective supplier.\n\n\"For the record, GMAZ has never received loan, grant or any assistance from government of Zimbabwe or Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The USD27M in question relates to foreign currency that GMAZ bought at the prevalent exchange rate at the time, with the funds remitted to the respective supplier.\n\n\"The necessary acquittals proving that the wheat came into the country were done through our bankers. We publicly publicised the statistics showing the quantum of wheat delivered and the distribution of the wheat in all major newspapers namely The Herald, The Chronicle, The Daily News and The Newsday on 20 March 2019,\" said Chaunza.\n\nHe is however expected to appear before the Committee next week."

            "content": "February 19: Soil Health Card Day\n\nIn order to commemorate the launch of Soil Health Card Scheme, the GoI is marking Soil Health Card Day on February 19, 2020. The Soil Health Card Scheme was launched by PM Modi on February 19, 2015.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Scheme was launched in 2015 to evaluate soil fertility. It was introduced to issue soil health cards every two years. The aim of the scheme is to promote soil test in order to promote nutrient management.\n\nNeed\n\nThe deterioration of physical, chemical and biological health of the soil is considered as one of the main reasons for decline in agricultural productivity in the country. The soils are currently holding negative nutrient balance. This is to increase in the future and will decline the fertilizer response of the crop. Therefore, it is essential to improve the soil health.\n\nSoil Health-Other Measures\n\nSoil Health Management\n\nThe Soil Health Management under taken by GoI under the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture strengthens soil testing laboratories, establishes bio-fertilizers and compost units, demonstrations and trainings on balanced use of fertilizers.\n\nNutrient Based Subsidy\n\nThe Nutrient based Subsidy scheme promoted fortified and customized fertilizers. Under the scheme so far 21 fertilizers have been included. The scheme aims at balanced use of fertilizers in order to maintain soil health.\n\nDevelopment of Model Village\n\nIn the year 2019-20, the Development of Model Village project was taken up. Under the scheme, the soil samples were collected from individual farmers rather than collecting from a cluster.\n\nSuccess of Soil Health Card\n\nIn 2017, the National Productivity Council said that the Soil Health Card Scheme promoted sustainable farming. This led to decrease in use of fertilizer application by 8 to 10%. Also, the overall yield of crops increased by 5%. This major improvement was mainly due to application of fertilizers based on recommendations of soil health cards.\n\n5 years of Soil Health Card\n\nRecently the Soil Health Card Scheme completed 5 years of success. Being launched at Suratgarh, Rajasthan to improve health of the soil, the card provides information about the nutrient status of the soil to the farmers.\n\nSince its launch, 110 crore soil cards have been issued.\n\nGet these updates on Current Affairs Today Android App\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonth:Current Affairs – February, 2020\n\nCategories: Government Schemes in India\n\nTags: Agriculture • Fertilizers • National Productivity Council • Soil Biodiversity • soil health\n\n"

(\"Trendlines\") (SGX: 42T) (OTCQX: TRNLY), is pleased to announce that its newly-formed fund, Trendlines Agrifood Fund Pte. Ltd. (\"the Fund\"), has made its first investment, investing in Equinom Ltd, (\"Equinom\") a seed breeding technology business.\n\nAwareness of the agrifood industry's impact on climate change is a growing global priority. Technological solutions will be a major driver and critical component of change and development in the agrifood industry and this represents a major opportunity for the Fund. Equinom's unique non-GMO technology, which optimizes seed functionality to increase plant yield, higher nutritional value, disease resistance and more, is an ideal fit with the Fund's focus and strategy. The Trendlines Agrifood Fund is investing US$1.6 million (of an US$10 million round) alongside lead investor BASF Venture Capital, the investment arm of global materials and chemical company BASF, as well as existing investors Fortissimo Capital, a leading Israeli private equity fund, and Roquette, a global leader in plant-based ingredients for food, nutrition and health markets and a pioneer in new vegetable proteins.\n\nThe agriculture and food sectors are facing enormous challenges to provide enough nutritious food for a growing population, without destroying the planet's resources. The utilization of technology is key to providing sustainable solutions to these challenges. Equinom leverages traditional crossbreeding with computational genetic algorithms to develop new, highly strategic seed and legume varieties with unmatched accuracy and at significantly higher speeds. Their bioinformatics-based technology accelerates seed breeding, achieving new levels of productivity to enable the creation of high-protein crops for sustainable plant proteins.\n\nTrendlines previously announced that it intends to invest 66% of the Fund's capital in commercial or growth stage companies. CEO of Trendlines Agrifood Fund, Nitza Kardish, PhD., commented,\" The Fund's investment in Equinom corresponds with our investment focus to invest in growth stage companies that have the potential to make a real difference to yields, nutritional value, and sustainability of crops. Equinom's technology and products has the potential to meet all these criteria.\"\n\nAs a key investor in the Fund, British entrepreneur, Vincent Tchenguiz, commented: \"Investing in more sustainable food production systems that mitigate climate change is paramount in tackling the challenges of this century caused by climate change. Our investment in Trendlines and in the Agrifood Fund represents our firm belief in the potential of technologies in the agrifood portfolio to have a profound positive impact on the global food production footprint. This comes at a time when our plant's environment is changing so dramatically and the need for sustainable solutions in the production of food is so great.\"\n\nAbout The Trendlines Group\n\nThe Trendlines Group is an innovation commercialization company that invents, discovers, invests in, and incubates innovation-based medical and agrifood technologies to fulfill its mission to improve the human condition. As intensely hands-on investors, Trendlines is involved in all aspects of its portfolio companies from technology development to business building. Trendlines' shares are traded on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX: 42T) and in the United States, as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) on the OTCQX (OTCQX: TRNLY).\n\nAbout Equinom\n\nEquinom was founded in 2012 on the backdrop of the dramatic transformation in genetics, which made genomic sequencing accessible and affordable. Equinom is now pursuing two parallel breeding tracks.

            "content": "HAGUE, Trelawny — For the first time in the 65-year history of the Hague Agricultural and Industrial Show, the event will have the prime minister of Jamaica doing the official opening duties.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness is expected do the honours on Ash Wednesday, February 26, at 10:00 am.\n\n\n\nMinister of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries Audley Shaw, Jamaica Agricultural Society President Lenworth Fulton, and a host of other stakeholders are also expected to be in attendance.\n\n\n\nPlayers in the agriculture sector are already touting the planned attendance of the prime minister as a major move by the organisers to revive the once-popular show, which had lost its appeal in recent years.\n\n\n\nCustos of Trelawny and patron of the show Paul Muschett said over the past several years he has refused to associate himself with the event because of its dismal quality.\n\n\n\n“What is happening this time around, regarding the organisation and the plans for this year's staging of the Hague Agricultural and Industrial Show, is truly a game-changer.\n\nIt's the first time, to my knowledge, that a prime minister will be opening the show. It's the first time in a long time that I have seen so much interest being shown by the farmers and the wider public,” he revealed.\n\n\n\nCustos Muschett explained that in previous years farmers weren't able to receive their prize monies, the public was unimpressed with the farm produce on display, and myriad other things.\n\n\n\n“These were some of the things which have reduced what was once dubbed as one of the island's premier agricultural and livestock shows to nothing but a poppy-show. But things seem to be vastly better this year, and I am ready to host the prime minister and all the other dignitaries who are slated to attend this year's staging,” he declared.\n\n\n\nFulton, in the meantime, has thrown is full backing behind the show, stressing that “the show is very important to us”.\n\n\n\nHe noted that, after several years of decline the show, which he claimed was the number one agriculture and livestock show in the Caribbean, is improving.\n\n\n\n“From what I saw last year, the show was the best on record. My only question is, 'Can we better last year?'... I have seen the answer — it's a resounding, 'Yes',” Fulton said at the recent launch of the event.\n\n\n\nThe Hague Agricultural and Industrial Show starts on February 25 with a 'Youth Expo in Agriculture', and climaxes on Ash Wednesday, February 26, with a raft of agricultural and industrial displays during the day, followed by a stage show starting at 8:00 pm featuring some of Jamaica's leading entertainers.\n\n\n\nThe two-day event is being held under the theme: 'Agricultural Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Change'."

There are at least three bearish factors currently at play.\n\nThe novel coronavirus epidemic that has reduced Chinese buying of everything like palm oil, milk powder, meat, etc from outside.\n\nThe price of crude oil is another factor.\n\nThe prospect of a bumper rabi (winter-spring) crop in India is the third one. The kharif harvest turned out to be not so good because of excess and unseasonal rain.\n\nAgainst these bearish factors are the relatively “bullish” factors.\n\nGlobal palm oil ending stocks this year are projected to be the lowest since 2009-10 and sugar is also expected to move into deficit.\n\nSupply tightness is being seen both globally and in India, even in milk.\n\nIf Brent crude too, were to rally again, there could be uncertainty ahead. Online Coaching for UPSC PRE Exam General Studies Pre. Cum Mains Study Materials\n\nPrelims Questions:\n\nQ.1) With reference to the exemption from the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) maintenance, consider the following statements:\n\n1. The special lending window with Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) exemption will be open from 14th of February and incremental loans disbursed under this facility will have CRR exemption for the next five years.\n\n2.

Krishnankutty on Tuesday.\n\nOpening the third Indian National Groundwater Conference at the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM) here, he called upon the farmer community to use water judiciously considering the shortage.\n\n“There is a misconception that the crop would be better with more watering. Judicious use of water will give better crop, thus enriching the economy of the State,” said Mr. Krishnankutty, who claimed to be an ordinary farmer. Drinking water should be preserved for the next generations as well, he added.\n\nThe Conference focuses on the topic ‘Groundwater resources management for sustainable development: Special emphasis on coastal and urban environment’. It also encompassd an international workshop on groundwater modelling, which was held on Monday.\n\nAround 300 delegates are taking part in the conference. Around 200 thesis will be presented. Delegates from Russia, Canada, USA, Nigeria, Bangladesh, France, and Nepal are taking part in the four-day conference.\n\nEx Officio Principal Secretary of Science and Technology Department and Executive Vice President of Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) K.P. Sudheer presided over the inaugural session while P.T.A. Rahim, MLA, released the abstract volume of the conference proceedings.\n\nCentral Ground Water Board Regional Director Sanjay Marwaha, National Institute of Technology - Kozhikode Director Sivaji Chakravorti, Association of Global Ground Water Scientists president A.L.Ramanathan, and founder-president of the Association M.

            "content": "It was by chance that India rode the IT wave, but replicating this success with the next big thing—the biosciences revolution—will need the country to be much more proactive.\n\n“If the 20th century was the era of computing, the 21st century may be the era of biosciences,” Ashok Trivedi, co-founder of IGATE (sold to Capgemini in 2016) and managing partner of venture capital fund SWAT Capital Trivedi, said. “India needs to be ready with a talent pool (of bioscientists).”\n\nThe founder & trustee of the private Ashoka University has already committed over Rs100 crore ($13.97 million) to set up the Trivedi School of Biosciences at varsity’s campus in Sonepat, Haryana.\n\nThe new school will be headed by eminent names in the field of biology and technology. The advisory board will be led by Nobel laureate and president of the Royal Society, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan. Nobel laureate Jack Szostak from Harvard University, James Collins of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ronald Vale of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Satyajit Mayor of National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, will help establish the research and teaching agenda.\n\nExpected to be fully functional by December 2021, the new school aims to induct 30 biosciences faculty and 100 doctoral scholars by 2025. However, housed inside an elite university with expensive tuition fees, the question of diversity is likely to remain.\n\nIn an interview with Quartz, Trivedi spoke about the enormous potential of synthetic biology and what India must do to participate in this disruptive field. Edited excerpts:\n\nWhat was the thought behind setting up a biosciences school at Ashoka?\n\nFor the past four years or so, I have been thinking about the possibilities of biosciences. Bio-scientists mostly took a backseat in the last 200 years. Today, physics has reached a level of creative maturity, while bio-scientists are bubbling with youthful excitement. This is especially after the human genome was cracked in the mid-90s.\n\n“Physics has reached a level of creative maturity, while bio-scientists are bubbling with youthful excitement.”\n\nThe first human genome cost $3 billion to sequence. In 2001, the cost fell to $100 million. Today, Illumina, a San Diego based\n\nAshoka University Ashok Trivedi, founder and trustee, Ashoka University\n\ncompany, can do a human genome sequencing for $600. Its CEO predicts they’ll be able to do it for about $200 in the near future. If the 20th century was the era of computing, the 21st century may be the era of biosciences.\n\nI also looked at its implications in various areas, like healthcare, environment, water, and energy. Just look at the possibilities in healthcare alone. While the cost of genetic sequencing has gone down, the speed of the sequencing technology has grown exponentially. This creates the ability to identify tiny mutations in a person’s genes that are tied to many diseases. In the US, they are tackling cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease, which are prevalent in many parts of India. Now, in addition to detecting faulty genes, we are seeing technologies that can edit the genes, as if you’re debugging your software port. This could be the biggest revolution in healthcare since penicillin.\n\nWhat will be the focus of this school?\n\nAdvances in biological sciences, biological engineering, and advanced computing are coming together to form a capability called synthetic biology. At our school of biological sciences at Ashoka, we will be focusing on synthetic biology, which is shaping up to be the next dominant technology. It is a relatively young field, but in a short time, it has made astonishing progress. It has applications in infectious diseases, agriculture, food and water, the environment and producing energy from biomass.\n\nWhat is the potential biosciences market in India from the perspective of job seekers?\n\nI have spent my career in the trenches of the IT industry. I saw it create millions of high-paying jobs. I saw it raise India’s image in the world. The opportunity now is to take this job creation, and India’s image, to new heights through biological sciences. I’m convinced that in the future, there will be biological sciences companies that will exceed the scale of Google, Apple, and Microsoft. And this industry will create enormous high-paying jobs like the IT industry did. And, to me, India needs to be ready with that talent pool because only then we can participate (in this growth).\n\nIndia has to build many biosciences schools to build that pool. So when this field really takes off, India can participate effectively in a biotech revolution. Unlike the IT revolution, where India’s participation was accidental, I believe proactively focusing on this education will give Indians an edge.\n\nHow will this further the interdisciplinary approach at the core of Ashoka?\n\nAshoka has been a liberal arts university, and that is a wonderful platform to start this new school. Recently, about a couple of months back, I was in Silicon Valley. During a dinner in Palo Alto recently with top venture capitalists, they told me they are hiring lots of liberal art graduates. To get a deal done with a tech company, it requires about 15 meetings, they said. Of these, techies are only needed in the first four or five meetings. After that, executives with liberal arts education take over and get that deal done. As Apple founder Steve Jobs put it, technology, married with liberal arts, is what yields results that will make your heart sing.\n\nEverything is becoming interdisciplinary. And if all these people are housed in the same building where they study, they will share ideas and insights.\n\nHow would you ensure greater diversity at the university and within the bioscience school?\n\nUp to 60% of students at Ashoka today get at least some sort of partial scholarship, if not full scholarship. We are absolutely need-blind. We get a lot of students from small towns in India. The rigor and transparency of our admission policy are wonderful. While we are going through the admission process, we don’t even find out about the students’ family income. Only once the applicant clears the admission criteria do we get into offering financial assistance."

It will cripple the growth of our sector,” Neil said.\n\n“Northern Ireland has the lowest unemployment rate for a generation. We have a low birth rate. We do not have the physical bodies here. We’re seeing a drain of EU nationals,” he said.\n\nA policy statement outlining plans for a new points-based system after freedom of movement ends said the economy needs to move away from a reliance on “cheap labour from Europe”.\n\n“Nobody wants to walk into one of our Irish bars and it’s just a row of vending machines or a burger drops to your plate from somewhere. We need people. That’s the bottom line. And if we don’t get them, our industry will not only not grow,” Neil said.\n\nChanges\n\nThe changes are designed to cut the number of low-skilled migrants entering Britain from the beginning of next year but aim to make it easier for higher-skilled workers to get UK visas.\n\nEU and non-EU citizens will be treated equally with criminal background checks carried out on everyone coming to the UK – affecting applications of anyone who has been given a prison sentence of 12 months or more.\n\nPeople who want to live and work in the UK will need to gain 70 points to be eligible to apply for a visa.\n\nThe earning threshold is completely unsuitable for NI.

            "content": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nThe recent restriction placed on motorcycle riders (Okada) and tricycle operators (Keke Marwa) in Lagos State has once again brought to the fore the problem of unemployment in Nigeria.\n\nWhile government has given numerous reasons, including public safety, to justify its actions, opponents of the ban, including the riders themselves, have argued that the ban would only increase unemployment as most of them had resorted to their trade due to difficulties encountered in securing paid employment.\n\nOne particular female rider became the face of this argument when during protests against the ban, she revealed that she possessed a National Diploma but had to take to riding a bike to fend for herself as she could not secure a job.\n\nThis development makes it imperative that government pays urgent attention to the rising spate of unemployment among the youth of Nigeria. Prior to independence, unemployment and poverty were not the problems that they now pose to the country. Jobs were available for the few educated Nigerians. Even those who were not deemed educated by Western standards did not suffer a shortage of jobs.\n\nThis was perhaps due to the low population of the country. In 1955, the population of Lagos numbered at 312,000. By 1980, due to rural urban migration, it has risen to about three million. In the immediate period after independence, unemployment was still not a problem.\n\nMost graduates already had job offers even before leaving school. This was partly due to the fact that the country was structured along the regional basis allowing for growth of the regions on the basis of resources available to it.\n\nAs I have stated earlier, whilst the Western Region was noted for cocoa production, the Eastern and Northern Regions had palm oil and groundnut, respectively. With prudent management, the resources which accrued from agriculture were utilized in several sectors of the economy, leading to a creation of jobs for the population.\n\nHowever, with the coming of the military and the discovery of oil in commercial quantity, things took a turn. Agriculture which hitherto had been the mainstay of the economy was abandoned as Nigerians reveled in the sudden abundance of wealth provided by oil exploration.\n\nSuccessive government paid little attention to economic and infrastructural development. Critical sectors such as power without which there can hardly be industrial development were totally ignored. Consequent upon this, many manufacturing concerns went under and even small businesses were unable to stay afloat.\n\nYet, at this most critical point, Nigeria was still producing graduates from the numerous universities across the country. Furthermore, to add to the problem, the universities were themselves grappling with numerous crises such as strikes, dilapidated infrastructure, brain drain, etc., which were not totally unrelated to the poor state of the economy.\n\nTherefore, Nigeria was suddenly faced with a situation in which the economy could not absorb graduates being produced by the universities; while at the same time the universities were themselves producing unemployable graduates.\n\nIn Nigeria, the unemployment rate is reported by the National Bureau of Statistics. From 2006 to 2011, the unemployment rate averaged 14.6 percent. It recorded a record low percent of 5.6 in December 2006. In 2011, it recorded an all-time high of 23.9 percent.\n\nAt a time, figures released from the National Bureau of Statistics stated that 5.3 million youths were jobless in Nigeria, while 1.8 million graduates enter the labour market every year. The problem has been on for some time due to the inability of authorities to track the numbers of persons entering the labour market every year.\n\nAs at the third quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate in Nigeria, according to africacheck.org, stood at 18.8 percent, while the total percentage of unemployed and underemployed stood at 40 percent. The body stated as follows:\n\n“Nigeria’s latest unemployment data is for July to September 2017. A total of 51.1 million people were estimated to be in full-time employment during this period or working at least 40 hours a week. The country’s unemployment rate stood at 18.8 percent, as Spectator Index had tweeted.\n\nIt was the twelfth consecutive rise since the last quarter of 2014. (Note: Nigeria experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 and entered into a recession in 2016, only exiting it in the second quarter of 2017.) In absolute numbers, the number of people who were unemployed had increased to an estimated 15.9 million, while the underemployed were at about 18 million (21.2%). Combined, 40% of the country’s labour force were, therefore, either underemployed or had no job.”\n\nALSO READ: US gives Nigeria conditions for review of visa ban policy\n\nJigawa, Rivers, Kaduna, Yobe and Akwa Ibom states had the highest levels with 62.4 percent, 61.4 percent, 58.6 percent, 58.1 percent, and 54.8 percent respectively. Ondo which had the lowest rate recorded 34.5 percent\n\nIlls of unemployment\n\nUnemployment anywhere in the world is a major problem that cannot be ignored. It is linked to several societal ills such as crime, drug abuse, societal decadence, etc. The ongoing insurgency in the North East has its root in unemployment and attendant poverty as where there is unemployment there is bound to be poverty.\n\nIf young Nigerians after acquiring educational or vocational training are unable to find jobs, there is bound to be an effect on the rate of poverty in the country. Ours is a society which places emphasis on the nuclear structure of the family with the effect that a salary earner in most cases is responsible for the upkeep not only of his immediate family comprising his spouse and children but comprising also a retinue of relatives.\n\nThus, the unemployment of one individual in our society is bound to affect the abilities of several others to maintain a meaningful or reasonable level of economic existence.\n\nUnemployment and poverty are not a good mix to have in any political structure, particularly where that structure, such as is the case in Nigeria, suffers from other deficiencies as are currently being addressed by the national conference.\n\nWhatever may be the motivation of insurgents who have in recent times stepped up their campaign of calumny in Borno State, it cannot be denied that poverty and unemployment provide fertile ground for breeding destructive ideas. A person who is poor and perhaps without any hope of gainful employment will be an easy target for criminal elements intent on persuading him to join their ranks.\n\nWay out\n\nIt is, therefore, necessary for governments at the federal, state and local government levels to urgently address issues of unemployment and poverty. A situation in which the Federal Government takes the largest chunk of revenue accruing to the country is one that should be urgently addressed and reversed.\n\nThe local governments which are designed to be the closest to the people and therefore positioned to best affect their lives positively should be further repositioned to boost economic activities at the grass-root level, instead of being starved of funds needed to carry out their duty.\n\nThe current situation in which salaries and emoluments of local government chairmen and political appointees account for a large percentage of the expenditure of most local governments should be reviewed.\n\nThis situation is replicated across the state and federal levels where the salaries and emoluments of commissioners, special assistants, senior special assistants and others take up a huge percentage of revenue.\n\nWhen this is added to the cost of running a bicameral legislature at the federal level and the houses of assembly of each state, it is not difficult to see why meaningful policies to address unemployment and poverty are seemingly not of primary importance or concern.\n\nAll these can only achieved by means of the promulgation of a true peoples Constitution that takes care of local realities. Constitutional changes must be made to the structure of the country to permit social and economic development across all tiers of government. The time to act is now.\n\nVanguard News\n\nKindly Share This Story:"

            "content": "Indian sugar millers, saddled with record stockpiles, are eager to cash in on the prospect of resuming exports to Indonesia after being absent from the world’s top import market for years.\n\nThe nation, which vies with Brazil as the top producer, may sell 250,000 tonnes of raw sugar to Indonesia by the end of the local crushing period in May after a change in quality rules by the Southeast Asian country, according to the median of six estimates in a Bloomberg survey of traders and officials.\n\nIndia is returning to Indonesia after a severe drought cut production in Thailand, usually the leading supplier of raw sugar to the country. The new export market may help rein in India’s ballooning reserves, which surged to a record of more than 14 million tonnes on October 1 after bumper harvests.\n\nThis is a golden opportunity for us to export sugar to Indonesia, said Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd., a producers group. Mills just need to shut white sugar production and start making raw’s in the next two months before the crushing season gets over.\n\nIndonesia changed the colour specification for raw sugar imports to allow shipments from India, Kasdi Subagyono, director-general of estate crops at the Agriculture Ministry said Monday. The government halved the ICUMSA measure to 600, Subagyono said, adding Indonesia needs sugar to meet rising household consumption. While targeted at India, the lower level applies to all suppliers.\n\nThe ICUMSA is the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis. Most Indian mills make raw sugar with an ICUMSA of as much as 800. They could not ship to Indonesia, which had a level for imported sugar of 1,200.\n\nGlobal Prices\n\nIncreasing exports from India may curb the rise in global prices that have surged about 10% this year on concern about production in No. 2 exporter Thailand, hit with its worst drought in 40 years. Sugar exports from the country could drop about 40% to 6 million tonnes, according to one industry estimate.\n\nExport contracts have to be signed quickly for mills in Maharashtra and Karnataka to produce raw sugar before crushing ends in about a month, said Abinash Verma, director-general of Indian Sugar Mills Association.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that Indonesia, the world’s biggest importer of the sweetener, will buy 4.4 million tonnes of raw sugar in 2019-20.\n\nIndonesian refiners are waiting for an official notification on the ICUMSA rule before entering import contracts with Indian suppliers, said Bernardi Dharmawan, chairman of the Indonesia Sugar Refiners Association, a group of 11 refiners that only process imported raw sugar for industrial users.\n\nIndonesia may buy 300,000 tonnes from India this year, considering inadequate supplies from Thailand, he said, adding actual purchases depend on prices."

Fishburners doesn't think so\n\nWhile the state of venture capital is a lot better than Scandurra would argue it was five years ago, he said many investors have made their money in traditional industries such as mining and agriculture, and not technology.\n\n\"They don't really understand technology and therefore perceive it to be a very risky investment class, wanting to see customer contracts secured before investment,\" he said.\n\n\"So without realising it, what we have in Australia is a vicious cycle -- a catch 22 -- where startups need seed investment in order to fund their product development and these lengthy sales phases where investors don't put their money in until the contracts are secured.\n\n\"They're failing before they even get off the ground.\"\n\nBureaucracy also needs to get out of the way, with Scandurra saying Stone and Chalk has seen many contracts fall through due to \"perceptions of risk\" from some of the regulators, resulting in corporates and government not proceeding with the procurement of a startup's product or service.\n\n\"In some cases, they've basically struggled to survive,\" he said of the fate of some startups following a failed procurement.\n\nSee also: Moving from startup to established company: Four big shifts (TechRepublic)\n\nThe big four -- Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, ANZ Bank, and Westpac -- hold around 80% market share of the entire Australian finance industry between them.\n\nScandurra would argue that due to the forces of competition and capitalism, the big four are introducing a high degree of automation, which he said equals a loss of jobs.\n\n\"I believe it is a significant handbrake on any economy where four big banks dominate the Australian Stock Exchange and are the most profitable banks per customer in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"What that says to me is that a huge amount of profitability is shifting from industry to a financial service, which arguably doesn't contribute that much to productivity as [much as] potentially other areas of industry could, particularly when it comes to technology creation.\"\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nStone and Chalk demands for new strategy to support Australia's startup fintech sector\n\nIt has criticised the current approach as slow and says solutions are often ad hoc.\n\nDefence instructs startups to look outside government for their first customer\n\nA Defence representative has told startups and early stage companies to have previous successful implementations before pitching its platform to Australian government departments.\n\nStartupAus urges for policy changes to help local tech sector\n\nIt marks the release of the advocacy group's sixth annual Crossroads report.\n\nAustralia isn't buying local cyber and the rest of the world might soon follow\n\nEarly Stage technology investor and partner at Amadeus Capital, Alex van Someren, has warned the encryption-busting legislation hasn't made Australia an attractive place to buy cyber from.\n\nWhy Westpac is making 'frenemies' with fintechs (TechRepublic)\n\nThe bank's CIO has used the term 'frenemies' to describe the relationship Westpac has with the fintech community down under."

Under the bill, the department would need permission from a new nine-member board before it could begin drafting any such regulations. Five members of the board would be selected from agricultural groups.\n\nThe bill comes after the department proposed new minimum setbacks from neighboring properties for farms' manure storage facilities last year. The proposal outraged agricultural groups, who complained the new setbacks were far too draconian and an advisory committee that developed them for the department didn't include any farmers.\n\nThe department dropped the plan amid the uproar. But the proposal so angered Republican senators that they took the unprecedented step in November of voting against confirming the department's secretary, Brad Pfaff, forcing him out of the post."

(AP)\n\nCanada is seeking a peaceful end to a rail blockade that has shut down freight and passenger traffic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday, amid increasing pressure from business leaders and the Conservative opposition to clear the tracks.\n\nFor almost two weeks, protesters across the country have taken up the cause of the Wet’suwet’en indigenous people of western British Columbia in their campaign against the C$6.6 billion ($4.98 billion) Coastal GasLink project.\n\nIn Ontario, Tyendinaga Mohawk protesters have stopped service along a major eastern Canada rail line.\n\n“I know that people’s patience is running short. We need to find a solution and we need to find it now,” Trudeau told legislators in parliament. The dispute should be settled by “dialogue and mutual respect” and not through force, he added.\n\nCanadian National Railway Co (CN) has obtained a court injunction to end the blockade in Ontario, but police have so far refrained from using force to uphold it. CN said on Tuesday it was temporarily laying off about 450 people and progressively shutting down operations in eastern Canada due to the blockade.\n\nPolice in British Columbia did clear out protesters, turning the situation into a flashpoint for indigenous demonstrators. The standoff is testing\n\nTrudeau’s pledge to repair Ottawa’s relations with First Nations and champion their causes. The disruption comes as other major energy projects that will affect indigenous peoples hang in the balance, including the construction of the Trans Mountain pipeline and the decision on whether to approve Teck Resources Ltd’s Frontier oil sands project.\n\nAndrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, said Trudeau’s response to a national crisis has been weak. “No one has the right to hold our economy hostage,” Scheer said.\n\nThe rail stoppage has led to a shortage of propane and other goods, and on Tuesday farmers warned they have not been able to get their products to ports. “Interruptions in rail service amplifies the stress that farmers and rural communities are under, creating a huge amount of uncertainty in their day-to-day lives,” said Mary Robinson, the president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture.\n\n“We see the blockade does have real economic impacts,” Finance Minister Bill Morneau said, without quantifying the damage.\n\nMore than 30 chiefs of Canadian business associations on Tuesday urged Trudeau to negotiate an immediate end to the blockades, according to a joint letter sent to the prime minister.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "content": "KARACHI: A team from Pakistan Navy trained in nuclear, biological and defence matters carrying out chemical analyses in the Customs House on Tuesday.—PPI\n\nKARACHI: As the federal and provincial agencies continued their hitherto unsuccessful efforts to determine the source and place of a toxic gas leak in a neighbourhood of Karachi, the death toll from the leak rose to 14 on Tuesday.\n\nWith many persons hospitalised since Sunday, when the leak was first noticed, the people of the affected areas took to the streets, accusing the administration of paying only lip service over the grave issues involved.\n\n• Traders reject report blaming soya bean consignments\n\n• Commissioner says ship carrying soya bean has been moved away from Karachi port\n\n• PSO closes Keamari oil terminal\n\nAfter a brief respite on Monday, the situation began deteriorating again in the early hours of Tuesday when a number of people, including women and children, were rushed to private and government hospitals. This exercise continued till sunrise. Finally in the evening, the Sindh health ministry came up with the latest casualty figures.\n\n“To conclude the report, 14 patients expired from Feb 16 to 18, till signing of this report at 6.30pm,” said the special health secretary in his report to Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah.\n\n“It is pertinent to mention that 258 patients were examined and 232 were discharged after treatment and 12 patients are under observation in relevant hospitals. The specimens of the patients were collected and sent to Aga Khan University Hospital and ICCBS for further investigation and analytical study.”\n\nThe efforts to determine the cause or even the exact place of gas leak failed to bring anything to conclusion. Interestingly, the government even failed to bring the investigation agencies to the same page when it came to their findings.\n\nThe International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences at the University of Karachi suspected that “soybean dust (aeroallergens)” was behind the problem. However, a study conducted by a private laboratory assisting the Sindh environment authorities spoke of high levels of hydrogen sulfide and nitric oxide in the air.\n\n“The air quality monitoring conducted over the past two days by a private laboratory in the affected areas of Keamari found the air extremely polluted, but the levels of pollutants, particularly two harmful gases, didn’t cross the limits where they could endanger a human life,” said a source privy to the study conducted by the private laboratory.\n\nAmid confusing statements from different agencies, the people of Keamari, including the Railway Colony, Sikandarabad, Jackson Market and Masaan Road, continued to suffer as the authorities only promised to evacuate them without proper planning and arrangements on ground.\n\nPanic and fear\n\nThe situation sparked a protest when hundreds of Keamari residents took to the streets and blocked the main road, suspending traffic to and from the Karachi Port Trust premises.\n\n“The situation is such a mess,” said Jamal Khan, a protester and resident of the Railway Colony. “We should be ashamed that in this modern age we are unable to find the exact cause and place of all this poisonous gas. Are they doing this deliberately to conceal the truth?\n\n“Above all, we are promised over television by the government of evacuation from these affected areas but no one has come yet to visit our streets and neighbourhoods.”\n\nThe situation arising out of the protest took more than three hours to normalise and the people dispersed after the local administration made several promises. But panic and fear didn’t lessen.\n\nA majority of the schools in the affected areas and neighbouring blocks announced a holiday for the rest of the week and the state-run oil marketing company decided to suspend operations at its oil terminal in Keamari.\n\n“The Pakistan State Oil has decided to keep its oil terminal in Keamari closed temporarily,” said the company spokesman.\n\n“The move has been made only as a precautionary measure for safety and health of our staff. This temporary suspension would not affect our supply and it would continue unaffected across the country.”\n\nChief Minister Shah acknowledged that authorities had been unable to determine the cause of the toxic gas leak, which he said had not spread to other parts of the city. He called it a “mystery” but insisted that all institutions concerned were involved in efforts to unearth the cause of the incident.\n\n“I am thankful to Pak Army, Sindh Police, district administration and health department who all have worked together to unearth the causes of the gas leak,” said Mr Shah, adding: “Pakistan Navy and Suparco are conducting lab tests of the wind and samples of various oils and goods cargos being downloaded at KPT.”\n\n“The lab results would definitely resolve the issue,” he hoped.\n\nMeanwhile, traders have rejected the report which blamed consignments of soybean as cause of the toxic air. They claimed to have met all quality checks defined under the law and said the consignment was believed to be of highest quality.\n\n“The vessel contains merchantable soybean of US origin, which is of highest quality and was shipped after the usual stringent quality tests by the US Department of Agriculture,” said a statement issued by the All Pakistan Solvent Extractors’ Association.\n\n“Upon arrival into Pakistan, the vessel was thoroughly inspected by the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) which found no quality issues. Therefore, the question of the cargo causing any toxicity to the environment does not arise.”\n\nThe claims from the traders, however, failed to convince the authorities who ordered removal of the ship carrying soybean from the Karachi Port to other destination.\n\n“The ship carrying soybean has been removed from the KPT to other destination,” said Karachi Commissioner Iftikhar Shallwani. “We have already taken all necessary precautionary measures in collaboration with health department and all other concerned institutions.”\n\nA spokesman for the CM House, meanwhile, said that any final decision about evacuation or other steps would be taken in a meeting of the Sindh cabinet on Wednesday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 19th, 2020"

            "content": "The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to start land acquisition for the Karur-Coimbatore bypass road shortly.\n\nAn official of the NHAI said the Collectors of three districts through which the road will pass through had approved of the alignment in 2018, and the consultant is expected to give the land acquisition details next week. This will give a clear picture of the total land required.\n\nThe officials made a presentation to the Coimbatore District Collector recently, at the District Road Safety Committee meeting and it is learnt that they were asked to review the alignment.\n\n“We made a presentation at the meeting to give an idea about the project. But the alignment is already approved,” the official claimed.\n\nHowever, farmers, the Coimbatore MP and some officials too, have objected to the ₹ 3,500 crore project.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coimbatore Member of Parliament (MP) P.R. Natarajan and several farmers submitted a memorandum to Coimbatore District Collector K. Rajamani saying the existing road between Karur and Coimbatore should be widened rather than taking up a greenfield project.\n\nMr. Natarajan told The Hindu that according to details provided by the NHAI officials earlier, nearly 2,000 acres of agriculture land will have to be acquired for the project and it will reduce the distance for those travelling from Karur to Coimbatore by just six km. This too is according to the NHAI estimate.\n\n“There seems to be a hidden agenda behind many of these road projects. It looks like these are taken up to benefit a few people. The Pollachi MP and I have already registered our objection to the project. There is a lot of government land that can be used to to widen the existing road. But the NHAI is not keen on doing it because only if a new road is developed can it come under toll collection,” he said.\n\nAccording to K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause who is also a member of the road safety committee, the project was not presented in any road safety committee meeting earlier. Hence, the members do not know when the Collector approved it. There should be transparency about the project and the approvals given. Many of the officials had expressed their reservation to the project and its alignment at the recently-held meeting of the committee. The existing road should be widened rather than taking up such a project. If there is toll collection on the new road, users will start using the existing road and the new one will remain under-utilised, he said."

City leaders said the innovation center could be a cornerstone for affordable housing, public art and other changes along the historic Mobile Street.\n\n“I was here during the civil rights march,” said Desmond Wilson, director of economic and community development for the city of Montgomery. “I was actually sitting in my mother’s lap as the march (from Selma to Montgomery) came down this particular street, and I was in this community when it was vibrant.”\n\nWilson said he sees the innovation center as a way to help revitalize the area with new growth and development, WSFA-TV reported."

            "content": "Corruption is deeply embedded in Hungary, with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán shielded by a cluster of wealthy bosses with close personal and political ties to the leader, writes Szabolcs Panyi.\n\nSzabolcs Panyi is a journalist at Direkt36, a non-profit investigative journalism centre in Budapest, Hungary, and a guest author for the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s BTI project.\n\n“God, luck and Viktor Orbán certainly played a role in what I’ve achieved so far,” is how Lőrinc Mészáros, the Hungarian prime minister’s childhood friend explained his unprecedented business success back in 2014.\n\nThree years later, Mészáros became an international sensation as his flagship company made headlines for having the world’s best-performing stock, thanks to its continuous profit from a flood of government contracts.\n\nBy 2020, Mészáros has risen from an uncharismatic gas fitter in Felcsút, Orbán’s hometown of 1,800 people, to become Hungary’s richest individual with a net worth of around 1.3 billion euros, according to a Forbes Hungary estimate.\n\nHe is a symbol of what the Prime Minister calls “the reinforcement of the national capitalist class”, a web of nouveau-riche, government-friendly entrepreneurs with close personal and business ties to senior right-wing politicians’ families.\n\nMészáros famously once told a journalist who asked about the secret of his success that “maybe I’m smarter” than Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nOpposition figures and pundits simply regard Mészáros as a straw man fronting for Orbán, an allegation both of them vehemently deny. Investigative journalists, however, have revealed direct evidence of public money flowing to Orbán’s family through Mészáros’s companies.\n\n“Instead of classic state capture where economic interests take over a weak executive, in Hungary a powerful executive cooperates in a non-transparent manner with business circles that it has itself created. The governing elite and economic actors around it govern as their private interests dictate,” writes the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Transformation Index (BTI) in its 2020 country report on Hungary, due to be released in March.\n\nThis peculiar political-economic system, however, is a relatively new phenomenon in the country.\n\nShifting forms of corruption\n\nFor at least two decades after the democratic transition of 1989-1990, corruption in Hungary largely fit into regional patterns. Recent history of the entanglement between political and economic circles could be divided into at least three periods.\n\nDuring the 2000s when Hungary was basically a two-party system, “seventy-thirty” was the infamous expression describing behind-the-curtains deals between governing and opposition party blocs.\n\nWhoever was in power took the largest share of illicit profit (from shady public procurements and contracts) while making sure that businessmen supporting opposition parties were also well fed with public money.\n\nOne of the main architects of this equilibrium was Lajos Simicska, former party treasurer of Fidesz and owner of the largest right-wing media conglomerate. Orbán knew Simicska from high school, the two were close friends and political allies, supporting each other no matter what.\n\nBy 2010, with the landslide victory of Fidesz, Orbán’s right-wing party, parliamentary and municipal elections have essentially wiped out Hungary’s socialist and liberal parties from every position of power and influence.\n\nPrevious ”seventy-thirty” agreements became obsolete. Simicska, after carefully managing Fidesz’s economic hinterland for two decades, had the ambition to finally manage the affairs of the Republic of Hungary, despite never having been elected.\n\nThe second period lasted between 2010 and 2014, when Simicska indeed became the most influential person in Hungary, resulting in a somewhat still classic type of state capture.\n\nHe had enough power to pick or dismiss cabinet ministers and to influence legislation through controlling individual Fidesz MPs submitting new bills for him, which gradually put him on a collision course with Orbán.\n\nFrom 2015 until 2018, Simicska waged a turf war against the Prime Minister by throwing his support behind the far-right opposition party Jobbik and lost. After the 2018 elections, Lajos Simicska, an oligarch who fell out with Orbán, closed two openly anti-government newspapers and a radio station – a triumph for the prime minister.Then the third period began.\n\nThe age of the ‘national capitalist class’\n\n“He was smarter than any of us,” a young Orbán said of Simicska in an early interview in the late 1980s. Lőrinc Mészáros, who took over most of Simicska’s former companies after the oligarch opted for an exit in 2018, is a different breed.\n\nSo are other members of the newly-established national capitalist class, but none of them are likely to become as powerful and independent as Simicska used to be.\n\nTheir complete subordination to the Orbán government’s political will is best represented by how Mészáros and all other right-wing businessmen and corporations owning influential outlets simultaneously ditched their media assets worth millions of euros.\n\nThey transferred their media ownership rights to a newly set-up non-profit foundation which is overseen by a governing body full of Orbán loyalist appointees.\n\nAs BTI’s country report explains: “more than 400 titles, including most flagships of Fidesz’s media empire, were transferred to the central European press and media foundation (KESMA) in November 2018. This consolidation occurred as oligarchs linked to Fidesz donated their media shares to the foundation in quick succession”.\n\nBy 2020, the wide-ranging business empire of Mészáros and his lieutenants – sometimes defected managers of former Simicska-companies – includes interests in sectors as diverse as construction, agriculture, energy, media, finance, property holdings or tourism.\n\nA common thread is that these industries’ success is heavily reliant on government contracts, subsidies and favourable regulations. As a result, none of the “national capitalists” are able to go against the executive power’s will without risking everything they own. Another rebellion like Simicska’s is more than unlikely.\n\nOn the other hand, none of them are capable of producing high added-value products or are able to export and compete in the global market, thus raising big questions about their contribution to Hungary’s economic success."

            "content": "analysis\n\nOn 20 January the United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled that returning people to countries where their lives could be threatened by climate change may violate their human rights and be unlawful. This is a landmark ruling because it's the first time the committee has recognised that climate refugees exist. It opens the door to refugee protection for those whose lives are threatened by climate change.\n\nThe ruling acknowledges the severe challenges of climate change and puts pressure on nations to do more to prevent it and protect people from its effects. However many ambiguities remain about climate-linked migration, particularly in and from Africa.\n\nThe case was brought to the UN by Kiribati national Ioane Teitiota against New Zealand. Kiribati is a group of low-lying Pacific islands that don't rise higher than 3m above sea level. Climate change and rapid population growth have led to severe overcrowding, fresh water and food shortages, and violent land disputes.\n\nThe climate change risks included rising sea levels, saltwater contamination, flooding and land erosion. Teitiota requested asylum in 2010 on the basis that these effects posed a threat to his and his family's lives. New Zealand rejected his case and deported him in 2015.\n\nThe likelihood of mass international exodus is low - climate-linked migration is most often local\n\nBoth New Zealand and the UN committee agreed that the health of the Kiribati population had deteriorated due to climate change and that environmental drivers are not necessarily ruled out of the existing refugee laws.\n\nBut both also agreed that conditions weren't yet life threatening, and therefore Teitiota didn't meet the legal definition of a refugee. It's difficult to source water and grow nutritional crops, but not impossible. They further agreed that the risks he faced weren't personal, but generalised hardships shared by others.\n\nDespite upholding New Zealand's rejection and deportation order, the UN committee observed that environmental degradation, climate change and unsustainable development constituted some of the most pressing and serious threats to human rights. Environmental conditions can deteriorate to a point where they may become incompatible with the right to life and dignity. Forcibly returning people would then trigger non-refoulement obligations and be unlawful.\n\nMedia coverage of the ruling has routinely referred to 'climate' or 'environmental' refugees, but these categories don't exist. People moving for climate-related reasons continue do so without legal protection. Most refugee laws - particularly the 1951 Refugee Convention - are outdated and were written for post-World War II Europe. Since then, the drivers, forms and consequences of migration have changed. Existing frameworks are no longer adequate in the context of globalisation and mass migration.\n\nThe UN upheld the standard that protection applies only when someone faces imminent risk of death\n\nThe UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) claims that the ruling supports its position that refugee laws cover climate change and that people fleeing the effects may have valid claims to international protection under existing laws. Their reluctance to call for new or updated laws reflects a protectiveness shared by most refugee advocates. In the current anti-migrant climate in many countries, any changes could result in reduced rather than expanded protections.\n\nWhile the UN committee ruling may have set a precedent for protecting environmental refugees, it upheld the standard that protection applies only to individual cases where someone faces imminent risk of death.\n\nA dissenting opinion published by Ugandan committee member Duncan Muhumuza Laki argued that the threshold for 'a threat to life' is unreasonably high: 'It would indeed be counterintuitive to the protection of life to wait for deaths to be very frequent and considerable in order to consider the threshold of risk as met.'\n\nWhereas conditions in Kiribati are otherwise stable, climate change in Africa - despite being one of the hardest-hit regions - can rarely be isolated as the primary migration driver. The causes of migration are many and complex and often include economic, political and social factors. Some are partially or wholly affected by climate change.\n\nAccurate predictions of how many climate-linked migrants will exist are difficult to make\n\nBurkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger - the Group of Five (G5) Sahel countries - are already experiencing some of the worst climate change effects. These include increased temperatures, more frequent droughts, prolonged heat waves, soil degradation, increased flooding and reduced agricultural productivity.\n\nThe region has had the most substantial and sustained decline in rainfall recorded globally. Communities depend heavily on rain-fed agriculture and pastoralism. The G5 also face rapid population growth, abject poverty and underdevelopment, violent extremism, organised crime, poor governance and weak institutions - all exacerbated by the effects of climate change.\n\nThe G5 Sahel countries experience high migration, in the region and to Europe. The correlation between climate change and migration remains unclear, partly due to a lack of historical and current migration and climate data. Still, few migrants from the region could isolate climate change as the primary reason for migrating.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Climate Conflict Environment By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Fear of uncontrolled mass migration has partly fuelled restrictive responses and anti-migrant sentiment rather than considered, measured responses.\n\nThe likelihood of mass international exodus is in fact low. Climate-linked migration is most often local and circular. Migration is one of the key coping strategies when families lose agricultural productivity. International migration requires financial and logistical resources that most people lack.\n\nMovement is most often from rural areas to the closest possible urban areas as production diminishes. Families are likely to send some members and not whole groups, and rely on remittances to boost agricultural production. Similarly, in the event of natural disasters, most people flee to the nearest possible alternative until they can return.\n\nThe UN committee ruling will ideally lead countries to invest more in preventing the effects of the climate crisis, and to measured rights-based responses to climate-linked migration grounded in evidence instead of fear.\n\nAimée-Noël Mbiyozo, Senior Research Consultant, Migration, ISS Pretoria"

In the ’70s, he disbanded The Band. Now in the 2020s, his documentary is “Once Were Brothers.”\n\n“I’m 76 years old and just had my busiest year. I scored ‘The Irishman’ for Martin Scorsese.\n\n“I started at 13. Toronto. A theater guy wanted a rock band to play before his movie went on. A couple of us were juiced. We played our hearts out. We were learning. We knew nothing. I was scared, probably lousy, but so busy trying to remember the arrangements I didn’t know the difference.\n\n“I’m from Canada. Half-Indian, half-Jewish. My father, Jewish. My mother, Native American. From Six Nations reservation. Six tribes. A woman, Ava Hill, my friend, was our chief. I go there and do things for the young people. I teach them to speak up. Do what makes them proud.\n\n“That’s how music came into my life. These people were all about singing, dancing. Early years on the reservation, a time with relatives, is where I learned music. And storytelling.\n\n“I have a great memory. My autobiography, a best seller, pulled no punches. Hardest thing I ever did. You tell a story. Certain things you can do, certain you can’t. I was honest. I tried to have grace. I don’t think I hurt anyone … but no guarantees. You can be soulful — it just depends on what kind of soulful.\n\n“Now I’m just happy to have a breather. I’m scoring so many movies that I rarely get a weekend off. I tried working with a machine, but can’t. I need pen and paper.\n\n“I usually don’t like these musical documentaries. I wasn’t expecting to do this one … but … it’s very moving and emotional.”\n\nNot the first time we’ve heard this ‘Story’\n\nAfter weeks of fine-tuning, even East Siders will jam Broadway Theatre’s opening of “West Side Story.”\n\nCommanding the front mezzanine will be the musical’s original Maria, Carol Lawrence, age 87. Remembering her 1957 Winter Garden opening down the block:\n\n“After the finale, lights went out, curtain came up, we looked at the audience, and they looked at us … pure silence. Then, as if Jerome Robbins himself directed them, they stood screaming, cheering, stomping their feet. Leonard Bernstein hugged me. We wept.”\n\nSocial circle\n\nVacuuming up Burpy Sanders’ rear end makes voters believe de Blasio’s front end wants to be chief of staff. And who else might comprise BS’s cabinet?\n\nSecretary of the treasury, AOC. Because she handled tips as a bartender. Secretary of state, the Squad’s open mouth Rep. Ilhan Omar. Attorney general could be whichever lawyer’s released first. Agriculture, Spitting Bull Elizabeth Warren.\n\nSecretary of the interior, like way back inside — Buttigieg. Exterior? Shifty Schiff because he’s an ass. Posterior? Nadler. And inferior? Pelousy.\n\nOdds & ends\n\nJames Patterson’s latest Little, Brown best seller is “Lost.” If you love crime stories, mystery books, do not let this get lost. It’s a thriller … Dame Helen Mirren: “My nickname Popper came from when I was a baby. I was a loud crier, always waking people up. They’d say, ‘There she goes, popping off again.’ ”\n\nGarment District joke: Elderly lady, weary after 12 hours hand-sewing appliques onto a designer coat, trudges home.

            "content": "NEW DELHI: Following the inability of the central ministries to spend even half of the Rs. 1.3 lakh crore earmarked for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes , the government is planning to revamp the ‘development action plan’ and has proposed a non-lapsable dedicated fund on the lines of Nirbhaya Fund The social justice and empowerment ministry and tribal affairs ministry have mooted a complete revamp of Developmental Action Plan for Scheduled Castes (DAPSC) and Scheduled Tribe Component (STC) — an initiative under which 41 central ministries earmark 2-20% of their budget outlay for SC-ST welfare schemes. The ministries are required to identify targeted schemes and then earmark funds scheme-wise to different states. In 2019-20, the ministries allocated Rs. 81,340.74 crore for SC welfare and Rs. 51,283.53 crore for ST welfare. However, the utilisation has been poor. With the financial year set to end in about a month, only 56% of funds allocated for SC welfare and 62% for STs have been utilised. The plan for revamp includes reducing the number of ministries from 41 to 11, which would include the two nodal ministries of social justice and tribal affairs, an official said.With this, the government hopes to address the issue of funds lapsing due to the inability of the ministries to identify the targeted schemes. For instance, department of telecommunications has utilised only 1% of funds for SC welfare and zero for STs. Even the utilisation is being questioned. In many cases, funds are utilised in general schemes like building national highways or mid-day meal, with the assumption that the benefits would percolate to SCs and STs.The plan, reviewed by ET, proposes identifying eight key sectors — education, skill development, incomegenerating activities, agriculture, health, nutrition, infrastructure and housing — for fixing allocation. The proposal is to annul DAPSC and STC, and set up a central fund under the finance ministry. Eleven ministries that would be roped in as nodal ministries, according to the plan, to oversee implementation of schemes in the eight sectors are: Social justice and empowerment, tribal affairs, rural development, human resource and development, agriculture, skill development, MSME, health, housing and urban affairs, textiles and women and child development. The remaining 30 ministries that would be removed from the ambit would witness budget cuts accordingly, the plan proposes.A senior official said: “Many of these ministries do not have schemes for direct benefit to SCs, calling for reallocation of these amounts to other ministries… Many of these releases are continuing as notional releases, with no clear outcomes...”"

Suddenly, many mutual fund investors are thinking of diversifying and include at least one international fund in their mutual fund portfolio. However, mutual fund managers and advisors are asking investors to proceed cautiously.The international fund category has offered 14.40% returns in the last one year, 8.68% in three years and 6.34% in five years. The top 6 schemes in this category have given above 25% returns in the last one year. A close look at the category shows that the top ten schemes follow different investment strategy . They invest in diverse markets, commodities, and have disparate investment mandates.Here are the top 10 schemes on the 1-year return chart and where they invest:“International fund category is a highly diverse category. Investors shouldn’t make the mistake of chasing returns in such schemes,” says Raunak Onkar, international fund manager, PPFAS. “It is a high-risk category. Apart from having a high risk-appetite, investors should also be aware to sail through the volatility in such schemes,” adds Raunak Onkar.Onkar manages the overseas investment in Parag Parikh Long Term Equity Fund that manages assets worth Rs 2,784 crore as on Jan 31st, 2020. The scheme has offered 17.12% returns in the last one year.Puneet Oberoi, Founder, Excellent Investment Advisors, says that even if you are an aggressive investor, you shouldn’t pick any scheme in the international fund category randomly to diversify your investments. Raunak Onkar also agrees with him. “We can say we need another re-categorisation exercise for this category. The category has funds across geographies and themes. But all of this is in one basket. There are world gold funds, world agriculture funds, China-centric funds, EM centric funds etc. So, choosing schemes on the basis of returns can hurt investors very badly,” Raunak Onkar says.Mutual fund advisors say investors who are interested to geographically diversify their investments by investing in overseas schemes should stick to safer funds if they don’t know much about the world markets.“In the international fund category, there are schemes that track NASDAQ and the broader US and European markets. These schemes are easy to track and not very volatile,” says Puneet Oberoi. He warns against focusing solely on returns and getting into risky overseas funds. “Many investors get into the toppers on the charts which can be a China fund or a commodities fund. This can be dangerous.”Raunak Onkar says if an investor is going to invest on the basis of returns alone, s/he would choose a China fund. However, an intelligent investor will not risk investing in such a scheme when coronavirus threat is on. He believes that smaller markets like Germany, Brazil etc are difficult to track in comparison to the USA. That’s why many mutual fund advisors like Puneet Oberoi suggest only the USA-centric funds to their clients.Mutual fund advisors also believe that regular investors should avoid funds that focus on smaller markets also due to the corporate governance issues. “Many a times, markets like India, China, Brazil outperform USA’s developed market. However, investors need to understand that you are diversifying to avoid the issues in the Indian markets. Emerging markets have similar governance issues. In this case, investing in a high-yielding Vietnam fund wouldn’t help you,” says Raunak Onkar. He adds that Europe and the USA are the two places where companies have high corporate governance standards."

            "content": "Food Fight: How 2 Trump Proposals Could Bite Into School Lunch\n\nEnlarge this image Jianan Liu for NPR Jianan Liu for NPR\n\nTwo pending rule changes meant to reduce what the Trump administration calls abuse of federal benefit programs could also mean hundreds of thousands of children lose access to free school meals.\n\nThe first proposed change: The Trump administration wants to tighten states' standards for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. States have long been able to simplify enrollment in SNAP, allowing families who live near poverty to apply for the benefit with less paperwork and somewhat more flexible rules to qualify. But the administration believes some households are getting benefits they don't deserve.\n\n\"Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,\" said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in July, when the change was proposed. \"That is why we are changing the rules, preventing abuse of a critical safety net system, so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's proposal would force states to tighten SNAP enrollment standards. As a result of the proposed change, USDA estimates more than 3 million people would lose access to food stamps.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with school lunches? Depends on who you ask.\n\n\"The truth is, the real impact of this rule on school lunches is virtually zero,\" Sam Adolphsen told the House Oversight Committee earlier this month. He's policy director for the Foundation for Government Accountability, a nonprofit group. \"In fact, in 34 states, not one single child will lose their school lunch eligibility as a result of this rule.\"\n\nAt the same hearing, sitting just a few feet away, Diane Sullivan told a different story. She is an anti-poverty advocate with the group Witnesses to Hunger and has two sons in high-school. \"Without SNAP, in addition to having less food at home, my sons could lose access to free school meals,\" she said, calling the move \"a gutshot to those least equipped to take the blow or to fight back.\"\n\nSullivan and Adolphsen clearly see these cuts differently. Who's right?\n\nLet's start with the Trump administration's official estimate of the move's nationwide impact. The USDA says, as a result of tightening SNAP standards, 40,000 children will lose access to free and low-cost school meals. Hundreds of thousands more will lose free meals but still qualify to eat at a reduced cost. Sullivan says her two high-schoolers likely fall into this group. \"That's $252,\" she said, \"an annual expense my already overwhelmed budget cannot absorb.\"\n\nAdvocates are worried about one more big problem: When those 3 million people lose access to SNAP, the children among them will also lose their automatic access to free school meals. Instead, they will have to apply.\n\nIn 2004, Congress passed a law requiring that school districts automatically enroll children in the free school lunch program if their families already receive SNAP benefits. No application needed. Paperwork can be an enormous barrier for low-income families, and lawmakers agreed: Failing to fill out a form should never keep a child from eating. But that is exactly what advocates fear will happen now, under the administration's new rule.\n\nAccording to the government's own estimate, the change could push as many as 942,000 eligible children out of the lunch program, at least temporarily.\n\n\"Food is one of the most important school supplies a child has,\" said Lisa Davis, of the No Kid Hungry campaign, who also appeared before the Oversight Committee.\n\nShe said limiting access to free or reduced-price school meals could have big consequences for students: \"It exacerbates all of the other problems hungry children face: diminishing their academic performance, their mental and physical health, and their opportunity to achieve their full potential.\"\n\nPerdue says the administration is trying to make sure those who need the help most are the ones getting it. In defending the change, lawmakers have repeatedly cited the story of one man, Rob Undersander. The Minnesota millionaire says he received SNAP benefits for a year and a half because, he says, as a retiree he had little income and his considerable assets weren't taken into account. Undersander says he wanted to highlight waste in the program and get \"the law changed in Minnesota so that the money goes to the truly needy.\"\n\n\"I am not a fraud,\" Sullivan told lawmakers. She said SNAP benefits had been vital to her family but that, under the new rule, their household income would disqualify them. Last year, during a period when Sullivan was not enrolled in SNAP, she said the family car needed repairs. \"The fruit bowl on my kitchen table often sat empty. I stretched the meat and veggies intended for one meal into two. My fear is that we will be pushed back into the same situation if this rule is implemented.\"\n\nIn a statement, the USDA points out that most children affected by the rule change — 96% — would still qualify to receive either free or low-cost school meals; families would simply need to submit the paperwork.\n\n\"All households have the opportunity to fill out an individual application for free and reduced-priced meals as schools are required to make the applications available,\" the statement reads. \"This opportunity is available at any point throughout the entire school year and only needs to be done once per school year, typically at the start when parents are filling out other school forms.\"\n\nBut child advocates say this paperwork burden could keep eligible kids from eating.\n\n\"Experience tells us that far too many will fall through the cracks,\" Davis told lawmakers. \"Confusion about eligibility, complex paperwork, human error and stigma all create barriers to enrollment.\"\n\nSince the administration posted its proposed rule, as it is required to do, there have been nearly 184,000 public comments. So many, in fact, that the rule is not expected to be finalized until the spring.\n\nThe other big change the Trump administration is pushing would also drive children out of the school lunch program. The Department of Homeland Security has proposed stiffening the nation's public charge rule to require aspiring citizens to prove they won't rely on public assistance, including SNAP.\n\nWhile non-citizens don't qualify for most federal benefits, many live in households with someone who does, often a U.S.-born child who can legally receive SNAP benefits. But, again, if parents withdraw from SNAP, out of fear that receiving the benefit will block their path to citizenship, their children will also lose automatic enrollment in the school meals program.\n\n\"It's a huge barrier because this has frightened a lot of people,\" says Patricia Gándara, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. \"We hear from folks in the schools where these children are attending that the parents won't come in and sign up for the free lunch. And so school personnel know that the children are eligible, but the parents won't sign the forms because parents are also very afraid of signing anything that looks like they are using any benefit for fear of losing their status, their green cards.\"\n\nWhile the impact of this rule change is difficult to quantify, since it won't go into effect until late February, one study by the Urban Institute found that a fear of the public charge rule has already had a chilling effect on some immigrant families.\n\nThe rule technically excludes benefits received by children, but many parents either don't know this, or simply don't trust the government. While the new rule has been the subject of a heated legal battle, the U.S. Supreme Court recently voted 5-4 that it could go into effect later this month.\n\nThere's one last way these rule changes could affect students: by hitting schools' bottom line.\n\nThe school lunch program includes a provision that allows schools that serve a lot of low-income students to provide free meals to everyone — without having to collect individual applications. The provision saves schools time spent processing paperwork, and it eliminates the stigma some students feel around receiving a free meal.\n\nFor a school to qualify, at least 40% of its students must be certified to receive free meals. But if these new rule changes push too many children off of school meals — and they fail to re-enroll — some schools could drop below that 40% threshold and lose the ability to provide free meals to all. As many as 2,100 schools nationwide could be at risk. The needs of their children won't have changed — just the school's ability to serve them.\n\nThe proposed changes could even hurt schools' bottom line beyond the cafeteria. Districts receive extra help from the federal government, in the form of Title I dollars, to serve vulnerable, low-income students. But the government measures this vulnerability — and allocates those extra dollars — based on enrollment in the school meals program.\n\n\"If you have students leaving the free and reduced-price lunch program, who should be participating, you will underestimate the number of low-income students served in a school,\" says John King, head of the Education Trust and a former education secretary under President Obama, \"and the school will therefore get less funding.\""
