Additionally, the label's trench coat factory in Castleford, Yorkshire, has been re-purposed to make non-surgical gowns and masks for patients.\n\nThe label is also funding vaccine research at the University of Oxford and donating to the charities FareShare and The Felix Project to combat food poverty.\n\nBrooks Brothers followed suit, announcing on Instagram Monday that the American company's factories in New York, North Carolina and Massachusetts will pivot from making from ties, shirts and suits to manufacturing masks and gowns. The company expects to produce 150,000 masks per day.\n\n“We consider this a duty, and part of our DNA at Brooks Brothers,\" said CEO Claudio Del Vecchio in a statement. \"We are deeply grateful to the medical personnel at the frontlines who are fighting the pandemic, and we are honored to do our part and join our peers in retail to provide protective masks that our healthcare system critically needs.”\n\nMore ways to cope:100 things to do while stuck inside due to a pandemic\n\nNordstrom also announced on the company's website Friday that it has partnered with Kaas Tailored to provide Providence Health & Services with more than 100,000 sanitized masks.\n\nThe luxury conglomerate LVMH, which owns several fashion houses including Christian Dior, Fendy, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs, announced on March 21 plans to use its global redistribution network to provide more than 40 million masks in the coming weeks.\n\nSimilarly, the Kering Group, which owns the fashion houses Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Brioni, announced on March 24 plans to manufacture masks. On March 22, the conglomerate said it will purchase and import three million surgical masks from China for healthcare workers in France.\n\nPrada began the production of 80,000 medical overalls and 110,000 masks March 18 at its factory in Montone, Italy, the company announced on March 23.\n\nAnother designer who has pledged to help is Christian Siriano, who tweeted at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on March 20 his offer to make masks for hospital workers to help with the shortage.\n\n\"If @NYGovCuomo says we need masks my team will help make some. I have a full sewing team still on staff working from home that can help,\" Siriano wrote.\n\nCuomo thanked the designer, saying he appreciated \"his help so much\" and called on other businesses to get creative in case they're able to help with supply shortages.\n\nSince his offer to Gov. Cuomo, Siriano has posted multiple tweets about all of the masks he and his workers have been able to produce. On March 26, he wrote that his company made 1,000 masks in three days.\n\nCoronavirus cancellations: Rolling Stones, 'Black Widow,' ZZ Top, 'SNL,' more postponements\n\nContributing: Sara M Moniuszko"

The sobering new forecasts reinforced the need to follow the protocols set by health experts, including social distancing and staying at home as much as possible. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said those numbers could be greatly reduced if everyone does their part: “We really believe we can do a lot better than that,” Birx said.\n\nIn Europe, France and the U.K. reported 500 deaths in a single day for the first time since the outbreak, while Spain passed 100,000 cases. The United Nations said the world is facing its worst crisis since World War II.\n\n“This is the moment to dismantle trade barriers, maintain open trade, and re-establish supply chains,” the U.N. said in a report, that called from “a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response amounting to at least 10% of global GDP.”\n\nChina, which appeared to be reopening for business after its mass quarantine efforts, ordered some public venues to close again as it moves to prevent a second wave of infections. China’s National Health Commission said it would start to include asymptomatic cases in its tally of confirmed cases. Until now, China has only counted people who exhibited symptoms of the illness, which include a sore throat, dry cough and fever.\n\nSee:Here’s what a team of Citi analysts say will save the global economy — and the stock market\n\nThe U.S. still has the highest number of cases of any country at 203,608. At least 4,476 Americans have died and 8,400 have recovered, according to data aggregated by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nGlobally, the data shows 911,308 cases, and at least 44,497 deaths. Italy has 110,574 cases and the highest death toll in the world at 13,155. Spain has 102,136 cases and at least 9,053 deaths.\n\nRead:Anthony Fauci: White House Coronavirus Task Force is giving ‘serious consideration’ to suggesting Americans wear face masks\n\nChina, where the virus was first identified late last year, has 82,361 cases, according to Johns Hopkins data, and 3,316 deaths. Germany now has 76,544 cases and 858 deaths, while France has 52,870 cases and 3,532 deaths. Iran has 47,593 cases and 3,036 deaths.\n\nNew York is still the U.S. epicenter with 83,712 cases as of Wednesday, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and 1,941 deaths in the state, up from 1,550 on Tuesday.\n\nThere are 12,226 New Yorkers in hospital with the virus, 3,022 of whom are in intensive care units. Another 6,142 people have been discharged, Cuomo told reporters at a daily briefing.\n\nOn Tuesday, the governor again slammed the federal government for its response to the crisis, this time by describing the scramble to get hold of much-needed ventilators. Cuomo said states are competing to order equipment with each other and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA.\n\nIt’s like “being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator,” Cuomo fumed to reporters.\n\nOn Wednesday, he said he hoped the federal government’s stockpile is sufficient to deal with the crisis, although based on a model created by McKinsey, New York will need 37,000 ventilators assuming the virus reaches a peak at the end of April. So far, the federal government has sent just 4,000, he said. China remains the main supplier of ventilators, as well as equipment such as masks, gloves and gowns. “China is selling to the world,” he said, lamenting that the U.S. does not make such basic supplies any more.\n\nThe New York Police Department said at least 1,200 officers and staff have tested positive for the virus, and five have died as of Tuesday, according to Commissioner Dermot F. Shea on a webcast. But the total number of infected officers could be far higher, as some 5,600 department employees called out sick on Tuesday, five times the usual daily volume. Sick police officers accounted for roughly 15% of the uniformed force, he said.\n\nSee:U.S. manufacturers see biggest plunge in new orders and employment in 11 years — ISM finds\n\nCompanies continued to announce fresh measures to combat the impact on their business of having most workers stay home. Retailers announced further or extended store closures, said they would furlough staff and pulled guidance. Analysts highlighted the advantage pizza companies have over other restaurants given they have delivery and digital infrastructure in place. MKM upgraded Papa John’s on that basis to buy.\n\nBernstein analysts raised their stock price target for Netflix and said they expect consumers will not want to give it up, once they get used to the wide range of programming and shows available in its library.\n\nRead now: What to stream in a pandemic?

CNC, -1.92% will cover the cost of COVID-19-related screening, testing, and for people who have its Medicare, Medicaid and health insurance exchange plans. It is also eliminating COVID-19-related copays and prior authorization requirements.\n\n• Children’s Place Inc. PLCE, +0.79% will furlough field managers and store employees starting April 5 and will suspend dividend and share buybacks. Stores have been closed since March 18 and will remain closed until further notice. The company plans on a combination of temporary furloughs and pay cuts for most of its corporate staff. Chief Executive Jane Elfers will forgo her salary and executives will take a temporary 25% pay cut, the company said.\n\n• Fashion clothing retailer Express Inc. EXPR, is furloughing most of its store workers as well as some corporate workers until its stores are able and allowed to reopen. The company is pausing pay for those workers but will continue to pay health care benefits. The company is significantly cutting costs and spending, is suspending merit pay increases for 2020 and freezing hiring.\n\n• Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.’s FCAU, -2.19% U.S. subsidiary, FCA U.S. LLC’s first-quarter sales fell 10% from a year ago, as “strong” momentum in January and February was offset by the negative economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic in March. U.S. sales fell to 446,768 vehicles from 498,425 a year ago. A bright spot for the auto maker was its Ram brand, which saw sales rise 3%, while Jeep brand sales fell 14%, Chrysler sales declined 5%, Dodge sales dropped 20%, Fiat sales slid 49% and Alfa Romeo sales shed 14%.\n\n• Gannett Co. Inc. GCI, -2.52% is suspending its quarterly dividend, in an effort to preserve liquidity. In late February, the USA Today parent said it planned to resume paying a quarterly dividend of 19 cents a share. Revenue is expected to be “significantly impacted” as advertising and events revenue are expected to decline. Gannett is looking to cut expenses by an additional $100 million to $125 million through job cuts and furloughs, “significant” pay reductions for senior management and the cancellation of nonessential travel and spending. The company is working with its vendors, creditors and pension regulators to restructure or postpone certain obligations.\n\n• General Motors Co.’s GM, -1.61% first-quarter deliveries fell 7% from a year ago to 618,335 vehicles, as the auto industry experienced “significant declines” in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Deliveries fell for all of GM’s brands, with Chevrolet down 3.8%, Buick down 34.7%, Cadillac down 15.8% and GMC down 5.5%. The model with the most deliveries was Chevrolet’s Silverado LD, as that increased 33.6% to 112,925 vehicles, followed by the Chevy Equinox, which dropped 17.0% to 73,453 vehicles. GM said inventory at the end of the first quarter was 668,443 vehicles, down 18% from last year.\n\n• Home Depot Inc. HD, -1.50% will close its stores early at 6 p.m., limit the number of customers allowed in its stores at one time, eliminate major spring promotions to avoid increasing traffic, distribute thermometers to employees in stores and ask for health checks before reporting to work. The retailer is adding 80 hours of paid time off for full-time hourly employees, 160 hours of paid time off for full-time hourly employees aged 65 or older and 40 hours of paid time off for part-time hourly employees. The company is providing additional bonuses of $100 a week for full-time hourly in-store employees and $50 a week for part-time employees, and providing paid time off for employees who have contracted COVID-19 and to employees required to be quarantined.\n\n• Kroger KR, -1.63% is one of the rare U.S. companies to stick with its 2020 guidance and expects same-store sales excluding fuel to exceed 2.25% and earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.40. Kroger has drawn down $1 billion from its revolving credit facility and has suspended share buybacks. Kroger also announced another bonus for front-line workers.\n\n• Match Group Inc.’s MTCH, -0.35% earnings will be at low end of guidance amid fewer new users. “We expect our Q1 results to be around the low end of the ranges we previously shared publicly,” company Chief Executive Shar Dubey warned in a regulatory filing.\n\n• Okta Inc. OKTA, -3.11% reaffirmed its revenue forecast for the current quarter and fiscal year, but management expects “near-term billings headwinds” as customers react to the uncertain situation. The company, which makes software that helps employees and others more easily sign into network applications, expects a narrower adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss than it previously modeled. For the fiscal first quarter, Okta expects an adjusted net loss of 16 cents to 17 cents, compared with a prior forecast for 23 cents to 24 cents. For the current fiscal year, management models a 31-cent to 36-cent adjusted net loss. Its earlier outlook for the period called for 37 cents to 42 cents.\n\n• Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. RRGB, +0.52% has drawn down what remains of its $300 million credit facility. The restaurant chain has a cash balance of $91 million as of the end of its last fiscal week on March 29. The company has suspended guidance for 2020, reduced executive base salaries and board retainer fees by 20% as of March 30, and postponed capital expenditures. Red Robin is still marketing its off-premise business, largely through digital channels.\n\nCoronavirus Update: ‘Hard Days’ Ahead and Global Deal-Making in Chaos\n\nAdditional reporting by Emily Bary, Tonya Garcia, Tomi Kilgore, Claudia Assis, Jon Swartz and Jaimy Lee"

            "content": "Like many other websites at the moment, the career-oriented networking platform LinkedIn has seen a big boost in traffic as a result of people being asked to work from home and stay indoors overall to slow the spread of the coronavirus, with a bump of 55% more conversational activity between existing connections in recent weeks. Now, to leverage that attention in a way that's more directly helpful during this health crisis, LinkedIn is introducing new measures specifically around job listings.\n\nFrom today and for the next three months, LinkedIn says it will provide free job postings for \"essential\" businesses globally -- companies in healthcare, as well as warehousing, supermarket, freight delivery and nonprofits working in support or relief roles -- in other words, those providing critical front-line services to keep the economy and society in motion. Healthcare will include companies working in areas like medical devices, medical practice (including hospitals) and mental health care.\n\nAlongside this, LinkedIn is creating an \"urgent jobs\" board to give these openings more priority visibility. People whose skills match up with those needed for these jobs who visit LinkedIn's jobs homepage will see the special listings highlighted. Those who sign up for job alerts with matching skills will in turn get real-time alerts of the jobs as they get posted.\n\nThe volunteer ads also link up with an expanded Recruiting for Good program to help bring in more people to work with nonprofits in both volunteer and paid roles. And those doing the recruiting will also get three months of free access to LinkedIn's talent insights tools to figure out where their (free) ads are best placed around hiring trends and more.\n\nOrganizations that have already signed up to use these include the American Red Cross of Los Angeles, the CommonSpirit Health hospital network, Doctors on Demand and New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nThe new initiatives underscore the bigger trend of how tech companies are looking to provide whatever assistance they can bring to the table in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n(Others include Google, which is trying to help with testing, while also providing a landing page for official and local information, while both Facebook and Twitter are trying to stamp out fake news while surfacing links to official organizations for help.)\n\nRecruitment -- which has traditionally been LinkedIn's biggest revenue generator (as part of Microsoft, it does not regularly report financials on its business lines) -- has been in an interesting position within that.\n\nOn the one hand, recruitment and its counterpart, employment, have been two of the essential levers in fighting this pandemic.\n\nOn the clinical front, hospitals and related care organizations are scrambling to keep up with the surge in demand for their services, leading to major recruitment drives to bring in people with relevant experience, in some cases going straight to the ranks of those who may have left the profession and now are being asked to step in again.\n\nIn the U.K., for example, some 4,500 doctors and nurses have so far answered an open call to come back into medical service (many will have moved on to other non-clinical or managerial roles in the NHS, or left the public sector, or the profession altogether, not just retired due to age), with more likely to come. And that's just on the clinical front. We're seeing a multitude of call outs across other sectors, like technology, to bring in experts in AI and other areas to help design software and hardware to slow the spread of the virus, to alleviate some of the side effects, to identify it faster and maybe even to potentially cure it.\n\nIn another vein, the closures of restaurants and public places has put a big shift on to supermarkets and other food providers to beef up their work forces to meet their rising demands. That's meant that while many people have lost their old jobs due to closures, they are getting opportunities to redeploy elsewhere.\n\n(The same goes for the collective groundswell of people who have emerged as volunteers to help others who are in need, with hundreds of thousands volunteering to help deliver medications or other essential tasks to supplement the work of front-line healthcare providers.)\n\nStory continues"

            "content": "SEATTLE—Strips of red tape, six feet apart, line the sidewalk outside the walk-up window at Chocolati Cafe. Business is steady on this sunny Sunday, despite the tables and chairs stacked up inside. Three baristas scramble to keep up with orders from an array of customers that stretches out more than 30 feet.\n\nGeordie Glass has just ordered his eight-ounce latte. He’s on his way to walk a lap of Green Lake across the street. “I do this almost every day now,” Glass, 45, told The Daily Beast. “I’m running out of things to do at home.”\n\nAt the lake, a steady stream of walkers, runners, skaters, and bikers share the three-mile path with gaggles of geese. Here, too, most people—if not the congregating geese—are adhering to the international trend toward social distancing.\n\nA reminder is posted by the trail: “Stay 6 feet or at least arm’s length away from others.”\n\nBut what was a sort of Northwestern curiosity as recently as a few weeks ago may not only outlast the wishes of GDP-fixated politicians like Donald Trump, but also become a regular—that is, intermittent—fact of American life. Taken together, recent COVID-19 forecasts suggest Americans should be ready not just for a months-long shutdown, but also to potentially return to the practice again.\n\nIn other words, some epidemiologists and other scientists closely studying the pandemic increasingly seem to be veering toward a long-term, multilayered approach—including repeated periods of social distancing.\n\n“It’s like a fire. If you don’t completely put it out, it will come back. You have to keep suppressing it,” Michael Osterholm, professor and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told The Daily Beast.\n\nMore than 250 million Americans have been ordered to “shelter in place” or stay at home in hopes of quelling COVID-19. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D)—whose initial order in America’s first state with a confirmed case of the disease was set to expire on April 8—said last week that the effort would be extended. He and local authorities have also introduced piecemeal measures: In addition to schools, dine-in restaurants, bars, and other nonessential businesses, closures now include many trailheads, playgrounds, even boat-launch sites.\n\nNew data suggest the social-distancing efforts have slightly slowed the rate of increase in new COVID-19 infections across the state—that there’s hope here. “We have to hammer this until we can be assured it will not spring back up,” Inslee said.\n\nBut just how hard and how long to hammer remains up for debate. A pair of reports released Monday by the Bellevue-based Institute for Disease Modeling found that social-distancing policies have curtailed the movement of people around King County, Washington, and significantly slowed the spread of COVID-19. Still, the models suggest “evidence of fluctuating adherence” leaves the county in a “precarious position,” according to its authors.\n\nThat data followed analyses released Thursday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. As of Tuesday, it forecast U.S. deaths to total more than 83,000 by July, even with social-distancing measures in place. “It’s working and it will work even better if we do much more of it,” Ali Mokdad, a scientist at IHME and contributor to the analyses, told The Daily Beast. “In many places, even in Seattle, people are not 100 percent adherent to staying at home. We have to stay vigilant at least through mid-May.”\n\nEven that may not be enough. Still more research released last week by a Harvard team suggested a successful battle against COVID-19 was also unlikely to be waged in a single shot.\n\nThe authors of the paper, a preprint posted at medrxiv.org that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, determined that one long period of stringent social distancing could potentially backfire in a greater resurgence of infections come fall and winter, unless other interventions are put in place. The finding was consistent with the course of the 1918 influenza pandemic, during which cities that had low peaks during the first wave of infections—thanks in large part to social-distancing measures—were at a greater risk of a higher second wave after those interventions were lifted.\n\nModels detailed in the Harvard paper point to cycled periods of social distancing as a potentially better way to minimize the overall toll on the population, achieve greater “herd immunity,” and take pressure off already-strapped intensive-care units (ICUs).\n\nThe approach may also provide a welcome summer respite for Seattleites, New Yorkers, and other Americans who are going stir crazy—or facing economic hardship, large or small. “Any kind of reprieve would be welcome,” said Glass, who works as a physician assistant in radiology—now 30 hours a week due to reductions in elective surgeries in response to the pandemic. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs entirely, and millions more are expected to in the coming days.\n\nRather than fully releasing the brakes, according to the Harvard models, officials may eventually want to start pumping them—strategically letting up on social distancing as ICU beds empty, and then re-enacting measures as beds fill back up. The idea, in part, would be to steadily build up population immunity while not overwhelming critical-care capacity.\n\n“What we find is that those social-distancing efforts that are relatively successful in flattening the curve end up pushing the peak out,” Yonatan Grad, an infectious-disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the paper, told The Daily Beast. “If there is seasonality, and if the peak gets pushed into the fall, we will see an even higher peak.”\n\nSeasonal changes in temperature and humidity, as well as a return to school and indoor crowding during cooler months, are among factors that may increase transmission of the virus. Grad said the best-case scenario, based partly on achieving an optimistic doubling of ICU capacity, would mean social-distancing measures need to be in place 25 percent of the time over the next nine to 10 months. The worst-case scenario, according to the models, is two years of cycled social distancing.\n\nSuffice it to say that might be a tough sell. “The public’s acceptance of this kind of a shutdown two or three times does not seem likely,” said Howard Markel, director of the University of Michigan’s Center for the History of Medicine.\n\nThe models highlighted by Grad assume that the spread of COVID-19 will slow during summer months, as it did for SARS, a previous coronavirus. (While scientists suspect that seasonality is again likely with this virus, they currently lack the data to be certain.) Improved capacity for testing and containment should also lessen the need for social distancing—as would treatments or dissemination of a safe and effective vaccine, the ultimate goal, which isn’t expected for perhaps 18 months.\n\n“We’re buying time until a vaccine,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chairwoman of the homeland security project at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “Social distancing is to get on the other side of the curve, then we can begin mitigation efforts. We need a multilayered approach to managing living with the virus during this time.”\n\nKayyem underscored another limitation of the models: They assume a “united social distancing effort,” which is far from the case in the U.S., where some states and communities are trying different combinations of interventions—if any — at different times.\n\nOverall, mathematical models “need to be seen with great caution, especially when epidemics are modeled,” noted John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at Stanford University, in an email to The Daily Beast. He, too, underscored the unknowns. If any one of a number of assumptions made by the Harvard researchers turn out to be wrong, he said, then their models could “collapse entirely.”\n\nBefore determining next steps, such as whether or not to stop lockdowns or social distancing measures, added Ioannidis, more unbiased data is needed on COVID-19, including its true incidence, fatality rate, and the proportion of infected people needing hospitalization.\n\nAnother remaining open question is whether or not people who recover from the virus could be susceptible to it later on. “We should not yet count on herd immunity,” said Mokdad. “We should count on social distancing. It will help us now and in the future.” His IHME team has not yet modeled the potential resurgence of the virus. “It’s on our to-do list,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the diversity of responses to COVID-19 both around the world and within the U.S. could itself provide useful information. Successful efforts in China, for example, have left a large population susceptible to the virus. How will that country fare in the months ahead? Will they face a resurgence of infections? On Friday, authorities once again closed all of China’s movie theaters, which had recently reopened after a two-month shutdown. The move has triggered speculation of a possible second wave of infections.\n\n“One of the things that needs to happen now is a better understanding of which social-distancing measures actually worked and how well,” said Grad, noting that sufficient data was still several weeks away. “Does it matter if we close schools? Or large sporting arena events? Or is what really matters getting rid of bars and restaurants and preventing even small groups from mixing?”\n\nHow about the impact of the selective measures instituted at a place like Green Lake Park? A sign attached to a barrier that blocks entrance to one of the Green Lake parking lots explains that the closure is “to reduce park use and help slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.” Along the lake’s perimeter, yellow tape wards people away from a children’s playground, exercise equipment, and swimming pool. Tape also spans from hoop-to-hoop down the length of an outdoor basketball court; the park’s tennis courts remain open and in full use.\n\nOn top of protecting the population, maintaining social distancing now will provide the time and data to fully investigate these questions, Grad argued. Such answers, which he noted will likely vary across communities, should not only help in choosing effective measures when they need to be implemented again, but could also inform how we emerge from social distancing.\n\n“There’s a smart way to do this that does not just involve stopping everything at once,” he added.\n\nOsterholm, the professor at the University of Minnesota, underscored the need to find a middle ground between suppressing infections completely for an extended period of time and letting the virus run its course through the population. Toward that end, he urged taking a “Manhattan Project-type approach”—bringing the best minds together to come up with a national plan, as soon as possible.\n\nRepeated periods of social distancing might not be popular. But neither would “promoting an 18-month total lockdown of the country,” he told The Daily Beast. “So, how do you try to thread a rope through this needle?”\n\nIf nothing else, messaging from on high teasing a longer timeline—and warning that more concerted shutdowns may be coming—could help the public wrap their heads around the idea.\n\n“If it was planned, that would help a lot. Then I could take time off from work, arrange childcare,” said Glass, of the potential for intermittent social distancing. “No one was prepared for this. They just said, ‘By the way, starting tomorrow, you can’t go out.’ That was pretty hard.”"

            "content": "As viral testing finally rolled out on a minute scale in the first week of March, the American public learned of pockets of community transmission of the disease all over the country—especially near Seattle and New York City. Stock markets continued their steep slide. Some institutions, such as schools and nursing homes, shut down; the National Guard was dispatched to help enforce quarantine conditions in the viral hot spot of New Rochelle, N.Y.\n\nThe president insisted the Chinese outbreak posed no threat to America—and some critics have labeled this call “the worst intelligence failure in U.S. history.”\n\nIt was clear that little was being done at the federal level to quell the spread of the virus—and citizens increasingly felt desperately thrown back on their own limited resources to contend with the specter of a long-term, lethal pandemic. By the time of Trump’s March 12 special address to the nation, much of the American public already knew the awful truth: that the entire Trump administration strategy for protecting them from Covid-19, which rested on airport controls to keep the virus out of the country, was a nonstarter. The virus was already all over America.\n\nDesperate to keep “the numbers where they are,” as the president put it in a press briefing at the CDC, the White House seemed determined to draw from the Xi Jinping playbook—censoring data, and clamping down on concern and dissent within the administration.\n\nAnd just as politics has largely dictated the woefully inadequate American response to the coronavirus threat, so will politics shape our reactions to this colossal governing failure. Our political system, together with the media ecosystem that relies on it, has grown notoriously polarized. The nation is facing a heated presidential election, and the coronavirus threat has supplied charged ideological fodder in political salvos from all sides. Until the first reports emerged of community-acquired Covid-19 cases within U.S. borders, America seemed satisfied to act as a collective epidemic voyeur, watching horror unfold in China and elsewhere overseas without anticipating its arrival domestically. As outbreaks exploded in South Korea, Iran, Japan, and Italy, anxiety rose in financial markets, fretting about quarantine conditions and supply-chain disruptions poised to extend well beyond the already collapsed production and distribution networks in China.\n\nAs longtime China-watcher Bill Bishop wrote for his website Sinocism, “We might be heading into [the] first global recession caused by [Chinese Communist Party] mismanagement. Previous manmade disasters in China since 1949 never really spread outside the PRC’s borders in meaningful ways. This time looks to be different, and being the proximate cause of a global recession may not be helpful to the PRC’s global image and aspirations.”\n\nChinese leaders clearly heeded this threat. China rolled out a propaganda campaign, accusing the United States of responsibility for the pandemic, and complaining that other world powers weren’t following its example.\n\nInside China, meanwhile, Xi waged a propaganda effort to shore up his damaged image as a great leader, visiting factories and hospitals. After one such visit, the state-run media issued this glowing report: “The inspection tour by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Wuhan, Central China’s Hubei province, has greatly inspired Chinese society. People interpret the visit in their own simple way, and optimism has blended with the atmosphere of spring.”\n\nEager to get his economy back on track, Xi ordered key factories and industrial centers reopened—only to have some efforts backfire. On March 11, as the South China Morning News described it, “At 8.30am the government of Qianjiang—which lies about 150 km (90 miles) east of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province—said that all restrictions on the movement of people and traffic would be lifted at 10am. They were.\n\n“Then, at 10.30am, they were reinstated.\n\n“‘The city will continue its restrictions on the movement of traffic and residents,’ the government said, without elaborating.”\n\nTwo days previously, well-known Chinese author Fang Fang wrote a tough essay, labeling the epidemic (not the virus) “man-made” and insisting, “Now is the best time for reflecting on what happened and investigating who is responsible.” Pointedly, she rejected CCP claims that the people should thank the party for stopping Covid-19. “A word that crops up frequently in conversation these days is ‘gratitude.’ High-level officials in Wuhan demand that the people show they’re grateful to the Communist Party and the country. I find this way of thinking very strange. Our government is supposed to be a people’s government; it exists solely to serve the people. Government officials work for us, not the other way around. I don’t understand why our leaders seem to draw exactly the opposite conclusion.”\n\nOutside the country, China waged a two-pronged effort: one showing its willingness to help the rest of the world, the other leveling accusations and blame. At the forefront of this PR offensive is the country’s United Nations Ambassador Zhang Jun. In a March 10 letter to all 192 member-states of the United Nations, Zhang wrote, “The spread of the epidemic has been basically contained in Hubei and Wuhan. We are ready to strengthen solidarity with the rest of the international community to jointly fight the epidemic.”\n\nCCP leadership noted that the “comprehensive, thorough and rigorous” measures China took to bring its epidemic to a halt could be shared with the rest of the world. And in the process, the CCP said, the governance of the United Nations and other international institutions would be improved.\n\nThat’s the polite side of China’s campaign. Beijing has instructed its ambassadors all over the world to raise doubts about the origin of the virus, calling it “the Italian virus,” or the “Japanese virus,” suggesting that it might even have been man-made. In a perverse mirror image of xenophobic anti-China conspiracy theories on the American right, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested the virus came out of an American laboratory. The White House responded with accusations about Chinese cover-ups and incompetence.\n\nHe also has tweeted and given speeches claiming that U.S. Army representatives brought the novel coronavirus to Wuhan in October 2019.\n\n“The US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!” one commentator said in response to Zhao’s postings. “The US owes the world, especially China, an apology,” another commentator said, and some on social media referred to the “American coronavirus.”\n\nState-run media accused the United States of denigrating China’s fight, while castigating the many genuine failures of U.S. planning and policy execution in the face of the crisis: “They have misused the time China bought for them by blaming China for so-called ‘delays’ during the initial stage of the outbreak. A full month after the beginning of the out-break in China, the US still has not yet equipped itself with sufficient and reliable testing kits, missing the opportunity to identify cases and curbing the spread of the virus. Large public events and rallies are still being held in the US, despite the risk of mass infection.... After accusing China of providing ‘imperfect’ data, the US is being far from transparent.”\n\nWhite House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien counterpunched, charging that China’s handling of the initial outbreak in Wuhan “probably cost the world community two months to respond and those two months, if we’d had those [and] been able to sequence the virus and had the cooperation necessary from the Chinese, had a WHO team been on the ground, had a CDC team, which we had offered, been on the ground, I think we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what’s now happening across the world.”\n\nSimilarly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo consistently refers to “the Wuhan virus,” enraging China. Pompeo also eagerly took up O’Brien’s line of attack, charging that the early cover-up efforts in Wuhan damaged the rest of the world’s ability to prepare, “putting the U.S. behind the curve.” The State Department summoned China’s ambassador to the United States, dressing him down for waging a “blatant” disinformation campaign. Pompeo went further, undermining negotiations over a G7 statement responding to Covid-19 by insisting all official communiques refer to the “Wuhan Virus”—and the president pointedly and repeatedly has called Covid-19 the “China Virus” or “Chinese Virus.”\n\nTrump campaign supporter Charlie Kirk, head of the Koch-funded right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, tweeted reference to the “China Virus,” adding that the United States could still contain its spread, “if we can control … our borders.” President Trump piled on that tweet, writing, “Going up fast. We need the Wall more than ever!”\n\nOne recent study claims 66 percent of the global burden of Covid-19 would have been eliminated if China had acted faster, closing down Wuhan weeks earlier. But the same study credits China’s eventual actions for preventing a catastrophic pandemic that would have been 67 times worse without them. Nevertheless, a host of conservative talk show pundits and politicians have taken to China-bashing, accusing Beijing of deliberately imperiling the world, and of deceiving the president, thus rationalizing America’s slow response to Covid-19. Both China and the United States have expelled journalists hailing from their rival nation, claiming the reporters spread falsehoods.\n\nPresident Trump seemed genuinely bewildered when Congress rejected his request for $2.5 billion in emergency funds to fight the epidemic, much of it stripped from prior moneys committed to Ebola preparedness. A bipartisan vote in both houses found the White House request woefully small, authorizing instead a bill funded for $8.3 billion. In remarks to Sean Hannity on Fox News, Trump also seemed to dismiss, yet again, the likely severity of the Covid-19 threat, calling it the “coronaflu.” He observed further that, much like seasonal influenza, the coronavirus would be something that made a few people very sick but for most was so mild that they could go to work, as usual.\n\nSeemingly unable to grasp how monumental the pandemic battle would be, Trump continued to address crowded rallies of supporters and shake hands on the campaign trail. He’s also socialized with Florida Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, who has since been quarantined for coronavirus exposure, and Fábio Wajngarten, communications chief for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who’s been diagnosed with Covid-19, apparently acquired during a visit to Mar-a-Lago, the president’s Florida retreat.\n\nNothing seemed capable of shaking Trump’s faith in border closures and travel bans—the core of his Covid-19 control campaign. But the CDC acknowledged that during the first three weeks of airport screening only one potential Covid-19 case was discovered out of 46,016 examined. And two graphics told the tale of America’s vulnerability by mid-March. The first tracks outbreaks all over the world, indicating that the United States was running in tandem with Italy, lagging about 10 days behind the overwhelmed nation.\n\nThe second damning comparative chart, produced by the Council on Foreign Relations, tracked the rise of cases in countries with, and without, travel bans, indicating the four fastest-growing epidemics were all in nations that made travel bans the key element of their coronavirus policies—one of them, the United States of America.\n\nSuch are the risks incurred by dangerously uninformed demagogues in the rounds of their daily political life. For the rest of us, the stakes of the coronavirus pandemic are much higher. In a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill in early March, congressional physician Brian Monahan told staffers that roughly a third of all Americans, perhaps up to 150 million, will be infected with the coronavirus this year.\n\nAs April approached, some in China’s leadership seemed eager to soften tensions, trying to disclaim prior allegations that Covid-19 was manufactured in a U.S. military laboratory. But real damage has been done to the Sino-American relationship, and it may not be easily reparable.\n\nIt is tragic and perverse that animosities between two egotistical leaders and their sycophantic circles of advisers have placed the entire world in grave peril. Trade disputes between Washington and Beijing were already producing widespread global fallout before the emergence of Covid-19.\n\nTrue, conventional diplomatic initiatives can control some of this damage—but it’s also the case that no reasonable dialogue between the United States and China can transpire unless both sides are willing to start the conversation based on valid science. Neither Beijing nor Washington seems remotely inclined to take on this humbling challenge to the actual legacies of their respective Covid-19 programs. President Donald Trump refuses to grasp scientific principles, on any topic, and openly contradicts his leading public health and scientific research advisers. For his part, President Xi Jinping remains determined to change the conversation regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2, removing all references to its linkage to Wuhan.\n\nGoing forward, there is one hope for humanity, and for the Sino-American relationship: the development of an effective coronavirus vaccine. Several nations, including China and the United States, are racing to create a vaccine, and to push prototypes of one into large clinical trials. With luck, one of those products can stop Covid-19’s spread, without difficult side effects.\n\nBut that may well lay the groundwork for additional high-stakes battles. In past global epidemics, such discoveries have led to two terrible outcomes: patent disputes, and a fully unjust distribution of lifesaving innovations worldwide. In 2009, for example, the H1N1 swine flu spread globally in less than six months, but viable vaccines weren’t available for most countries until the epidemic had passed. Poor countries never did receive supplies of the vaccine that were sufficient to put a dent in their outbreaks. Fortunately, the H1N1 virus was relatively benign, and the failure to distribute a global vaccine had no significant mortality outcome.\n\nPresident Trump refuses to grasp scientific principles, on any topic, and openly contradicts his leading public health and scientific research advisers.\n\nInternational agencies are now poised to counter such profit-motive failures in the vaccines markets, drawing their funding mostly from the Gates Foundation and the foreign aid budgets of a handful of wealthy countries. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which grew out of the World Economic Forum, offers financial support for vaccine invention. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, makes bulk purchases of childhood vaccines and helps ensure their distribution in poor countries. The Global Fund underwrites some health system costs for poor countries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Together, they represent a fledgling international infrastructure for global immunization.\n\nBut Covid-19 won’t simply disappear if the wealthy world is left to its own devices, manufacturing costly vaccines that are only affordable to fully insured residents of the 30 richest nations on Earth. What we collectively face is the need to execute the largest mass immunization program in world history, deploying teams of vaccinators to every nook and cranny of the planet, rich or poor.\n\nThe last time any such gargantuan feat was attempted was following a Soviet and American 1966 call for smallpox eradication, led by WHO. Thousands of vaccinating teams deployed all over the world, eventually in 1977 vanquishing the virus that killed more human beings in the twentieth century than all wars combined. As totemic as smallpox eradication is in the annals of global public health, it was accomplished at a time when three billion fewer people lived on the planet, and many of them lived in countries that conducted routine childhood immunization. This meant that the immunization initiative undertaken from 1966 to 1977 targeted about one billion people.\n\nIf an effective Covid-19 vaccine is developed, its targets will include almost eight billion human beings, with nearly three-quarters of a billion living in conditions of extreme poverty, according to World Bank figures. Eliminating the coronavirus scourge will require mobilization of tens of thousands of immunization teams, armed with affordably priced vaccines. It is likely that both China and the United States, based on their initial human tests of candidate vaccines, will lead global manufacturing—and that both countries will face the moral and economic pressures of balancing global needs against company profits.\n\nIn the best of all possible worlds, Presidents Xi and Trump can rise to this epochal challenge, and see their way clear to formalize an agreement to execute the largest humanitarian effort in world history to arrest the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And in that long-shot scenario, we might even see these two power-mad egomaniacs share a Nobel Peace Prize."

            "content": "HONG KONG, April 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The second batch of over 37,000 pieces of medical supplies donated by Shanghai Fosun Foundation (\"Fosun Foundation\"), together with Beijing Taikang Yicai Foundation, German private bank Hauck & Aufhäuser, and German fast fashion brand Tom Tailor was delivered to Frankfurt helping local medical organizations to fight against the epidemic.\n\nThis batch of over 37,000 pieces of medical supplies and 5,040 doses of novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection kits will be donated to Germany's Ministry of Health and Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund (\"ASB\"). Since Fosun has kicked off its second phase of Global Anti-Virus Relief Scheme, this is the thirteenth batch of medical supplies shipped overseas.\n\nIn view of this, Mr. Clemens von Goetze, German Ambassador to China representing Federal Government of Germany wrote a \"Letter of appreciation\" to particularly extend its gratitude to Fosun, for their kind donation of protective supplies at such a critical time. He said, \"Fosun is the first Chinese enterprise to contact German Embassy and offer a helping hand.\" \"We appreciate the empathy and kindness. It's glad to see the bonding between China and Germany still stays strong in crisis.\"\n\nGerman is currently facing a severe epidemic situation. According to the latest announcement of the Robert Koch Institute of German Disease Control Agency, as of 29 March, local time, a total of 60,357 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia had been confirmed, and 456 deaths had been reported in Germany.\n\nAs a core member of the emergency medical system in Germany, Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund (ASB) mainly provides protection and emergency rescue for citizens. ASB has been deeply involved in the anti-epidemic front line since the virus spread. Due to the shortage of medical protective supplies, paramedics of ASB have been working without protections for a while. They are deeply moved by Fosun's prompt response. One of ASB's paramedics named Vanessa Reiff and her colleagues looked up the dictionary for the Chinese wordings of, \"Thank you very much, China! Danke, Fosun!\", and print the wordings on a sheet to express their gratitude. She said, \" I'd love to visit China when the epidemic is over, to visit the Great Wall, to try the hot pot, and to get a better understanding of our Chinese friend.\"\n\nASB members received medical supplies donated by Fosun, holding \"Thank you very much\" sign in Chinese. More\n\nRecently, the first batch of 13,400 pieces of medical supplies donated by Fosun Foundation together with other benevolent enterprises to Germany has been delivered to the front line once it arrived in Hamburg. Currently, this batch of supplies consisting of 3,400 protective suits and 8,000 surgical masks, of which 2,000 are cleared for use in the red zones, has been donated to the Hospital Northwest Frankfurt, the University Hospital Frankfurt, and the Städtisches Krankenhaus Heinsberg GmbH Hospital and the Uniklinik Saarland Hospital which are located in the worst-affected areas.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the verses that represent friendship and blessings between two countries, \"Edel sei der Mensch, hilfreich und gut\" and \"Share the weal and woe together in the same boat\", was printed on the packaging box of medical supplies. The translation of the first sentence was \"Wish humans to learn, to help, and to be good\". It was written by the famous German writer Goethe born in Frankfurt. The latter sentence is from Book of The Later Han · Fu Zou Ji Liang Ji – \"As the leader among people, we share our difficulties like riding side by side, sailing the same boat.\" Fosun used this verse to show that the unity between Fosun and the local people, helping each other and fighting against the epidemic."

            "content": "China has gradually emerged out of its shadow of despair as the epicentre where the coronavirus pandemic started. Now, there is face saving required – as well as agenda-setting in the global power play.\n\nChina played a decisive role in combating the invisible enemy. Chinese officials and academics are taking this opportunity to rescript the narrative and place China as the new world leader.\n\nIn the quest for this leadership, China seems to be playing the game of “white face” (friendly face) and “red face” (hostile face). Similar to the Western concept of good cop/bad cop, white face and red face uses seemingly opposing actions to achieve a singular goal.\n\nThe red face is Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman who suggested the virus originated in the US and was brought to Wuhan by American soldiers.\n\nThe white face is providing medical supplies to countries now battling the pandemic, gestures of goodwill described as “mask diplomacy” or “medical diplomacy”.\n\nBy understanding the context for these donations, we can understand a lot about how China embeds symbolism within its soft power diplomacy.\n\nGuarding life\n\nChinese people have a long history of wearing masks as protection from disease, chemical warfare, pollution, and severe weather. As early as the 13th century, court servants would cover their noses and mouths with a silk cloth when bringing food to the emperor.\n\nAs China increasingly encountered foreign powers through Treaty Ports at the turn of the 20th century, disease control became a critical concern. Despite the long legacy of traditional medicine, China was seen as an unhygienic place by the Western occupiers of these ports.\n\nChina’s opening to the West in 1978 led to a greater awareness of hygiene. The Chinese word for hygiene weisheng (literally “guarding life”) was incorporated by health reformers in numerous applications, from wooden disposable chopsticks to toilet paper.\n\nIn China, not wearing masks in the current health crisis is seen as unhygienic, irresponsible, and even transgressive. Punitive measures are taken by authorities, with non-mask-wearers publicly shamed and humiliated on Chinese social media.\n\nIn the West, masks have been widely viewed with suspicion. The official advice from Australian health authorities is if you are not sick, don’t wear masks.\n\nThis has lead to anxiety and discontent among Chinese Australians, frustrated by what they see as bad advice. The general public attitude toward mask wearers compounds the problem as Chinese Australians are unfairly targeted with racist slurs.\n\nRead more: Do homemade masks work? Sometimes. But leave the design to the experts\n\nInternational diplomacy\n\nAt the height of the Wuhan outbreak, government, private companies and individual citizens in Japan donated thousands of masks. But more significant than the masks was the symbolism. Emblazoned on cargo boxes from the Japan Youth Development Association were Chinese characters reading “Lands apart, sky shared”, a line from an ancient Chinese poem.\n\nA month later, the Jack Ma Foundation reciprocated with a large donation of masks to Japan, with a quote from the same poem: “Stretching before you and me are the same mountain ranges; let’s face the same wind and rain together.”\n\nMillions of masks and thousands of testing kits are being sent overseas, coordinated and endorsed by Chinese government organisations and taking place at the government-to-government level; by the private sector through companies and charity foundations; and by individuals helping their overseas friends.\n\nMeraj Alam/EPA\n\nMask diplomacy is part of China’s new dual level power play: aiding to foreign countries to regain face and demonstrate its role as a responsible global power; and sharing conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus to attack the opponent.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories – here's why that's a serious problem\n\nChina is being aided in this messaging by inefficiency of the US in handling the crisis. By finger pointing at the US, some say China is hoping to “distract from domestic government incompetence.”\n\nThis effort to rewrite the virus narrative through mask diplomacy is a strategic gambit to claim the moral high ground and assert international power.\n\nChanging faces\n\nPerhaps a clue to what is now unfolding comes from the world of theatre.\n\nIn Chinese Sichuan opera, the performer magically changes masks. A skilled performer can accomplish ten mask changes in 20 seconds. This is one of the great accomplishments of Chinese culture, part of its soft power arsenal. The term used in Chinese, bianlian (literally “changing face”), however, is also a synonym for suddenly turning hostile.\n\nChina may have dodged a bullet. But if the pandemic spirals further out of control, China will have a lot more work to do to deliver its charm offensive.\n\nThe next few months will be crucial. Much of the global leadership in this global warfare will depend on the US, with its own president appearing to change face at any moment.\n\nPower in the age of global contagion requires more than the dual faces of white and red. The world needs healing, and so the Chinese government will need to carefully moderate its propaganda. Triumphalism over the success of its own military-style control strategies and finger pointing at others may evoke blowback in the theatre of geopolitics."

            "content": "Like many other websites at the moment, the career-oriented networking platform LinkedIn has seen a big boost in traffic as a result of people being asked to work from home and stay indoors overall to slow the spread of the coronavirus, with a bump of 55% more conversational activity between existing connections in recent weeks. Now, to leverage that attention in a way that’s more directly helpful during this health crisis, LinkedIn is introducing new measures specifically around job listings.\n\nFrom today and for the next three months, LinkedIn says it will provide free job postings for “essential” businesses globally — companies in healthcare, as well as warehousing, supermarket, freight delivery and nonprofits working in support or relief roles — in other words, those providing critical front-line services to keep the economy and society in motion. Healthcare will include companies working in areas like medical devices, medical practice (including hospitals) and mental health care.\n\nAlongside this, LinkedIn is creating an “urgent jobs” board to give these openings more priority visibility. People whose skills match up with those needed for these jobs who visit LinkedIn’s jobs homepage will see the special listings highlighted. Those who sign up for job alerts with matching skills will in turn get real-time alerts of the jobs as they get posted.\n\nThe volunteer ads also link up with an expanded Recruiting for Good program to help bring in more people to work with nonprofits in both volunteer and paid roles. And those doing the recruiting will also get three months of free access to LinkedIn’s talent insights tools to figure out where their (free) ads are best placed around hiring trends and more.\n\nOrganizations that have already signed up to use these include the American Red Cross of Los Angeles, the CommonSpirit Health hospital network, Doctors on Demand and New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nThe new initiatives underscore the bigger trend of how tech companies are looking to provide whatever assistance they can bring to the table in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n(Others include Google, which is trying to help with testing, while also providing a landing page for official and local information, while both Facebook and Twitter are trying to stamp out fake news while surfacing links to official organizations for help.)\n\nRecruitment — which has traditionally been LinkedIn’s biggest revenue generator (as part of Microsoft, it does not regularly report financials on its business lines) — has been in an interesting position within that.\n\nOn the one hand, recruitment and its counterpart, employment, have been two of the essential levers in fighting this pandemic.\n\nOn the clinical front, hospitals and related care organizations are scrambling to keep up with the surge in demand for their services, leading to major recruitment drives to bring in people with relevant experience, in some cases going straight to the ranks of those who may have left the profession and now are being asked to step in again.\n\nIn the U.K., for example, some 4,500 doctors and nurses have so far answered an open call to come back into medical service (many will have moved on to other non-clinical or managerial roles in the NHS, or left the public sector, or the profession altogether, not just retired due to age), with more likely to come. And that’s just on the clinical front. We’re seeing a multitude of call outs across other sectors, like technology, to bring in experts in AI and other areas to help design software and hardware to slow the spread of the virus, to alleviate some of the side effects, to identify it faster and maybe even to potentially cure it.\n\nIn another vein, the closures of restaurants and public places has put a big shift on to supermarkets and other food providers to beef up their work forces to meet their rising demands. That’s meant that while many people have lost their old jobs due to closures, they are getting opportunities to redeploy elsewhere.\n\n(The same goes for the collective groundswell of people who have emerged as volunteers to help others who are in need, with hundreds of thousands volunteering to help deliver medications or other essential tasks to supplement the work of front-line healthcare providers.)\n\nOn another level, beyond addressing the pandemic in a direct way, employment and recruitment have become something of a canary in the coal mine when it comes to assessing how different sectors and the economy overall is faring, and how it will look when the pandemic starts to subside.\n\nWe’ve charted some notable developments of hiring freezes, layoffs and furloughs in the tech world already — as well as hiring boosts for those suddenly finding their businesses in huge demand — and the same thing is playing out across other sectors, a trend LinkedIn, as one of the bigger recruitment portals in the world, is well-positioned to see.\n\n“The trend as the virus moves through the world has been a decline in job posts,” said Blake Barnes, LinkedIn’s head of careers and talent solutions. “It’s a pattern we saw starting in China with the first wave of the pandemic.” Positively, he noted that “we have also seen that recovery brings growth as well.”\n\nFor now, LinkedIn has set some criteria in place to tailor eligibility. For example, nonprofit organizations that want to be a part of the Recruiting for Good program need to be U.S. 501c3 registered (or the global equivalent), providing disaster response or services for COVID-19 relief​. Hospitals that want to be a part of the Recruiting for Good program (but not for the general critical recruitment drive) need to be in critical areas of coronavirus outbreak (based on impact data) and understaffed and in need of urgent clinical front-line workers for COVID-19 response.\n\nOver time, there will likely be more types of businesses added to the mix of “essential” companies (for example, as a car parts company retools to become a ventilator maker) and nonprofits over time, and also more evolutions in how job ads get seen by people. The main point was to deploy quickly to start work as soon as possible.\n\n“We are keeping a close eye on the situation, but we have already seen a critical talent shortage,” said Barnes. “We’re starting with the obvious companies, but we’re getting these tools to market where they are most needed. But things change every single day, so we’ll be assessing in real time to understand how different sectors are evolving and changing.”"
