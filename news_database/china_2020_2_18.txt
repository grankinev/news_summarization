It will be guarded to ensure that only residents can enter or leave.\n\nAll other businesses will stay closed, except chemists, hotels, food shops and medical services.\n\nVehicles used for the delivery of essential goods are exempt from the car ban.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Medics in Wuhan resort to shaving their heads in a bid to prevent cross-infection of the coronavirus\n\nMeanwhile, authorities in the capital, Beijing, have ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment.\n\nChina's central bank will also disinfect and store used banknotes before recirculating them in a bid to stop the virus spreading.\n\nWhat is the latest on cases?\n\nOn Sunday, authorities reported 2,009 new cases - down from 2,641 on Saturday, and 5,090 the day before.\n\nNew cases spiked earlier in the week after a change in the way they were counted but have been falling ever since. In total, more than 68,500 people have so far been infected in China.\n\nNational Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the figures showed China was managing to curb the outbreak.\n\n\"The effects of epidemic prevention and control in various parts of the country can already be seen.\"\n\nThe commission's daily bulletin also reported 142 more deaths nationwide, the vast majority in Hubei.\n\nHowever Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that along with a drop in infections within Hubei there had been a rapid increase in the number of people who had recovered.\n\nThe proportion of infected patients considered to be in a \"serious condition\" has dropped nationwide from more than 15% to just over 7%, according to China's State Council.\n\nTaiwan has now reported a death from the illness - a taxi driver, 61, who had not travelled abroad recently but had diabetes and hepatitis B, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said.\n\nThe minister said many of his passengers had come from China.\n\nOutside China, there have been more than 500 cases in nearly 30 countries. Four others have died outside China - in France, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.\n\nWhere else has been affected by coronavirus?\n\nThe Diamond Princess contains the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside China.\n\nThe Americans are being taken off the vessel and most are expected to be flown to the US on two government-chartered planes.\n\nBut the 40 who are infected will be taken to Japanese hospitals, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told Face the Nation on CBS.\n\nThe Diamond Princess has been quarantined in Japan's port of Yokohama since 3 February after a man left the ship in Hong Kong and was found to have the virus.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption There are around 3,400 on board the Diamond Princess\n\nThe Japanese authorities say the number of new cases of coronavirus on board the ship has risen by 70 to 355.\n\nOther evacuation flights will repatriate residents of Israel, Hong Kong and Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, a plane carrying 175 evacuated Nepalis, mostly students, has arrived in Kathmandu from Wuhan. It is the latest country to fly its citizens out of Hubei province.\n\nPresident Xi's speech\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese state media published a speech from earlier this month in which Chinese President Xi Jinping said he said he had given instructions on 7 January on containing the outbreak.\n\nAt the time, local officials in the city of Wuhan were downplaying the severity of the epidemic.\n\nThis would suggest senior leaders were aware of the potential dangers of the virus before the information was made public.\n\nWith the government facing criticism for its handling of the outbreak, analysts suggest the disclosure is an attempt to show the party leadership acted decisively from the start.\n\nRead more about the coronavirus and its impact"

            "content": "Many cities in China are still in quarantine lockdown in efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, pushing most activities online. Day-to-day activities like grocery orders and university classes are affected, but so is live entertainment. Music venues are shuttered across the country, rendering the country’s live music scene “temporarily dead and silent.” With everyone bored and stuck at home, a report by Hyperallergic (that builds off previous pieces by RADII and CDM) reveals how China’s musicians have turned to live-streaming to perform at virtual festivals and club nights.\n\nThe report says bands and DJs alike are transforming their homes into performance spaces, with clubs, record labels, and event promoters all hopping on board. Options range from techno to rock to pop, with most of the action happening on BiliBili, a Chinese video sharing website. The site features bullet chatting, a function that superimposes user comments on screen in a way that makes people feel more present. “It’s like going to a karaoke parlor or being in a mosh pit without leaving your house,” one singer told Hyperallergic.\n\nProminent indie record labels like Ruby Eyes and Modern Sky are streaming “showcases” for artists on their roster, and venues like Shanghai’s Yuyintang are even considering ticketed online performances. Many of these are hosted on the live-streaming site BiliBili, which contains a crucial social feature, Bullet Comments or 弹幕 (“danmu”), that make these events an active expression of community and social bonding, rather than just passive experiences. Bullet Comments are a mix of discussion forum threads, live chat, and participatory art that conjure a powerful online approximation of real-life conviviality, and a raucous vibe akin to a successful party. Comments made on a video fly across the video screen like heckles or encouragement from a virtual audience.\n\nElsewhere, other bits of how the concert industry has been affected in China have been brought to light. BiliBili itself has gotten into the mix, partnering with a promoter to produce a stay at home concert series, as reported by Variety. Billboard estimates that about 20,000 concerts slated to happen between January and March have been cancelled or postponed.\n\nHyperallergic’s piece gives a more intimate glimpse into how China’s musicians and fans are not just keeping the scene afloat, but creating community in a time of imposed isolation. A photo of a punk band live-streaming in masks and a hazmat suit to people’s amusement perhaps best sums things up. There’s necessity in making the best of a bad situation.\n\nGo read Hyperallergic’s piece for more details along with flyers, sets, and links to watch live-streamed shows for yourself."

But heading into 2020, China’s venture capital world was already in steep decline. This morning we’re exploring the country’s Q4 2019 venture capital results and pulling in fresh data from 2020 to get a handle on what’s happening in China today.\n\nSome years ago, China’s venture capital scene was a clear global leader, busy vying for the top spot in global venture capital activity. So great was China’s rise in the venture world you could find investors and founders alike extolling working culture in China as superior to that of the United States, paeans to the scale that China’s population offered technology startups and some concerns that China’s venture market could surpass the United State’s own, creating a new center of gravity in the world of technology.\n\nViews on China have since changed. Let’s figure out how much."

Green means the user can travel freely; yellow prompts instructions for the user to remain quarantined for seven days; and red — used in the most severe cases— carries a 14-day quarantine period and instructs users to regularly check-in via an Alibaba chat app.\n\nLast week, the feature rolled out to residents of Hangzhou in eastern China as part of a test run, and as of Sunday Alipay has begun working with federal authorities to begin implementing it nationwide. Per Reuters, state media aims to deploy this system at both travel checkpoints and within individual neighborhoods in order to track anyone who might be at risk of spreading the disease. Two Hangzhou residents told the outlet they were asked to scan their QR codes before entering their apartment complexes, and a third was asked to show her code before being allowed into a local supermarket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTencent announced a similar feature Saturday as part of a partnership with China’s National Development and Reform Council. The system has been deployed in the southern city of Shenzhen and will soon branch out to the great Guangdong province, the company said in a social media post.\n\nThese state-sponsored corporate tracking programs join several other unsettlingly futuristic ways Chinese authorities have been using technology to monitor and combat the outbreak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier reports confirmed that police, in an effort to keep officers away from the public, have employed a QR-code system distributed via aerial drones to collect residents’ health information. Authorities have also enlisted land-based robots to help prevent human-to-human transmission of the virus. Authorities in the Yunnan province have also purportedly deployed a system similar to Alipay’s; residents claim they’re required to scan an assigned QR code before being allowed into buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, COVID-19 is responsible for more than 1,700 deaths. The majority occurred in mainland China, where more than 100 million residents remain on a virtual lockdown with no foreseeable end. Around 70,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide in more than two dozen countries, per WHO statistics.\n\n\n\n[Reuters]"

            "content": "BEIJING -- Health officials in China have published the first details on nearly 45,000 cases of the novel coronavirus disease that originated there, saying more than 80% have been mild and new ones seem to be falling since early this month, although it's far too soon to tell whether the outbreak has peaked.\n\nMonday's report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention gives the World Health Organization a \"clearer picture of the outbreak, how it's developing and where it's headed,\" WHO's director-general said at a news conference.\n\n\"It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\n\nThe new disease, called COVID-19, first emerged in late December in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has spread to more than two dozen other countries. China says more than 70,000 people have been infected and 1,770 have died in mainland China, but numbers are squishy because the country is counting many cases based on symptoms rather than the methods WHO uses.\n\nThe new study reports on 44,672 cases confirmed in China as of Feb. 11. The virus caused severe disease such as pneumonia in 14% of them and critical illness in 5%.\n\nThe fatality rate for these confirmed cases is 2.3% -- 2.8% for males versus 1.7% for females.\n\nThat's lower than for SARS and MERS, two similar viruses, but COVID-19 ultimately could prove more deadly if it spreads to far more people than the others did. Ordinary flu has a fatality rate of 0.1% yet kills hundreds of thousands because it infects millions each year.\n\nThe COVID-19 cases include relatively few children, and the risk of death rises with age. It's higher among those with other health problems -- more than 10% for those with heart disease, for example, and higher among those in Hubei province versus elsewhere in China.\n\nCases seem to have been declining since Feb. 1, but that could change as people return to work and school after the Chinese holidays, the report warns.\n\nAlso Monday, Chinese officials said they may postpone the country's annual congress in March, its biggest political meeting of the year. The standing committee for the National People's Congress said it believes it is necessary to postpone the gathering to give top priority to people's lives, safety and health, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nThe standing committee said it would meet Feb. 24 to deliberate on a postponement. The meeting is due to start March 5.\n\nJapanese officials, meanwhile, confirmed 99 more people were infected by the new virus aboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 454. The Health Ministry said it has now tested 1,723 people on the ship, which had about 3,700 passengers and crew aboard. Outside China, the ship has the largest number of cases of COVID-19.\n\nOn Sunday night and Monday, 328 American cruise ship passengers arrived in the U.S., including 14 who tested positive for the virus and were taken to hospitals in California and Nebraska. Others were being quarantined at military bases in California and Texas.\n\nA charter plane dropped off 170 passengers at Travis Air Force Base in the San Francisco Bay Area late Sunday, while another took about 145 passengers to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas early Monday.\n\nFour of the Americans who tested positive for the virus were taken to California hospitals. Ten others, along with three spouses, were flown to Omaha, Nebraska, to get care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, officials said.\n\nChris Kratochvil, an official at the Nebraska medical centre, said 12 are in quarantine with no current symptoms. One man is in a different area getting a higher level of care because he had a cough and other symptoms plus a chronic illness that raises his risk for complications. All will remain at the university hospital for at least 14 days.\n\nDuring the flights, the 14 cruise passengers who tested positive for the virus were placed in isolation in the tail of the planes, said William Walters, director of the State Department's operational medicine staff, a unit created to respond to emergencies such as those requiring large-scale evacuations.\n\nWalters said none of the 14 showed symptoms when they were checked by American personnel before disembarking the cruise ship. While headed to Tokyo's Haneda airport, officials were informed a test for the coronavirus done by Japanese authorities two or three days earlier had come back positive.\n\n\"When we received the results, these people were already on a bus and they were already on a pipeline,\" Walters said Monday. \"The next step was to move them to an isolation area and frankly once they were in an isolation area it was safest to keep them in that isolation area and complete the evacuation.\"\n\nCentres for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Scott Pauley said in a statement that the group of passengers who arrived at Lackland Air Force Base will remain quarantined there for 14 days and will have no contact with Department of Defence personnel as the CDC is responsible for all parts of the quarantine operation.\n\nAny of the quarantined passengers who shows symptoms of the virus will be taken to a hospital off the base \"for containment and specialized care,\" according to the statement.\n\nIn Asia, with fears of the virus spreading further, Chinese and residents of nearby countries and territories have begun hoarding supplies of everything from masks and other personal protective gear to instant noodles, cooking oil and toilet paper.\n\nNew cases in other countries, meanwhile, raised concerns about containment of the virus. Though only a few hundred cases have been confirmed outside mainland China, some recent cases lacked obvious connections to China.\n\nTaiwan on Sunday reported its first death from COVID-19, the fifth fatality outside of mainland China. Taiwan's Central News Agency, citing health minister Chen Shih-chung, said the man who died was in his 60s and had not travelled overseas recently and had no known contact with virus patients.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an experts meeting to discuss containment measures in his country, where more than a dozen cases have emerged in the past few days without any obvious link to China.\n\n\"The situation surrounding this virus is changing by the minute,\" Abe said.\n\nJapanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the country was \"entering into a phase that is different from before,\" requiring new steps to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nJapan has 518 confirmed cases, including the 454 from the cruise ship, and one death from the virus.\n\n------\n\nAssociated Press writers Yanan Wang in Beijing, David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa, Maria Cheng in London, Olga R.

Another 10,844 people have recovered from COVID-19, a disease caused by the new coronavirus, and have been discharged from hospitals, according to Monday’s figures.\n\nThe update followed the publication late Saturday in China’s official media of a recent speech by President Xi Jinping in which he indicated for the first time that he had led the response to the outbreak from early in the crisis. While the reports were an apparent attempt to demonstrate the Communist Party leadership acted decisively from the start, it also opened Xi up to criticism over why the public was not alerted sooner.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn his speech, Xi said he gave instructions on fighting the virus on Jan. 7 and ordered the shutdown of the most-affected cities that began on Jan. 23.\n\nThe disclosure of his speech indicates top leaders knew about the outbreak’s potential severity at least two weeks before such dangers were made known to the public.

The U.S. Embassy said the departure was offered because people on the ship were at a high risk of exposure to the virus. People with symptoms were banned from the flights.\n\nAbout 255 Canadians and 330 Hong Kong residents are on board the ship or undergoing treatment in Japanese hospitals.

Photo : Getty Images\n\nLiu Zhiming, the 51-year-old director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, China, died at 10:54 AM local time Tuesday morning after being infected with coronavirus, according to the Wuhan Health Commission. Multiple Chinese state media outlets like the People’s Daily and Global Times reported Liu’s death yesterday but created confusion after deleting those reports Monday night. One health official in Wuhan insisted on social media that Liu was actually still alive.\n\n\n\nAt least 1,716 health care workers have been infected with the coronavirus, which causes an illness called COVID-19. The virus has killed 1,873 people and infected at least 73,325 worldwide, with about 1,900 new cases announced today. At least 7 health professionals have now died in China, including Liu, who is the first hospital director to succumb to the illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChinese state media reported that Liu had died on Monday, before a Wuhan health official took to the Chinese social media site Weibo late Monday to say the hospital director was “still being resuscitated.” News outlets in China quickly deleted their stories and tweets, suggesting he may still be alive. But state-run outlet CCTV confirmed that Liu died Tuesday morning after an announcement from the Wuhan Health Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiu’s medical facility is one of seven hospitals in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, that have been designated to treat patients with COVID-19. Wuhan, which is in Hubei province, is still where the vast majority of confirmed cases of coronavirus are being treated, and a new analysis suggests the virus is roughly 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu.\n\nThe confusion surrounding Liu’s death is similar to early reports from China about Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor and whistleblower in Wuhan who died on February 7. Li’s death was reported on Chinese social media and led to both mourning and public outrage over his treatment by Chinese authorities. Li had been accused of spreading unfounded rumors and panic when the coronavirus first emerged in December 2019 but has become a national hero in China for his bravery. Shortly after news of Li’s death, other reports from Chinese state media emerged that he was still alive. Ultimately, Li was declared dead again from coronavirus-related pneumonia, according to state media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoughly 150 million people are currently on strict lockdown in China in an effort by health authorities to control the spread of the virus, and an estimated 760 million are under some form of rules that restrict their movement, according to the New York Times. Outside of China, there’s cautious optimism that the virus can be contained. But there are also plenty of signs that the coronavirus has the potential to spread far and wide.\n\nJapan’s Health Ministry today reported 88 more cases of COVID-19 on the the Diamond Princess cruise ship, currently docked in Yokohama, Japan, bringing the total of infected from the ship to 542. Of the 88 new cases, 65 had no symptoms, a worrying sign for those who wish to stop the disease from becoming a global pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen (left) meets passengers who disembarked from the Westerdam cruise ship in Sihanoukville on February 14, 2020.

The ship was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia where the Prime Minister, former Khmer Rouge soldier Hun Sen, greeted people as they disembarked on February 14 . But now an American who was on the ship has tested positive for the virus in Malaysia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll 1,455 passengers from the Westerdam are now heading home to 41 different countries, including the United States. Holland America Line, owned by Carnival Cruise Corp, provided this breakdown of the nationalities to Gizmodo via email:\n\nUS, 650\n\nCanadian, 271\n\nUK, 127\n\nNetherlands, 91\n\nAustralian, 79\n\nGermany, 57\n\nHong Kong, 29\n\nOther, 151\n\nThe cruise line declined to break out the nationalities of the 151 other passengers. But if the Diamond Princess is any guide, it’s entirely possible that some of the 1,455 passengers from the Westerdam have contracted the coronavirus but don’t even know it. Only time will tell."

Aside from the risk of exposure for the crews, the operational and business concern is that when they return from mainland China they will essentially be unable to work for two weeks as they will have to go into quarantine immediately.''\n\nSingapore-based MyJet Asia said it has seen an increase of 80%-90% in the last month. \"A lot of people went away for Chinese New Year and are now struggling to get back to China,\" said Logan Ravishkansar, chief executive of MyJet Asia. Many have asked to be flown back to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage appearing to show people held in quarantine in a makeshift facility in Wuhan, has been shared across social media\n\n\"But we are massively restricted on where we can fly to, while the airlines are not letting us charter their planes despite the money,\" he added.\n\nOther travellers are desperate to get out of China. A government client from South America asked PrivateFly, a global booking service for charter flights, ''to set up four flights out of Wuhan for hundreds of passengers,'' according to its chief executive Adam Twidell.\n\nThe UK-based firm said it has had plenty of other inquiries from private individuals and groups.\n\nA ''very light jet'' can take between two and four passengers, and costs up to $2,400 (£1,850) per hour according to Paramount Business Jets. A \"super midsize\" jet can seat between eight and 10 people and costs $6,000 an hour.\n\nGlobal private jet firm VistaJet said it has seen double digit growth in inquiries over the past month even though it has stopped operations to and from China.\n\n\"While a large portion of the increase can be related to Chinese New Year travel, we also attribute the growth to customers preferring a private flight rather than a commercial option during a delicate time affected by the coronavirus outbreak,\" said Ian Moore, chief commercial officer of VistaJet.\n\nMr Ravishkansar said it was much more straightforward to charter planes during the SARS outbreak of 2003: \"We also saw huge demand back then but it was a lot easier to fly in and out of countries. This time around, governments have put on more controls.\""

It will be guarded to ensure that only residents can enter or leave.\n\nAll other businesses will stay closed, except chemists, hotels, food shops and medical services.\n\nVehicles used for the delivery of essential goods are exempt from the car ban.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Medics in Wuhan resort to shaving their heads in a bid to prevent cross-infection of the coronavirus\n\nMeanwhile, authorities in the capital, Beijing, have ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment.\n\nChina's central bank will also disinfect and store used banknotes before recirculating them in a bid to stop the virus spreading.\n\nWhat is the latest on cases?\n\nOn Sunday, authorities reported 2,009 new cases - down from 2,641 on Saturday, and 5,090 the day before.\n\nNew cases spiked earlier in the week after a change in the way they were counted but have been falling ever since. In total, more than 68,500 people have so far been infected in China.\n\nNational Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the figures showed China was managing to curb the outbreak.\n\n\"The effects of epidemic prevention and control in various parts of the country can already be seen.\"\n\nThe commission's daily bulletin also reported 142 more deaths nationwide, the vast majority in Hubei.\n\nHowever Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that along with a drop in infections within Hubei there had been a rapid increase in the number of people who had recovered.\n\nThe proportion of infected patients considered to be in a \"serious condition\" has dropped nationwide from more than 15% to just over 7%, according to China's State Council.\n\nTaiwan has now reported a death from the illness - a taxi driver, 61, who had not travelled abroad recently but had diabetes and hepatitis B, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said.\n\nThe minister said many of his passengers had come from China.\n\nOutside China, there have been more than 500 cases in nearly 30 countries. Four others have died outside China - in France, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.\n\nWhere else has been affected by coronavirus?\n\nThe Diamond Princess contains the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside China.\n\nThe Americans are being taken off the vessel and most are expected to be flown to the US on two government-chartered planes.\n\nBut the 40 who are infected will be taken to Japanese hospitals, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told Face the Nation on CBS.\n\nThe Diamond Princess has been quarantined in Japan's port of Yokohama since 3 February after a man left the ship in Hong Kong and was found to have the virus.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption There are around 3,400 on board the Diamond Princess\n\nThe Japanese authorities say the number of new cases of coronavirus on board the ship has risen by 70 to 355.\n\nOther evacuation flights will repatriate residents of Israel, Hong Kong and Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, a plane carrying 175 evacuated Nepalis, mostly students, has arrived in Kathmandu from Wuhan. It is the latest country to fly its citizens out of Hubei province.\n\nPresident Xi's speech\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese state media published a speech from earlier this month in which Chinese President Xi Jinping said he said he had given instructions on 7 January on containing the outbreak.\n\nAt the time, local officials in the city of Wuhan were downplaying the severity of the epidemic.\n\nThis would suggest senior leaders were aware of the potential dangers of the virus before the information was made public.\n\nWith the government facing criticism for its handling of the outbreak, analysts suggest the disclosure is an attempt to show the party leadership acted decisively from the start.\n\nRead more about the coronavirus and its impact"

REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nAuthorities throughout China have implemented various curbs on travel and movement in order to contain the epidemic, which has killed nearly 1,900 and infected more than 70,000 in the mainland alone. Such steps in turn have hampered the ability of companies to resume production, receive raw materials or send products to clients, disrupting their operations.\n\n“(The outbreak) in turn had a comparatively controllable impact in January operations and a major impact in February,” Ren Hongbin of China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), told reporters during a press briefing, adding that consumer-oriented firms and firms at the end of industrial chains have been hit the hardest.\n\nMore than 95% of central government-controlled companies in key sectors such as oil, communication, power and transport are in operation, Ren said.\n\nCapital Economics said in a report that it is now all but certain that China’s economy will contract in quarter-on-quarter terms in the first quarter. “We have penciled in a fall in output of 2.5% q/q,” Neil Shearing, group chief economist, wrote.\n\nPeng Huagang, a SASAC spokesman, said during the briefing the regulator will encourage centrally held firms to extend or revise contracts with small- to medium-sized companies that are struggling to deliver goods or make payments due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe regulator will also instruct state-owned firms to step up health monitoring of employees to be sent abroad for various overseas projects in order to prevent further spread of the coronavirus, Peng said.\n\nThe outbreak has had an impact on offshore projects and the state-owned firms will communicate with governments of relevant countries to ensure proper understanding of the situation, Peng added.\n\nShearing of Capital Economics said the virus had hit global supply chains and could have longer-term repercussions.\n\n“One plausible consequence is that it could accelerate the process of deglobalization that is already spreading through the world economy and which we have previously warned about.”"

All the previous deaths outside mainland China due to COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, were in Asia: one each in Japan, the Philippines and Hong Kong.\n\nRead more: Why We Are So Ill-Prepared for a Possible Pandemic Like Coronavirus\n\nThe Health Ministry announced Saturday night that France’s latest case is a British person who, like five other infected Britons, had stayed in an Alpine chalet with a businessman from England who had attended a conference in Singapore.

Buzyn said he arrived in France on Jan. 16 and was hospitalized on Jan. 25 under strict isolation measures but his condition deteriorated rapidly.\n\nOther French medical officials had said previously that the patient arrived in France on Jan. 23 and quickly fell ill.\n\nDr. Yazdan Yazdanpanah, head of Bichat’s infectious diseases unit, said the man visited two French hospitals. Because he “didn’t fulfill the definition” of someone considered at risk of infection with the virus, the hospitals decided it was unnecessary to test him, Yazdanpanah said.\n\nThe man did not live in Wuhan, the Chinese city that was the epicenter of the outbreak, but was from Hubei province, which includes Wuhan. He later tested positive and was put in isolation at Bichat Hospital on Jan. 28, Yazdanpanah said.\n\nThe man’s daughter also tested positive for the virus and admitted to Bichat Hospital for treatment, but is doing well and should be able to leave soon, the French health minister said.\n\nAs of Saturday, four of France’s 12 confirmed virus cases were in people since declared “cured” and released from the hospital, including a French doctor who was allowed to go home Friday, Buzyn said. A total of seven others remained hospitalized.\n\nBuzyn said she had no news about a French person who was among the 285 people from a cruise ship near Tokyo who tested positive for the virus and was hospitalized in Japan. Three other French citizens are on the ship, which is in quarantine in Yokohama.\n\nGermany’s dpa news agency reported Saturday that two infected passengers on the quarantined Diamond Princess are German citizens, according to the German Embassy in Tokyo.\n\nGet The Brief.

The World Health Organization has called the virus a threat to global health.\n\nChinese authorities have placed some 60 million people under a strict lockdown, built emergency hospitals and instituted controls across the country to fight the spread of the virus. Restaurants, cinemas and other businesses have been closed nationwide and sports and cultural events have been canceled to prevent crowds from gathering.\n\nIn Munich on Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a gathering of the world’s top defense officials and diplomats that his country was “determined to fight and win this battle” against the virus, and suggested that its efforts were paying off.\n\n“Dawn is breaking and we are seeing light coming through,” Wang said through a translator. He said the epidemic has presented a “severe challenge” to China’s economy growth but said it was well positioned to rebound.\n\nRead more: The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping’s Dreams of a Chinese Century\n\n“The fundamentals sustaining strong economic growth have not changed, and will not change,” he said. “After the storm comes the rainbow, and we are confident that China will emerge stronger from the epidemic.”\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said all Italians who sought repatriation from Wuhan due to the coronavirus have returned to Italy.

            "content": "Apple doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus in China.\n\nThe company said that the iPhone, which generates the bulk of Apple’s revenue, is temporarily constrained due to production ramping up more slowly than anticipated. “Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,” the company said in a statement Monday. In addition, demand for iPhones has been reduced because stores in China have been closed or operating with reduced hours and few customers, the company said.\n\nApple had forecast revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion for the fiscal second quarter ending in March. Analysts on average estimated $65.23 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company said in January when it announced its guidance that it anticipated factories reopening beginning Feb. 10. That process however has been slow as factory workers and manufacturing partners look to contain the virus, which has resulted in about 1,800 reported deaths in China, from spreading further.\n\n“This is the double-edged sword of being in China,” said longtime Apple analyst and Loup Ventures co-founder Gene Munster. “They’re the only big company with China exposure, so they are working through the pain of what has largely been a success for the company over the past decade.” Apple is the only major U.S. technology giant to offer the majority of its products and services in China. Products from Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. are either limited or unavailable.\n\nStill, Apple isn’t the only big tech company impacted by the virus. Nintendo is likely to struggle with production of its Switch gaming device due to coronavirus, while Facebook previously said that it will see production of its Oculus VR headsets drop due to the epidemic.\n\nApple said that, outside of China, products and services sales have been “strong to date and in line with our expectations.”\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based technology giant didn’t say what its new revenue outlook is for March but that situation is “evolving.” The company said it will share more information during its April earnings call. The disclosure marks the second time in two years that Apple has readjusted its earnings forecast due to China-related factors. For fiscal 2019, it cut holiday earnings projections on slower than expected iPhone sales in China, which it attributed in part to the trade war with the U.S.\n\nApple had been planning to start producing a new low-cost iPhone in February, putting it up for sale as early as March, Bloomberg News has reported. It’s unclear how coronavirus has impacted those plans.\n\n“This unexpected news confirms the worst fears of the Street that the virus outbreak has dramatically impacted iPhone supply from China/Foxconn with a demand ripple impact worldwide,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a research note. He kept an outperform rating on the stock and remains bullish on the longer-term outlook.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In addition to iPhone constraints, the company cited its inability to sell products at its retail and partner stores in China due to the virus. China represents Apple’s third-biggest market in terms of revenue and has 42 stores, which have been closed for much of February.\n\n“Stores that are open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic,” Apple said in its statement. “We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can.” Apple said its contact centers and corporate offices in China have already reopened. It has opened a few stores in China, including in Beijing and Shanghai, but with limited operating hours.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com."

These systems would require human oversight and audits, according to a widely leaked draft of the new rules.\n\nIn a press briefing in advance of Wednesday’s announcement, Vestager noted that companies outside the EU that want to deploy their tech in Europe might need to take steps like retraining facial recognition features using European data sets. The rules will cover such use cases as autonomous vehicles and biometric IDs.\n\nBut the proposal features carrots as well as sticks. The EU will propose spending almost $22 billion annually to build new data ecosystems that can serve as the basis for AI development. The plan assumes Europe has a wealth of government and industrial data, and it wants to provide regulatory and financial incentives to pool that data, which would then be available to AI developers who agree to abide by EU regulations.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters over the weekend, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for Internal Market and Services, said the EU wants to amass data gathered in such sectors as manufacturing, transportation, energy, and health care that can be leveraged to develop AI for the public good and to accelerate Europe’s own startups.\n\n“Europe is the world’s top industrial continent,” Breton told Reuters. “The United States [has] lost much of [its] industrial know-how in the last phase of globalisation. They have to gradually rebuild it. China has added-value handicaps it is correcting.”\n\nOf course, these rules are spooking Silicon Valley companies. Regulations such as GDPR, even if they officially target Europe, tend to have global implications.\n\nTo that end, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited Brussels today to meet with Vestager and discuss the proposed regulations. In a weekend opinion piece published by the Financial Times, however, Zuckerberg again called for greater regulation of AI and other technologies as a way to help build public trust.\n\n“We need more oversight and accountability,” Zuckerberg wrote. “People need to feel that global technology platforms answer to someone, so regulation should hold companies accountable when they make mistakes.”\n\nFollowing the introduction of the proposals on Wednesday, the public will have 12 weeks to comment. The European Commission will then officially propose legislation sometime later this year."

            "content": "The World Health Organization said recently that it may be 18 months before a vaccine against the coronavirus is publicly available. Let’s explore why, even with global efforts, it might take this long.\n\nVaccine for new coronavirus 'COVID-19' could be ready in 18 months: WHO https://t.co/8GrGDZf1AN pic.twitter.com/c7KQWxyTn3 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 11, 2020\n\nChina shared publicly the full RNA sequence of the virus – now known as SARS-CoV-2 rather than COVID-19, which refers to the disease itself – in the first half of January. This kickstarted efforts to develop vaccines around the world, including at the University of Queensland and institutions in the US and Europe.\n\nBy late January, the virus was successfully grown outside China for the first time by Melbourne’s Doherty Institute, a critically important step. For the first time, researchers in other countries had access to a live sample of the virus.\n\nUsing this sample, researchers at CSIRO’s high-containment facility, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, in Geelong, could begin to understand the characteristics of the virus, another crucial step in the global effort towards developing a vaccine.\n\nVaccines have historically taken two to five years to develop. But with a global effort, and learning from past efforts to develop coronavirus vaccines, researchers could potentially develop a vaccine in a much shorter time.\n\nHere’s why we need to work together.\n\nNo single institution has the capacity or facilities to develop a vaccine by itself. There are also more stages to the process than many people appreciate. First, we must understand the virus’s characteristics and behaviour in the host humans. To do this, we must first develop an animal model.\n\nNext, we must demonstrate that potential vaccines are safe and can trigger the right parts of the body’s immunity, without causing damage. Then we can begin pre-clinical animal testing of potential vaccines, using the animal model.\n\nVaccines that successfully pass pre-clinical testing can then be used by other institutions with the capacity to run human trials. Where these will be conducted, and by whom, has yet to be decided. Generally, it is ideal to test such vaccines in the setting of the current outbreak.\n\nFinally, if a vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will need to pass the necessary regulatory approvals. And a cost-effective way of making the vaccine will also need to be in place before the final vaccine is ready for delivery.\n\nEach of these steps in the vaccine development pipeline faces potential challenges.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has engaged our team in those first two steps: determining the characteristics of the current virus, then pre-clinical testing of potential vaccines.\n\nWhile Melbourne’s Doherty Institute and others have been instrumental in isolating the novel coronavirus, the next step for us is growing large amounts of it, so our scientists have enough to work with. This involves culturing the virus in the lab – i.e. encouraging it to grow – under especially secure and sterile conditions.\n\nThe next challenge we face is developing and validating the right biological model for the virus. This will be an animal model that gives us clues to how the coronavirus might behave in humans. Our previous work with the severe acute respiratory syndrome, better known as SARS, has given us a good foundation to build on.\n\nSARS is another member of the coronavirus family that spread during 2002-’03. Our scientists developed a biological model for SARS, using ferrets, in work to identify the original host of the virus: bats.\n\nSARS and the new SARS-CoV-2 share about 80-90% of their genetic code. So our experience with SARS means we are optimistic our existing ferret model can be used as a starting point for work on the novel coronavirus.\n\nWe will also explore other biological models to provide more robust data and as a contingency.\n\nOther challenges\n\nThere’s also the strong possibility that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to mutate. Being an animal virus, it has already likely mutated as it adapted – first to another animal, and then jumping from an animal to humans.\n\nInitially this was without transmission among people, but now it has taken the significant step of sustained human-to-human transmission. As the virus continues to infect people, it is going through something of a stabilisation, which is part of the mutation process.\n\nThis mutation process may even vary in different parts of the world, for various reasons.\n\nThis includes population density, which influences the number of people infected and how many opportunities the virus has to mutate. Prior exposure to other coronaviruses may also influence the population’s susceptibility to infection, which may result in variant strains emerging, much like seasonal influenza.\n\nTherefore, it’s crucial we continue to work with one of the latest versions of the virus to give a vaccine the greatest chance of being effective. All this work needs to be done under stringent quality and safety conditions, to ensure it meets global legislative requirements, and to ensure staff and the wider community are safe.\n\nAnother challenge is manufacturing proteins from the virus needed to develop potential vaccines. These proteins are specially designed to elicit an immune response when administered, allowing a person’s immune system to protect against future infection.\n\nFortunately, recent advances in understanding viral proteins, their structure and functions, has allowed this work to progress around the world at considerable speed.\n\nDeveloping a vaccine is a huge task and not something that can happen overnight. But if things go to plan, it will be much faster than we’ve seen before. So many lessons were learned during the SARS outbreak. And the knowledge the global scientific community gained from trying to develop a vaccine against SARS has given us a head-start on developing one for this virus.\n\nRob Grenfell, Director of Health and Biosecurity, CSIRO.

It’s still not totally clear how the coronavirus is spread or how long it can exist on surfaces, so the Chinese government is aiming to take old bills and coins out of circulation to stop one potential method of transmission. The central bank announced Saturday it had put a halt to the transfer of old bank notes across provinces and will use a variety of methods to sanitize the bills, including locking up the cash in government warehouses. The government said it is simultaneously injecting billions of dollars in new cash into the Chinese economy.\n\nThe deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China said Saturday the government is introducing 600 billion yuan ($85.9 billion) of new cash with four billion yuan ($572 million) in new notes already allocated in the virus’ epicenter in Hubei Province. “Money from key virus-hit areas will be sanitized with ultraviolet rays or heated and locked up for at least 14 days, before it is distributed again,” the deputy governor said at a press conference. Commercial lenders have also been ordered to identify cash taken specifically from hospitals and wet food markets, places with high exposure risk. The South China Morning Post reports the central bank in the southern city of Guangzhou is going one step further and will destroy all notes collected from these sensitive sites.\n\n“China reported 2,009 new cases of coronavirus and 142 associated deaths in the previous 24 hours on Sunday, days after the government changed the criteria for how it tracks cases,” the New York Times reports. “In all, more than 68,500 people have been infected and at least 1,669 have died worldwide, officials have said.

Commercial banks were told to place banknotes from infected areas aside, clean them, and hand them to the central bank.\n\nThe coronavirus continues to spread around the world and most heavily hit China's population. The outbreak is responsible for 1,670 deaths with nearly 70,000 infected as of Sunday afternoon. Coronavirus has already prompted economists to lower their expectations for global growth, and major corporations have warned that the drag on global supply chains will likely hit quarterly results.\n\nThe People's Bank of China will use high temperatures or ultraviolet light to disinfect bills and store the cash for more than 14 days before placing it back into circulation. Central banks around the world frequently destroy old notes to balance out the supply with new cash. The practice doesn't affect the money supply, though the coronavirus-related action is separate from such regular measures.\n\nAn unnamed deputy chief at a large bank in Guangzhou told Caixin that, while customers will be asked where their deposited cash is from, \"it would be difficult for such a measure to be completely effective.\"\n\nThe central bank's deputy governor, Fan Yifei, said on Saturday that 600 billion yuan ($85.6 billion) has been injected into China's financial system since January 17, according to the South China Morning Post. About 4 billion yuan had been sent to Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, before the Lunar New Year holiday on January 25.\n\nYifei also said the central bank will add more cash to banks to help businesses survive through the outbreak and lasting tensions borne from the US-China trade war, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nChina's economic growth has slowed through recent years as trade hurdles and slowing global expansion dragged on gross domestic product. The coronavirus is now expected to cut as much as 1.6 percentage points from its next-quarter growth, according to Goldman Sachs. The slowdown will also harm other Asian economies, with Taiwan, Korea, and Thailand the most exposed to lagging tourism and decreased export activity, Goldman analysts wrote in a note.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nTwo British Airways executives step down following the airline's first strike in decades\n\nMajor tech firms have a 'fundamental responsibility' to protect US elections, Microsoft's president says\n\nAmazon's cloud boss Andy Jassy shares advice on how to build a new business within a large company - these 4 principles helped AWS grow into a $35 billion business"

Experts had claimed that the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats in southern China is a “time bomb”.\n\nThe outbreak of coronavirus and SARS in China is believed to have passed from bats and other animals to humans in a wet market.\n\n“The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the re-emergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored,” a University of Hong Kong research paper said.\n\nAmerican Society for Microbiology had published this research paper titled ‘Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus as an Agent of Emerging and Re-emerging Infection’ report in October 2007.\n\nThe research paper said that the rapid economic growth in southern China has led to an increasing demand for animal proteins, including those from exotic game food animals such as civets. Large numbers and varieties of these wild game mammals in overcrowded cages and the lack of biosecurity measures in wet markets allowed the jumping of this novel virus varies from animals to humans.\n\n“The small re-emergence of SARS in late 2003 after the resumption of the wildlife market in southern China and the recent discovery of a very similar viruses in horseshoe bats, bat SARS-CoV, suggested that SARS can return if conditions are fit for the introduction, mutation, amplification, and transmission of this dangerous virus.\n\nThe paper was authored by Vincent C.C.

REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nThe scale of the crackdown, which has netted almost 40,000 animals including squirrels, weasels and boars, suggests that China’s taste for eating wildlife and using animal parts for medicinal purposes is not likely to disappear overnight, despite potential links to the new coronavirus.\n\nTraders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile and other meat told Reuters they plan to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen.\n\n“I’d like to sell once the ban is lifted,” said Gong Jian, who runs a wildlife store online and operates shops in China’s autonomous Inner Mongolia region. “People like buying wildlife. They buy for themselves to eat or give as presents because it is very presentable and gives you face.”\n\nGong said he was storing crocodile and deer meat in large freezers but would have to kill all the quails he had been breeding as supermarkets were no longer buying his eggs and they cannot be eaten after freezing.\n\nScientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from bats via pangolins, a small ant-eating mammal whose scales are highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nSome of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to Wuhan’s seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.\n\nThat may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country’s culture and history.\n\n“In many people’s eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man,” said Wang Song, a retired researcher of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nONLINE DEBATE\n\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,600 people in China, revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. It previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets.\n\nMany academics, environmentalists and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold.\n\nOnline debate within China, likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favored a permanent ban.\n\n“One bad habit is that we dare to eat anything,” said one commenter called Sun on a news discussion forum on Chinese website Sina. “We must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail.”\n\nNevertheless, a minority of Chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing the demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in Wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal.\n\nOne online commenter calling themselves Onlooker Pharaoh said on Chinese news platform Hupu that the risk was worth it: “Giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke.”\n\nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\n\nThe breeding and trading of wild animals in China is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people.\n\nAfter the SARS outbreak, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes.\n\nThese officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $20 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report.\n\n“The state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use,” said Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist for the Humane Society International. “It insists on China’s right to use wildlife resources for development purposes.”\n\nMuch of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. State-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and their own consumption.\n\nHowever, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild.\n\n“They just use this premise to do illegal trading,” Zhou Jinfeng, head of China’s Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Reuters. “There are no real pangolin farms in China, they just use the permits to do illegal things.”\n\nThe NFGA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBLURRED LINES\n\nAnimal products, from bear bile to pangolin scales, are still used in some traditional Chinese medicine, an industry China wants to expand as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nBut the distinction between legal and illegal is blurred. The United Nations estimates the global illegal wildlife trade is worth about $23 billion a year. China is by far the largest market, environmental groups say.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an independent organization based in London which campaigns against what it sees as environmental abuses, said in a report this week the coronavirus outbreak has in fact boosted some illegal wildlife trafficking as traders in China and Laos are selling rhinoceros horn medicines as a treatment to reduce fever.\n\nChina’s top legislature will toughen laws on wildlife trafficking this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported this week.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Chinese customs officials inspect scales of pangolins they seized on a ship in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China November 29, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer\n\n“We are in a sun-setting business,” said Xiang Chengchuan, a wholesale wildlife store owner in the landlocked eastern Anhui province. “Few people eat dogs now, but it was popular 20 years ago.”\n\nXiang, who sells gift boxes of deer antlers and dog, donkey and peacock meat to wealthy bank clients and others, said he had frozen his meat as he waits to see if the ban will continue.\n\n“I will resume selling once the policy allows us, but now I have no idea how long it (the ban) will last.”"

            "content": "Fourteen Americans tested positive for carrying the new coronavirus just as they began their return to the United States from Yokohama, Japan, where they had been trapped aboard the luxury cruise ship Diamond Princess in a quarantine that began February 3.\n\nAs of today, February 17, Japanese health officials have confirmed 454 cases of COVID-19 on the ship, including 99 cases reported since yesterday. The cluster is, by far, the largest of any COVID-19 flare ups outside of China, where the outbreak began and has caused the vast majority of infections and deaths.\n\nThe new cases in the returning Americans will nearly double the current number of COVID-19 cases in the US, bringing the total from the current 15 to 29.\n\nOriginally, no American cruise ship passengers infected with the new coronavirus were meant to leave Japan. When the US government announced plans on Saturday, February 15, to evacuate the roughly 400 Americans stuck on the cruise liner, it noted that sick passengers would stay in Japan for treatment.\n\nBut evacuation plans for over 300 other Americans were thrown into question as they disembarked the ship and made their way on buses to the airport where planes chartered by the US State Department awaited them. En route, US officials received the results of testing done two to three days earlier that determined that 14 of the evacuees were infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\nAfter some deliberation, US officials decided to allow the 14 travelers—who were asymptomatic as they disembarked the ship—to return to the States. The 14 flew back in a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft, isolating them from the other evacuees.\n\nThrown together\n\nAll returning ship passengers would be held in a 14-day federal quarantine in one of two military bases upon their arrival today.\n\nAccording to reports, 44 Americans tested positive for the virus and did remain in Japan. Others reported that they opted to stay on the ship and take their chances—a decision that may seem wise in retrospect.\n\nSacramento resident Matthew Smith, a passenger on the Diamond Princess, told CNN affiliate KOVR that he and his wife \"decided we would just face whatever consequences [on the ship] rather than exposing ourselves to that [evacuation] situation.\"\n\n\"It kind of didn't make any sense—if the US was fearful that these were infected people, which is why they're going to quarantine them for another two weeks—to have thrown them all together.\"\n\nThe messy evacuation highlights the difficulty of controlling the spread of the COVID-19—particularly on a cruise ship—as many infected with the novel coronavirus show mild to no symptoms. At the same time, hundreds of passengers who disembarked another cruise ship, the MS Westerdam in Cambodia, were being tracked after an 83-year-old American woman formerly aboard tested positive for the virus in Malaysia.\n\nUnpredictable\n\nIn a daily situation report today, experts at the World Health Organization noted that the latest data from more than 44,000 cases in China indicates that more than 80 percent of people infected have no more than mild disease and recover fully. Approximately 14 percent of infected have severe disease, including shortness of breath and pneumonia, and 5 percent have critical cases, involving respiratory failure, organ failure, and septic shock. The virus appears to be fatal in about 2 percent of cases in China, with the risk of death increasing with the age of the patient.\n\nThere are currently over 71,000 laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases worldwide, with 1,775 deaths. Of the cases, 794 are outside of China, scattered in 25 countries. Of the deaths, three have occurred outside of China.\n\nWhile the daily number of new cases has declined recently in China, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that the trend \"must be interpreted very cautiously.\"\n\n\"It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue,\" he said. \"Every scenario is still on the table.\"\n\nIt is likely that mild cases are underreported and that case tracking will become increasingly more difficult and complex.\n\nOfficials in the United States have said repeatedly that current quarantine efforts and travel restrictions are not intended to try to seal off the country from the virus—such an effort would be futile. Instead, the measures are intended to buy additional preparation time to ready for the likely scenario that cases will continue to arrive in the country."

Most of those deaths have occurred in China, where the outbreak is believed to have originated. As of the time of this writing, 73,325 people are believed to have been infected by the virus, which has now spread to 25 counties worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Outside of China, there have only been three confirmed deaths, according to WHO statistics, which were last updated on February 17.\n\nBut just who is the most likely to suffer a fatality from the disease? A major new analysis from China sheds some light on that, reports CNBC. The analysis looked at the records of 44,672 confirmed cases of the coronavirus from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), as well as 16,186 suspected cases. Its findings?\n\nMales are more likely to died from the coronavirus than females are. While the coronavirus has an overall fatality rate of 2.35% from the CCDC records analyzed, males in the group had a fatality rate of 2.8% while females had a fatality rate of just 1.7%.\n\nBottom line: It looks like the Wuhan coronavirus is killing men more often than women. That’s despite the COVID-19 virus infecting men and women almost equally. Of the records studied, 51% of people infected by the coronavirus were men, while 49% were women.\n\nHowever, experts were quick to point out to CNBC that the higher death rate among males might not be down to biology. It could be that social or environmental factors made those men more susceptible to dying from the disease.\n\nBut no matter if you’re a man or a woman, everyone can take the same precautions limiting their risk of exposure to the disease. On their website, the World Health Organization advises everyone to avoid people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequent hand-washing, and covering the nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing."

            "content": "The World Health Organisation said this week it may be 18 months before a vaccine against the coronavirus is publicly available.\n\nLet’s explore why, even with global efforts, it might take this long.\n\nChina shared publicly the full RNA sequence of the virus – now known as SARS-CoV-2 rather than COVID-19, which refers to the disease itself – in the first half of January.\n\nThis kickstarted efforts to develop vaccines around the world, including at the University of Queensland and institutions in the US and Europe.\n\nBy late January, the virus was successfully grown outside China for the first time, by Melbourne’s Doherty Institute, a critically important step. For the first time, researchers in other countries had access to a live sample of the virus.\n\nUsing this sample, researchers at CSIRO’s high-containment facility (the Australian Animal Health Laboratory) in Geelong, could begin to understand the characteristics of the virus, another crucial step in the global effort towards developing a vaccine.\n\nVaccines have historically taken two to five years to develop. But with a global effort, and learning from past efforts to develop coronavirus vaccines, researchers could potentially develop a vaccine in a much shorter time.\n\nHere’s why we need to work together\n\nNo single institution has the capacity or facilities to develop a vaccine by itself. There are also more stages to the process than many people appreciate.\n\nFirst, we must understand the virus’s characteristics and behaviour in the host (humans). To do this, we must first develop an animal model.\n\nNext, we must demonstrate that potential vaccines are safe and can trigger the right parts of the body’s immunity, without causing damage. Then we can begin pre-clinical animal testing of potential vaccines, using the animal model.\n\nVaccines that successfully pass pre-clinical testing can then be used by other institutions with the capacity to run human trials.\n\nWhere these will be conducted, and by whom, has yet to be decided. Generally, it is ideal to test such vaccines in the setting of the current outbreak.\n\nFinally, if a vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will need to pass the necessary regulatory approvals. And a cost-effective way of making the vaccine will also need to be in place before the final vaccine is ready for delivery.\n\nEach of these steps in the vaccine development pipeline faces potential challenges.\n\nHere are some of the challenges we face\n\nThe international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has engaged our team in those first two steps: determining the characteristics of the current virus, then pre-clinical testing of potential vaccines.\n\nWhile Melbourne’s Doherty Institute and others have been instrumental in isolating the novel coronavirus, the next step for us is growing large amounts of it so our scientists have enough to work with. This involves culturing the virus in the lab (encouraging it to grow) under especially secure and sterile conditions.\n\nThe next challenge we face is developing and validating the right biological model for the virus. This will be an animal model that gives us clues to how the coronavirus might behave in humans.\n\nOur previous work with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) has given us a good foundation to build on.\n\nSARS is another member of the coronavirus family that spread during 2002-03. Our scientists developed a biological model for SARS, using ferrets, in work to identify the original host of the virus: bats.\n\nSARS and the new SARS-CoV-2 share about 80-90% of their genetic code. So our experience with SARS means we are optimistic our existing ferret model can be used as a starting point for work on the novel coronavirus.\n\nWe will also explore other biological models to provide more robust data and as a contingency.\n\nWhat good will a vaccine be if the virus mutates?\n\nThere’s also the strong possibility that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to mutate.\n\nBeing an animal virus, it has already likely mutated as it adapted – first to another animal, and then jumping from an animal to humans.\n\nInitially this was without transmission among people, but now it has taken the significant step of sustained human-to-human transmission.\n\nAs the virus continues to infect people, it is going through something of a stabilisation, which is part of the mutation process.\n\nThis mutation process may even vary in different parts of the world, for various reasons.\n\nThis includes population density, which influences the number of people infected and how many opportunities the virus has to mutate. Prior exposure to other coronaviruses may also influence the population’s susceptibility to infection, which may result in variant strains emerging, much like seasonal influenza.\n\nTherefore, it’s crucial we continue to work with one of the latest versions of the virus to give a vaccine the greatest chance of being effective.\n\nAll this work needs to be done under stringent quality and safety conditions, to ensure it meets global legislative requirements, and to ensure staff and the wider community are safe.\n\nOther challenges ahead\n\nAnother challenge is manufacturing proteins from the virus needed to develop potential vaccines. These proteins are specially designed to elicit an immune response when administered, allowing a person’s immune system to protect against future infection.\n\nFortunately, recent advances in understanding viral proteins, their structure and functions, has allowed this work to progress around the world at considerable speed.\n\nDeveloping a vaccine is a huge task and not something that can happen overnight. But if things go to plan, it will be much faster than we’ve seen before.\n\nSo many lessons were learned during the SARS outbreak. And the knowledge the global scientific community gained from trying to develop a vaccine against SARS has given us a head-start on developing one for this virus.\n\nRob Grenfell, Director of Health and Biosecurity, CSIRO and Trevor Drew, Director of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), CSIRO\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

(There's no release date set in China yet — amidst the coronavirus crisis, lockdowns continue to hinder most everyday activities, which obviously includes going and sitting in large dark rooms in close quarters with a couple of hundred other people.)\n\nSonic beat out 2019's second-cutest critter, Detective Pikachu, which set the previous record for the biggest three-day opening weekend for a video game movie according to Box Office Mojo. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (the 2001 Angelina Jolie one) is bumped to third, and Angry Birds is down to a still-too-high fourth place.\n\nDespite these numbers, it's possible that this was still a missed opportunity. If the cowardly filmmakers hadn't caved to the online outrage mob after the initial trailer and redesigned the main character to be less \"creepy,\" \"nightmare fuel-y,\" and \"genuinely bone-chilling what the fuck,\" perhaps Sonic would already be a cult classic in the making in the vein of Cats.\n\nJust picture the rowdy screenings of Sonic, with audiences pelting gummy teeth candy at the screens whenever you glimpse his horribly child-like incisors, and people wearing blue tights with red sneakers to show off their alarmingly muscular calves."

            "content": "On January 23, the authorities of Wuhan City, China, sealed off the motorways and shut down all public transport to stop the coronavirus outbreak from spreading. Shortly afterwards, at least 10 other cities in China were under quarantine orders , most of them located in the areas surrounding Wuhan.\n\nIt sounds unbelievable to quarantine a city of 11 million people, but it may work because movement within and between cities in China relies heavily on public transport infrastructure. Major cities in China are well connected by airports, express railways, motorways, and long-distance buses. Once the entry points of these transport routes are controlled and patrolled, people cannot easily get out. The transport infrastructure is built by the state and over 90% funded by public money, so control remains in the hands of the authorities. The one-party government in China also helps to effectively implement such a strategy.\n\nAnother reason this containment strategy may work is that major Chinese cities are large and dense. Wuhan has an urban area of 1,528km2, which makes it extremely difficult for people to walk out of the city if they are not able to take public transport or travel on the motorways using private cars.\n\nPeople who live on the periphery of the city may still be able to get out through small local road networks that mainly lead to villages or the countryside. As long as the major roads are closed off, they are not able to reach other major cities with a large, concentrated population, and the quarantine remains effective.\n\nMegacity regions\n\nThe urbanization process facilitated by the Chinese state results in big cities surrounded by smaller cities, towns, and counties. This form of city cluster, known as megacity regions, are a recent phenomenon in China, and their development has been driven by both political and economic factors. The Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta are the most well-known megacity regions, holding enormous economic power and attracting laborers regionally and nationally.\n\nWuhan and its surrounding cities, towns, and counties hold a similar status in central China thanks to their strategic location on the Yangtze River and national railway network. The local authority’s Great Wuhan Economic Region plan is intended to promote Wuhan in efforts to become comparable to the aforementioned megacity regions.\n\nMegacity regions are connected by transport routes and mostly developed around transport nodes, at both the regional and neighborhood scales. This so-called transit-oriented development means that if the entry points of public transport are closed off in cities of the whole region, to a large extent, people are controlled in the region."

            "content": "What scientists think about China changing how it counts coronavirus cases The switch could making tracking the outbreak more complicated.\n\nWhen China last week changed the criteria for diagnosing and reporting patients with novel coronavirus in Hubei province, the result was a staggering 14,840 new cases -- and from Wednesday night into Thursday, another 242 deaths.\n\nExperts said they'd long suspected cases in China had been undercounted. In Hubei, the outbreak's epicenter, medical professionals have struggled to keep up with an onslaught of patients, and hospitals without enough test kits have turned people away.\n\n\"One of the concerns has always been that they don't count the patients who have mild illness, because they don't have the resources to do so,\" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa.\n\nThrough Friday, China had reported a total of 63,851 cases and 1,380 deaths, including those detected using the new criteria.\n\nPeople wear face masks as they wait at Hankou Railway Station on January 22, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Stringer/Getty Images\n\nPreviously, cases were reported only when patients tested positive for the virus using a diagnostic test. By expanding the criteria to include so-called clinically diagnosed cases, doctors can diagnose patients without laboratory testing, using methods such as CT lung scans. Giving doctors the discretion to treat patients without lab tests allows them to more quickly administer treatments, Chinese health authorities explained in a statement.\n\nAlthough the switch came suddenly, health experts said changing the case definition while investigating a previously unknown outbreak is not unusual.\n\nOn one hand, it's possible that giving doctors the latitude to diagnose without lab tests could provide a more realistic picture of case counts and mortality rates for COVID-19. But on the other hand, CT scans aren't specific to coronavirus, explained Dr. Arthur Reingold, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\"It introduces additional challenges in interpreting the numbers,\" he said.\n\nA community worker checks the temperature of courier in an Express station on January 29, 2020 in Hubei Province, Wuhan, China. Getty Images\n\nThe World Health Organization said it wants more clarity on how clinicians in Hubei are making diagnoses, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director general, said Friday during a news briefing in Geneva. The fear is that without lab tests, diseases with similar symptoms could get counted as COVID-19 cases.\n\nSince there's no known treatment for novel coronavirus, the change shouldn't hinder patients' ability to get care. But for scientists tracking the outbreak, it could muddy the waters.\n\nIt's important \"to ensure other respiratory illnesses, including influenza, aren't getting mixed into the COVID-19 data,\" Tedros warned. The WHO continues to report cases using its own numbers, which don't include the clinically diagnosed cases coming out of Hubei.\n\nAccording to WHO figures, 48,548 cases had been reported through Friday.\n\n\"It's wonderful, clinically,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \"It's not very helpful, epidemiologically.\"\n\nThe members of the medical team of the people's Hospital of Northern Jiangsu were at the expedition ceremony to help Wuhan. Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, Feb. 13, 2020. Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nWith constantly changing definitions, it's harder to track the outbreak and complicates determining the effectiveness of quarantines.\n\n\"Anyone who is knowledgeable would be very cautious in saying are numbers going up, or down, or leveling,\" Reingold said.\n\n\"You have to have a modicum of consistency over time,\" Schaffner added. \"You can't start with counting just spades, and then add diamonds, and subtract hearts and add in clubs at the end. That's just confusion.\"\n\nStill, Reingold acknowledged that armchair analysis among epidemiologists doesn't take into account the realities on the ground in Hubei.\n\n\"They are busy dealing with an enormous problem,\" he said. \"It's easy for me to sit in Berkeley and say could they do X, Y and Z.\"\n\nABC News' Karson Yiu contributed to this report."

Automakers are gradually reopening factories in China that were idled by anti-virus control. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) The Associated Press\n\nBEIJING -- Automakers are reopening factories in China that were idled by anti-virus controls as they try to reverse a sales slump in their biggest market.\n\nLocal officials have orders from the ruling Communist Party to get businesses functioning again while still enforcing anti-disease curbs that shut down much of the world’s second-largest economy.\n\n“Local governments are putting their full weight behind helping businesses open,” the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Ker Gibbs, said in a statement.\n\nToyota Motor Co. said two factories reopened Monday with one of the usual two daily shifts working. Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co., Mercedes Benz and Chinese brand Geely resumed some operations last week. General Motors Co. said a “staggered start” across its factories began Saturday. Nissan Motor Co. plans to restart this week.\n\nAutomakers say they are checking employees for the virus's telltale fever, barring visitors and telling employees to stay home if they have been in Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, or other areas that have imposed travel curbs.\n\nThe outbreak prompted the government to extend the Lunar New Year holiday to keep factories and offices closed and workers at home.\n\nThe government has told employees who can work from home to stay there, but China’s vast manufacturing industries that supply the world with smartphones, toys and other goods need workers in factories.\n\nObstacles include a requirement for workers who return from other areas — as millions are doing after the holiday — to make sure they are virus-free by staying at home for its 14-day incubation period.\n\n“Most factories have a severe shortage of workers, even after they are allowed to open,” said Gibbs. “This is going to have a severe impact on global supply chains that is only beginning to show up.”\n\nAutomakers are under pressure to reverse a 2-year-old sales decline in a Chinese market they hope will propel global revenue.\n\nSales of SUVs, minivans and sedans hit an annual peak of 24.7 million in 2017 and have declined since then. Last year’s sales tumbled 9.6% to 21.4 million.\n\nThe virus “adds to the challenges that the sector is already facing,” said Fitch Ratings in a report.\n\nGroupe Renault said one of its factories in the southern city of Guangzhou, near Hong Kong, reopened Monday but the French automaker gave no indication of the status of another factory in Wuhan.\n\nSales of vehicles are likely to be depressed through April, Fitch said. It said production might fall by the high single digits in the first half of 2020 compared with a year earlier.\n\nGM, Toyota and others said the pace of production depends on how fast they can restart the flow of components from thousands of Chinese suppliers that also shut down.\n\nThat disruption could have global repercussions: UBS estimates China supplies 8% of auto parts exports worldwide.\n\n———\n\nAP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed."

            "content": "On Monday, budget-lodging startup Oyo reported a loss of $335 million on $951 million revenue globally for the financial year ending March 31, 2019, and pledged to cut down on its spending as the India-headquartered firm grows cautious about its aggressive expansion.\n\nThe six-year-old startup’s growing revenue, up from $211 million in financial year ending March 31, 2018 (FY18), is in line with the company’s ambitions to be in a clear path to profitability this year, said Abhishek Gupta, Global CFO of OYO Hotels & Homes, in a statement.\n\nBut the startup’s loss has widened, too. Its consolidated loss at $335 million in FY19 rose over sixfold from $52 million in FY18. In India, where Oyo clocked $604 million in revenue in FY19 (up 2.9X since FY18), it was able to reduce its loss to 14 percent (from 24 percent) of revenue in FY19 to $83 million.\n\nIndian laws require every local startup — and international businesses — to disclose their annual financials. Most of them filed their financials in early October.\n\nThe startup, which today operates more than 43,000 hotels with over a million rooms in 800 cities in 80 nations, said its expansion in China and other international markets contributed to the loss. Oyo entered China in 2018, and says the world’s most populated nation has already become its second largest market.\n\n“These markets constituted 36.5 percent of the global revenues. While consistently improving operating economics in mature markets like India where it’s already seeing an improvement in gross margins, the company is determined to bring in the same fiscal discipline in emerging markets in the coming financial year,” the startup said in a statement.\n\nAditya Ghosh, who served as a chief executive of the startup and is now a board member, said in a call with reporters that since Oyo entered a number of markets last year it was in the growth phase and that needed some investments. Speaking especially of China, Ghosh said the company, like many others, is watching the outbreak of coronavirus that has resulted in shutting down some hotels.\n\nHe also said that Oyo has pared back from some markets, including India, where it pulled out of about 200 cities. The startup is currently not looking to expand to any new markets, he added.\n\nIt is now working on improving its gross margin. In India, its gross margin increased to 14.7% from 10.6% as of FY18.\n\nOyo has come under scrutiny in recent months for its aggressive expansion in a manner that some analysts have said is not sustainable. The startup, which rebrands and renovates independent budget hotels, has also engaged in sketchy ways to sign up new hotels, as documented by the New York Times earlier this year. Several hoteliers have claimed that Oyo did not honor its agreements and owed them money.\n\nIn 2019, Oyo, which counts Airbnb among its investors, expanded in Europe and the U.S. among other markets. It bought Leisure Group from Axel Springer for $415 million to target Europe’s vacation rental market. It also announced plans to invest another $335 million for this effort. In the same month, it announced it had acquired the Hooters Casino Hotel Las Vegas for about $135 million in its first U.S. property purchase.\n\nIt also entered Japan in a partnership with SoftBank. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that Oyo currently has about 12,000 rooms in the country, far fewer than its ambitious 1 million target.\n\nIn recent months, Oyo executives have acknowledged that the startup grew too fast and is confronting a number of “teething issues.” Oyo has laid off at least 3,000 employees, mostly in India, in last three months. Ghosh said the startup is still hiring for new roles, but only in key areas such as data science.\n\n“The company’s increased focus on corporate governance and building a high-performing and employee-first work culture will also drive this next phase of sustainable growth for us,” said Gupta."

            "content": "ARTICLE\n\nTo print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nThe number of reported cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) continues to rise – at this writing, topping 40,000 infected with more than 900 deaths – and the world is on high alert.\n\nThe World Health Organization (the WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, to date, 2019-nCoV has been detected in more than 25 countries with 12 cases confirmed in the United States. The US State Department has upgraded its travel advisory for China to Level 4: Do Not Travel, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has bumped its own travel advisory for China to Warning Level 3, recommending that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to China.\n\nWhat is coronavirus? According to the WHO, coronavirus usually causes respiratory illness. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. The WHO recommends a number of precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, including regular hand washing, covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. The WHO also suggests that people avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing.\n\nWhy should employers take action? Under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and applicable state and local laws, employers have a general duty to provide employees with safe workplace conditions that are “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.”\n\nGiven the ongoing outbreak, and an evolving understanding of 2019-nCoV, including its transmission and incubation, it is important for employers to consider what preventative measures they can take to maintain safety and protect their employees from potentially contracting coronavirus as well.\n\nWhat can employers do when employees wish to travel to China? Employers may want to restrict employees from traveling to China unless necessary, as advised by the State Department and the CDC. While the Chinese government has placed the city of Wuhan, and other high-risk cities, under lockdown, and international travel to China has been reduced by commercial air carriers, the virus still continues to spread. If employees must travel, they should follow basic infection control precautions by engaging in careful hygiene with soap and water and hand sanitizer; avoid contact with sick people; avoid contact with animals and uncooked animal products; and wear personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nWhat about employees traveling from China to the US? Based upon new travel restrictions, Americans travelling to the US who have been to the Hubei province in China in the last 14 days may be subject to up to 14 days mandatory quarantine. US citizens who have been to other parts of Mainland China in the past 14 days are subject to screening at designated airports and are subject to 2 weeks of monitored self-quarantine. Foreign nationals who were recently in China are currently being denied entry into the US.\n\nAs a result, employers must put in place protocols for: (1) employees who have traveled to the Hubei province and are subject to the mandatory quarantine and are not permitted to return to the workplace; (2) asymptomatic employees who have traveled to mainland China and are under monitored self-quarantine; and (3) employees who have traveled to China (or have had contact with someone who recently has) and demonstrate symptoms consistent with a cold.\n\nFor those in the first two groups, employers should encourage employees to adhere to the quarantine restrictions and either work remotely or take time off work. As to their work status, if an employee does not have adequate sick time or vacation time, employers should consider providing leave to a potential incubating employee consistent with its leave policies, including allowing employees to use all forms of available paid leave. As to the third group, employees with symptoms should be encouraged to visit a medical office and stay home away from others for 14 days. Employers should again consider offering the opportunity to work remotely or offer a leave of absence to symptomatic employees consistent with its leave policies. The common theme here is that employers (and non-incubating employees) are better off safe than sorry.\n\nEmployers should be aware that by encouraging remote work, employers may later face resistance to future limitations to do so (for example, as a request for a reasonable accommodation). Employees (even those not impacted by the instant travel to China) may argue that it is not reasonable to limit remote work given the employer’s encouragement to do so at one point in time. For example, some businesses limit employees’ ability to work from home because they require employees to interface personally with customers or clients, and they would not want to set precedent that makes it more difficult to deny other requests in the future without being accused of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or similar state or local law. Accordingly, such employers would be well served to document the unique circumstances leading to the remote work due to risk of coronavirus that may or may not be applicable to other health conditions.\n\nCan employers require medical examinations for employees who have visited China recently? Employers likely cannot require employees who have visited Wuhan, China, or China generally, to undergo a medical examination upon their return, especially if they are asymptomatic. The ADA prohibits employers from requiring medical examinations unless they are job-related and consistent with business necessity, such as if the employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. A direct threat is “a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.” Given the precautions currently being taken upon reentry to the US, it is unlikely that an asymptomatic employee may be considered a direct threat. ADA-covered employers may not require asymptomatic employees to undergo medical examinations unless the coronavirus reaches pandemic status more severe than the H1N1 virus of 2009. However, if an employee returning from Wuhan, China, or China generally, demonstrates symptoms, this presents a very different situation, as it may present a direct threat to the health of coworkers and him or herself.\n\nWhat about employees who express concerns about travel outside of the US (even outside of China)?\n\nIf an employee notifies the employer of an underlying health condition or other sensitive reason impacting their desire to travel (eg, pregnant workers, mental health-related fear of flying), the employer needs to consider a reasonable accommodation consistent with the way the employer handles similar requests to avoid running afoul of the ADA, state or local law. This potential concern from an employee needs to be weighed against any non-medically verified fears of contracting the coronavirus during any travel so that employers can continue to operate the business and keep employees employed.\n\nHow do employers address key employees working on critical business projects who refuse to travel to China (or other international destinations)? This becomes a risk analysis for each company, dependent on the factual circumstances and options available. If the employee refuses to perform the functions set forth in the job description or employment agreement, those present legitimate grounds for discipline, up to and including termination. For any workers who are working for employers under an employment contract in place (as opposed to at-will) that requires travel, if the employee refuses to carry out the terms of the contract, the employee would technically be in breach of the contract and the employer may be able to argue that that the employee’s refusal is tantamount to a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This would provide an additional legitimate basis for any disciplinary actions.\n\nHowever, if employees inform the employer that they do not want to travel for fear of contracting a disease like coronavirus (at a time when the WHO has characterized it as a “Level 4 - Do Not Travel”), these employees could argue under Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines (or the relevant state law equivalent) that in the face of any adverse employment action for refusing to travel, they are being subjected to disciplinary action for opposing unsafe working conditions. In addition, a company may even face allegations that it has negligently exposed its employees to a communicable disease - as has recently been asserted against an aviation company, when a union filed a petition on behalf of its employees for injunctive relief.\n\nWhile employers generally have broad discretion to decide the job requirements of employees, employers should balance operational business needs with any reasonable concerns raised by their employees, and should consider reasonable alternatives to accomplish their business objectives.\n\nHow can employers limit the outbreak’s spread in the US? While this has not become a pandemic, the EEOC has previously stated that during a pandemic, employers may require employees to wear PPE, such as a face mask. If that time comes, employers will need to be aware of the need to accommodate employees with disabilities who require specific types of PPE (eg, non-latex gloves). Unfortunately for companies in the US and elsewhere, the very measures that are designed to protect workers may result in a slowdown of the speed at which employees can work. Employers and employees would undoubtedly face a slowdown at work simply by requiring employees to change in and out of protective wear and keep a high level of personal hygiene to ensure no cross-contamination. Employers will also need to be aware of wage-and-hour issues that may be triggered by the changing in/out of PPE.\n\nIt is imperative that employers stay updated with developments regarding coronavirus and its status in the US. In the event of a pandemic, employers should engage employees in a discussion regarding: (1) the responsibility of management to remove sick people from the workplace or to provide adequate systems of isolation; (2) the appropriate PPE gear to provide workers; (3) whether management will provide protection, such as immunization against the coronavirus, when available; (4) creating worker committees to discuss workplace safety concerns, including potentially sensitive personnel (eg, pregnant workers, breastfeeding workers, elderly workers, workers requesting compassionate leave after bereavement).\n\nWhat can employers do now? Employers should evaluate workplace emergency response protocols and consider what, if any, modifications are necessary to address a potential coronavirus pandemic. Protocols should include contact information for employer representatives who can provide additional information to workers about how the coronavirus may impact their safety in the workplace. Most importantly, prudent employers should keep themselves informed of news updates. Check the CDC website regularly for updates, and keep an open dialogue with all levels of employees about their concerns about coronavirus, without creating hysteria; remain informed about whether any employees become symptomatic, while keeping the workplace as safe and clean as possible in order to limit any potential spread of the coronavirus. Finally, consistent with the above recommendations in case of a pandemic, employers should be deliberate in creating strategies for continuing business operations if the outbreak turns into a pandemic.\n\nThe content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances."

The news comes less than a week after the U.S. Commerce Department issued a 45-day extension to allow American firms to continue trading with Huawei.\n\nBy altering the Foreign Direct Product Rule, the U.S. government will be able to force foreign companies using American chipmaking equipment to get a U.S. license before they can supply chips to Huawei. While the U.S. Commerce Department declined to comment on the draft proposal, Huawei is yet to respond to requests for comment.\n\nCiting a trusted source, the Reuters report says while the chip proposal has been drafted, it isn't certain that it will be approved. Needless to say, the proposal would be a massive blow to both Huawei as well as TSMC. The Taiwanese chipmaker has been working with Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon to manufacture Kirin chipsets for a long time now.\n\nA report from China's Everbright Securities had revealed that the majority of chip makers depend on U.S. equipment. Manufacturing any chipsets without U.S. equipment would be very difficult as there is no production line in China that uses only 'made in China' equipment."

Organizers of the Tokyo Marathon set for March 1, 2020 are drastically reducing the number of participants out of fear of the spread of the coronavirus from China. The general public is essentially being barred from the race. (Kyodo News via AP) The Associated Press\n\nTOKYO -- Tokyo Marathon organizers drastically reduced the number of participants for this year's race on Monday out of fear of the spread of the virus coming from China.\n\nThe general public is being barred from the race on March 1. It will now be limited to a few hundred elite participants, organizers said in a brief statement.\n\n“We cannot continue to launch the event within the scale we originally anticipated and we regret to inform you the following: The Tokyo Marathon 2020 will be held only for the marathon elites and the wheelchair elites,” organizers said.\n\nThe Tokyo Marathon is the city's annual race and not to be confused with the Olympic marathon that will take place during the 2020 Tokyo Games. Those races are to be held in the northern city of Sapporo.\n\nThe marathon is the latest large sports event to be impacted by the virus. Almost all sports events in China over the next few months have been called off, including next month's world indoor track and field championships and a Formula One race in April.\n\nThe cancellations in China have a domino effect on Olympic qualifying, both in China and elsewhere, and muddle the picture for thousands of hopeful Olympians, families, and their travel plans.\n\nThe Tokyo Marathon was expected to attract about 38,000 participants. Only one death in Japan has been attributed to the virus. The latest death toll in mainland China is 1,770.\n\nOrganizers of the Tokyo Olympics and the International Olympic Committee have said repeatedly they will not cancel or postpone the games and are following the advice of the World Health Organization.\n\n“Certainly the advice we're receiving externally from the WHO is that there's no case for any contingency plans or cancelling the games or moving the games,” John Coates, the head of an IOC inspection team, said Friday in Tokyo.\n\nThe Olympics open on July 24 with about 11,000 athletes participating. About 7.8 million tickets are available for Olympic events, which draw hundreds of thousands of tourists. There are another 2.3 million tickets for the Paralympics.\n\nMuch of the focus in now on China. It will further intensify with the next Olympics — the 2022 Winter Games — taking place in Beijing.\n\nThe spreading virus has already forced organizers to cancel World Cup ski races this month in Yanquig, China, which were also to serve as test events. Also called off was a biathlon test event in Zhangjiakou.\n\nAlso Monday, the International Weightlifting Federation said the upcoming Asian championships will be relocated from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan because of travel restrictions related to the virus. Kazakhstan borders China but hasn't reported any cases.\n\nThe event will now be held in Tashkent from April 16-25.\n\n———\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP—Sports"

Four others who had attended the gathering in December were arrested previously, Hua told Reuters.\n\nXu was arrested on Saturday night by the Beijing police with assistance by police in Guangzhou, Hua said.\n\nThe Beijing and Guangzhou city police did not respond immediately to faxed requests for comment.\n\nXu's girlfriend, who was in Beijing, has not been reachable since Saturday, according to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch China researcher Yaqiu Wang.\n\nXu, a long-time activist for judicial and legal reform, in 2012 founded the New Citizens Movement, which called on government officials to disclose their wealth. He was sentenced in 2014 to four years in prison for his work with the group.\n\nIn recent weeks, Xu had written many articles criticising Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 70,000 people in China and killed 1,770.\n\nIn a Feb 4 article published on a website that is blocked in China and belongs to the New Citizens Movement, Xu called on Chinese President Xi Jinping to resign, citing his handling of crises, from Hong Kong's anti-government protests to the epidemic that originated in the central city of Wuhan.\n\n\"Medical supplies are tight, and the hospitals are overcrowded with people, and a large number of those infected are unable to have their cases verified,\" Xu wrote. \"You say you personally directed the deployment, it is a mess.\"\n\n\"Mr. Xi Jinping, please give way,\" he wrote.\n\nXu also criticized restrictions on Chinese media reporting of the epidemic centred in Wuhan and the strict lockdown measures implemented to contain it.

Tom Cotton is persistently resurfacing a debunked conspiracy theory which claims the deadly coronavirus sweeping the globe is the work of Chinese scientists at a secret Wuhan lab for biological warfare.\n\nThe Republican senator raised concerns about the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory while appearing on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" on Fox News.\n\n\"Now, we don't have evidence that this disease originated there, but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning we need to at least ask the question,\" Cotton said of the lab.\n\n\"This virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market,\" he said.\n\nThe National Biosafety Laboratory is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and is classed \"Cellular Level Biosafety Level 4\" — meaning it works on the most dangerous pathogens, like Ebola, according to the lab's website.\n\n\"Borderline irresponsible\"\n\nCotton's theory has already been thoroughly debunked by multiple scientists.\n\n\"There's absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered,\" Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told The Washington Post Sunday.\n\n\"The possibility this was a deliberately released bioweapon can be firmly excluded.\"\n\nThis scanning electron microscope image shows SARS-CoV-2 (orange)—also known as 2019-nCoV, the virus that causes COVID-19—isolated from a patient in the U.S., emerging from the surface of cells (green) cultured in the lab. Associated Press\n\nVipin Narang, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also told The Post it was \"a skip in logic to say it's a bioweapon\" or claim China \"developed and intentionally deployed, or even unintentionally deployed\" the virus.\n\n\"I don't think it's particularly helpful, and it's borderline irresponsible to — and it's without evidence, so at this point it's a conspiracy theory — peddle it,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nA volunteer offers hand sanitizer to passengers. In light of a coronavirus outbreak in China, Hong Kong district councilors and residents formed makeshift quarantine stations, screening passengers arriving from China. Citizens measured passenger's temperatures and offered hand sanitizer. Willie Siau/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nIn a Sunday tweet, CNN's Jake Tapper also quoted an unnamed healthcare expert as saying Cotton's theory was nonsense.\n\n\"The rumor is circulating but there is no evidence to date that this is true,\" the expert said, according to Tapper.\n\n\"Hopefully the WHO team will get the samples from the original cases and we will be able to figure this out. Until then, I put it in the conspiracy theory bucket.\"\n\nIn response, Cotton doubled down on his claims, saying in a series of tweets: \"It's not a 'theory' and certainly not a 'conspiracy theory,' but rather a hypothesis.\"\n\n\"But given the CCP's ongoing dishonesty, we have to examine the hypothesis and demand the evidence,\" he added, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSuspicion over the origins of the coronavirus comes as China continues to search for a cure, and faces accusations that it had suppressed information about the virus. When the SARS coronavirus broke out in China in the early 2000s, the government initially covered it up.\n\nPassengers who just arrived on a train from Wuhan, China are screened for coronavirus in Beijing. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nCotton has aired this theory as early as February 9, saying in a tweet: \"Fact: super-lab is just a few miles from that market.\"\n\n\"Where did it start? We don't know. But burden of proof is on you & fellow communists. Open up now to competent international scientists,\" he added.\n\nThe theory has also been seriously considered by the Daily Mail and The Washington Times.\n\nHowever, the Wuhan lab at the center of the theory is actually \"relatively open compared with other Chinese institutes\" and \"has strong ties\" to a number of similar US institutes, The Post reported.\n\nDisinformation battle\n\nMedical workers, government officials, and social media networks are trying to mute swaths of misinformation relating to the coronavirus.\n\nFacebook said in January that it will try to delete, or at least decrease the reach of, posts peddling false information on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nZero Hedge, a popular financial blog, was permanently suspended from Twitter in January for peddling the same theory as Cotton.\n\nThe outlet had published an article titled \"Is This The Man Behind The Global Coronavirus Pandemic?\" which blamed a scientists at Wuhan's Institute of Virology for releasing the virus.\n\nAnd according to The Post, Hu Xijin, editor Chinese's state-run Global Times tabloid, said there was actually a conspiracy theory in China that the US made the virus."

Originally introduced in Oct. 2016, the Solar Roof was re-worked several times, and has only gone into wider distribution this year, partially due to Tesla's well-documented struggles to produce its Model 3 at volume.\n\nBut it now seems Tesla is serious about making its Solar Roof ubiquitous. On Sunday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed on Twitter that the company plans to offer the roof internationally \"later this year.\"\n\nLooking forward to international expansion later this year 😀 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 16, 2020\n\nMusk would not name individual countries in which the roof would be offered, but he did say that the roof will initially be produced in Tesla's Gigafactory in New York, with production going international with time.\n\nTesla's Solar Roof simplifies (and, ideally, reduces cost of) the process of installing solar panels on your roof by combining the panels and tiles into one. Musk often highlighted the Roof's appearance, claiming that it's visually far more appealing than traditional solar panels and traditional roofs.\n\nMusk also encouraged all interested to apply for a job in Tesla's Solar Roof team. The company is hiring roofers and installers in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Utah. and Virginia.\n\nThere's a worrying bit of news today regarding Tesla's international production expansion, though. According to Reuters, the company was forced to pause prep work for its Berlin Gigafactory after a local environmentalist group filed a complaint with a German court. The plant — Tesla's fourth massive factory, besides two in the U.S. and one in China — is scheduled to be operational in July 2021."

Apple Inc. said it would miss its quarterly revenue target because of the virus.\n\nThe U.S. evacuated citizens from the Diamond Princess cruise liner, including 14 who tested positive for the virus, and will quarantine more than 300 passengers. The U.S. is still figuring out what to do with American passengers on another cruise ship who disembarked in Cambodia, including one who tested positive.\n\nBeijing may delay a high-profile political meeting for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 71,000 and killed 1,775 globally.\n\nKey Developments\n\nChina death toll 1,770, up 105; mainland cases rise to 70,548Hubei adds 1,933 new cases, up from 1,843 a day earlierFour missed chances for China to contain outbreakFears of global contagion as 3,000 cruise passengers go home\n\nClick VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the novel coronavirus and here for maps and charts. For analysis of the impact from Bloomberg Economics, click here.\n\nApple to Miss Guidance Because of Virus (4:15 p.m. NY)\n\nApple Inc. doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the quarter ending in March due to work slowdowns from the outbreak of coronavirus in China. The company said it anticipates global supply of the iPhone to be “temporarily constrained.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJapan Cruisers Quarantined; Westerdam Passengers Loose (3:19 p.m. NY)\n\nMore than 300 U.S. citizens evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have returned home to begin a 14-day quarantine on military bases and for treatment in hospitals.\n\nThe repatriation ends a dramatic episode on the virus-struck ship, but came with a fresh complication: As the U.S. cruise passengers were on a bus heading for Tokyo’s Haneda Airport, Japanese test results showed that 14 had the virus. And a positive test from another cruise ship that disembarked passengers in Cambodia has raised concerns about further spread of the virus around the globe.\n\nOf the Japan evacuees, 171 will be held at Travis Air Force Base between San Francisco and Sacramento, with six people sent to a local hospital for treatment, said William Walters, a senior official with the State Department‘s Bureau of Medical Services.\n\nA further 144 passengers evacuated on a separate flight will be housed at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas. Seven people on that flight were flown on to Omaha for treatment at the University of Nebraska.The newly diagnoses cases involved people who did not show any symptoms of the coronavirus but were diagnosed by Japanese lab tests, Walters said.The fate of hundreds of Americans coming off another cruise ship now docked in Cambodia is less clear. One of the passengers, an 83-year-old woman, was diagnosed with the virus while passing through Malaysia, and is being held in isolation there. Roughly 300 U.S. citizens who were on the Westerdam have left Cambodia, according to the State Department. But 92 remain on the ship and a further 260 are staying in hotels in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital.Walter said the U.S. government was tracking those citizens but had not yet made a decision on whether to send special flights to bring them home. Health officials across the world have said that catching and isolating cases of the virus before it spreads is crucial to stopping it.\n\nDamage Cause by Virus Resembles SARS, MERS (2 p.m. NY)\n\nDoctors studying a 50-year-old man who died in China last month from the new coronavirus found that the disease caused lung damage reminiscent of two prior coronavirus-related outbreaks, SARS and MERS.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nCruise Travel Risks Remain ‘Manageable’ Despite Virus, WHO Says: (12 p.m. NY)\n\nCruise ship travel remains a “manageable risk” for now, and it doesn’t make sense to recommend a ban on it, the World Health Organization said, even as the return home of 3,000 travelers from two coronavirus-stricken cruise ships fuels fears of further contagion.\n\n“People say we should steer clear of cruise ships, or steer clear of airports or steer clear of certain ethnic groups,” Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, said at a press briefing Monday at the organization’s Geneva headquarters. “We have to be really careful” of such suggestions. “We need an approach to managing risk that allows us to continue to operate as a society.”\n\nStory continues"

This afternoon, I shared this update with our community of shareholders and investors to note that we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter.

Apple also says it is more than doubling its previously announced donation to help in the public health fight against the Wuhan coronavirus.Apple had predicted in its earnings release at the end of January that it would see revenue of $63–$67 billion for the March quarter, a somewhat wider guidance range than usual as Apple acknowledged the coronavirus situation was leading to some uncertainty, but it appears the impact will be even larger than Apple had accounted for.: Bloomberg has shared Tim Cook's memo to Apple employees addressing the situation:"

            "content": "For much of the Communist Party’s history, the overarching question in its elite circles has not been whether democracy or authoritarianism is more attractive, but which version of authoritarianism is best. As documented in research by Jonathan Stromseth, Edmund Malesky, and Dimitar Gueorguiev, there have always been two schools of thought: a more coercive model, and one based more on openness to and participation by citizens and elites alike. Xi Jinping is firmly in the coercive camp, but the coronavirus outbreak has become a tragic case study of what’s wrong with his method of governance.\n\nChina today is arguably the most repressive it has been since the period following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Xi has fostered a cult of personality; removed any semblance of opposition within the Communist Party; centralized power around himself; gutted civil society; jailed hundreds of human-rights, labor, feminist, and pro-democracy activists; and tightened control of social and traditional media. His answer for how to best to govern Chinese society: Control it. Dominate it.\n\nA public-health crisis is exacerbated by such a government. Local officials in Wuhan and Hubei province, too scared to report bad news in their jurisdictions, were slow to act during the onset of the outbreak. Health-care workers and citizen journalists who tried to warn the public were censored and detained, including the heroic whistle-blower Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist who later died of the virus himself.\n\nCitizens and health experts need good information, but most official statistics in China are unreliable. Chinese colleagues of mine whisper, based on past experience, that the government must be radically underestimating the number of deaths. Nobody really knows how many people have the virus, and even expert baseline estimates of its mortality rate are unreliable. Some observers are even looking to air pollution near crematoriums to try to deduce death totals.\n\nThese issues aside, Americans should be skeptical of any “coming collapse of China” predictions. The Communist Party has a well-defined playbook for handling the deadly crises that have arisen on its watch.\n\nStep 1: Find a local official to take the blame. In political science, we often describe China’s governing system as one of “fragmented authoritarianism.” Responsibility for making and implementing policies is diffused across multiple levels of government. This structure allows for easy scapegoating in times of crisis. For the coronavirus, local officials in Wuhan and Hubei have been blamed for mishandling the outbreak. Jiang Chaoliang, the highest-ranking official in Hubei, recently resigned in disgrace.\n\nStep 2: Respond aggressively, even excessively. When a crisis arises, the central government will take great pains to show that it cares. This is what the author Ian Johnson recently called “Actionism”—action for action’s sake. This response might come in the form of a new law, or visits by top officials to the affected area. Entire cities, roughly 50 million people, have been quarantined in response to the coronavirus. And on evening television, the news shows clips of cranes and cement mixers building whole hospitals in just a matter of days. (Of note: These machines have become internet celebrities in China)."

            "content": "Kristina Shramko, a 21-year-old Canadian citizen, is quarantined in Wuhan, China, amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe entire city of Wuhan is under lockdown, along with other cities throughout China's Hubei province.\n\nShramko said she has refused to leave because her government won't allow her cat on an evacuation flight.\n\nShe has been filming YouTube videos inside her loft, and said the quarantine has taken a mental toll.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nKristina Shramko hasn't been outside in a full week.\n\nThe last time she left her loft in Wuhan, China, officers in the supermarket across the street checked her temperature before she entered the store to buy groceries. She wore a mask — a requirement in Wuhan as of late January — and officers patrolled the store to make sure patrons complied, Shramko said.\n\nWuhan has been under lockdown since January 23 because the 11-million-person city is the origin point of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The COVID-19 virus, as it's now known, has so far infected at least 67,000 people and killed more than 1,500. (For the latest case total, death toll, and travel information, see Business Insider's live updates here.) The majority of those cases are in the Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. China has quarantined more than 50 million people throughout the province. All transportation in and out of Wuhan has been halted.\n\nShramko is Canadian — she grew up in Vancouver, where she studied fashion marketing. She met her boyfriend, who lives in Wuhan, while on a month-long trip to the city. She moved there to be with him about eight months before the coronavirus outbreak began. When the city shut down, Shramko's boyfriend was on a business trip. The quarantine rules mean he can't return, so he's staying with family in a different province.\n\nThat has left Shramko alone with her ginger-colored cat, Kitya.\n\nWhen Canadian authorities started chartering flights to evacuate citizens, Shramko registered. But then she learned there was a strict no-pet policy on the plane. She wouldn't leave Kitya behind.\n\n\"I don't know when the epidemic will be over so it's kind of abandoning her in a way, even if I give her to a friend,\" Shramko told Business Insider.\n\nBut life under quarantine hasn't been easy.\n\n\"After a month of just being alone and not having that much human interaction, it really takes its toll mentally,\" Shramko said.\n\nLife in a ghost town\n\nThe grocery store across the street from Shramko's apartment was basically empty, she said. A few bags of noodles and some condiment packages remained on the shelves, but for the most part, they were bare. Still, the supermarket is the place Shramko has seen the most activity since Wuhan residents were quarantined, she said.\n\nThe supermarket that Shramko visits, during the quarantine. Kristina Shramko\n\n\"It's pretty much a ghost town outside,\" she said. \"I live directly across from a huge mall and this mall was always packed with people. Even the street to get into the mall's parking lot was always busy. Now, there are no cars at all and nobody outside.\"\n\nShramko, who is 21 years old, lives in Wuhan's Hanyang district. She said she's passing the time under quarantine by working on her YouTube channel. During the day, she films and edits videos or watches videos from other users.\n\n\"If I'm not working on videos, I'll watch a movie,\" she said. \"China has something similar to Netflix so I've been able to watch American movies here.\"\n\nShramko inside her loft. Kristina Shramko\n\nShe said she has also been reading books and playing with Kitya.\n\nThe person she talks to most often, she added, is her boyfriend, though friends are checking up on her from time to time. Shramko talks to her family almost every day, too.\n\n\"They update me on what they're hearing about the coronavirus in Canada and I let them know what's going on in China,\" she said.\n\nFor now, the Chinese government has offered to extend foreigner visas for those under lockdown.\n\nBut money is getting tight, she said.\n\n\"Nobody is working right now so there is no income,\" Shramko said. \"I'm trying to save as much money as possible since we don't know when all of this will be over.\"\n\nShe said she has heard rumors that the quarantine could last until April or May.\n\n'They are doing their best'\n\nShramko wasn't too concerned about the coronavirus at the start of the lockdown.\n\n\"In my mind, a super contagious and deadly virus just didn't seem real,\" she said. \"It seemed like something you only saw in movies. After a few weeks, it really kicked in that this was a serious matter.\"\n\nBut she added that some of the fear surrounding the outbreak is still over-dramatized.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many times people have messaged me on Twitter or Instagram in a panic, asking me to leave China right now, as if if I didn't leave, I would die,\" she said. \"If you are careful and take the necessary precautions, you'll be fine.\"\n\nA man crosses an empty highway road on February 3, 2020 in Wuhan. Getty Images\n\nShramko said she has been washing her hands constantly and trying not to leave the house unless it's absolutely necessary. When she does, she wears her mask. Toward the start of the outbreak, she said, her sinuses started acting up and she worried she might have contracted the virus, but the symptoms were short-lived.\n\nThe majority of coronavirus patients so far have been older men with preexisting health problems, according to a recent study of nearly 140 patients in Wuhan. Chinese authorities have reported that 80% of the cases in China are among those ages 60 and older, and the World Health Organization estimates that 14% of the reported cases in China are \"severe.\"\n\nShramko said she understands why the Chinese government has struggled to quash the outbreak.\n\n\"I can't say that I've put all my faith in the Chinese government, but I can say that they are doing their best,\" she said. \"It's a highly contagious virus, so it's hard to control.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean she wants to stay in Wuhan. Shramko said she's getting restless to return to Canada and wishes the government would allow her evacuate with Kitya.\n\n\"She's been there for me throughout this whole quarantine,\" Shramko said of her cat. \"I should be there for her, too.\"\n\nHave you been personally affected by the coronavirus epidemic?

            "content": "China’s aviation market, projected to overtake the U.S. this decade and become the world’s biggest, has shrunk to such an extent due to the coronavirus outbreak that it’s fallen from third to 25th, behind Portugal.\n\nAirlines have slashed capacity because of the epidemic centered in Hubei province, leaving the industry reeling. About 1.7 million seats — almost 80% of capacity — were dropped from China services from Jan. 20 to Feb. 17 by global carriers, according to OAG Aviation Worldwide. Meanwhile, Chinese airlines cut 10.4 million seats domestically.\n\n“No event that we remember has had such a devastating effect on capacity as coronavirus,” John Grant, senior analyst at OAG, wrote in a report. “In many ways it highlights the importance of the Chinese market to aviation and the rapid globalization of air services as new markets and travelers emerge.”\n\nMany airlines have suspended flights to China in an effort to contain the virus, which has killed nearly 1,900 people in the country and infected more than 72,000. The total number of seats from China to Hong Kong and Taiwan has dropped a quarter of a million in five weeks, while the country’s three main airlines slashed international capacity by between 80% and 90%, according to OAG.\n\nAfter the cuts, China Southern Airlines Co. operates only about 800 seats more on international services than Air Astana JSC of Kazakhstan, while China Eastern Airlines Corp. is just ahead of Tunis Air, Grant wrote. Both Chinese carriers reduced capacity by more than 200,000 seats a week because of the virus, according to OAG.\n\n“The damage to some airlines and the long term impact on their growth may linger beyond the virus,” Grant said.\n\n–With assistance from Matt Turner.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com."

REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics has launched smartphone delivery services for customers to test its new products, as the spread of the coronavirus has prompted the tech giant to cancel promotional events and brace for weak store sales.\n\nThe move highlights efforts made by the global smartphone industry, one of the tech sectors most hurt by the virus outbreak in China, to minimize the impact on business.\n\nAnalysts say the virus may slash demand for smartphones by half in the first quarter in China, the world’s biggest market for the devices.\n\nApple Inc warned on Monday it was unlikely to meet a sales target set just three weeks ago, while Xiaomi Corp had to livestream its smartphone launch event last week because of nationwide restrictions on travel and large gatherings.\n\nSamsung, which unveiled a new foldable smartphone and a trio of its flagship Galaxy S20 models last week, is also curtailing brick-and-mortar marketing.\n\nThe South Korean smartphone maker has decided to sharply cut the number of in-store “experimental zones,” where consumers can try out the latest phones, and skip promotional events such as “Galaxy fan parties” for the latest device over worries about the spread of the virus, dubbed SARS-Cov-2.\n\nThere will only be nine such zones for the Galaxy S20, compared with the 130 it had for Galaxy Note 10 series in South Korea, according to Samsung’s website.\n\nSamsung customers who want to try out the Galaxy S20 can have one delivered to their door and can use it for up to 24 hours. A delivery worker will pick it up after that, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\n“We are introducing a new service, as coronavirus-related issues could result in less in-store experience,” one of the people said, adding that the service is expected to be available only in some parts of South Korea."

That brings the overall count of confirmed infections in China to 72,531 and the number of deaths to 1,870.\n\nA new study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the National Health Commission, found that more than 80% of people who contracted the newly discovered virus -- known officially as COVID-19 -- had mild symptoms and recovered, while 14% of the cases studied included severe symptoms, like pneumonia and shortness of breath. About 5% of patients had critical symptoms, such as organ and respiratory failure and septic shock.\n\nThe study, which cited analyses of more than 44,000 cases of COVID-19, also found that a patient's risk of death increased with their age, and relatively few children contracted the disease.\n\nScientists need more research to understand why so few cases of the disease have been in children, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference Monday. And while the data indicates a decline in cases, Tedros cautioned that the trend should be \"interpreted very cautiously.\"\n\n\"It’s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue,\" he told reporters. \"Every scenario is still on the table.\"\n\nThis photo taken on Feb. 17, 2020, shows a man (L) who has displayed mild symptoms of the novel coronavirus using a laptop at an exhibition center converted into a hospital in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. Str/AFP via Getty Images\n\nCOVID-19 causes symptoms similar to pneumonia, ranging from mild, such as a slight cough, to more severe, including fever and difficulty breathing, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is no vaccine yet for the virus, nor any known effective therapeutics.\n\nOutside of China, there were 794 confirmed cases in 25 countries and three reported deaths as of Monday, according to the WHO, which would bring the global death toll to 1,873.\n\nMeanwhile, a cruise ship quarantined in Japanese waters continues to be the largest center of infection of anywhere outside China.\n\nThe Diamond Princess docked at the Japanese port of Yokohama on Feb. 3 and was placed under quarantine two days later, as passengers and crew tested positive for COVID-19. Since then, at least 542 people on board the cruise ship have been infected with the disease -- 88 of which were newly confirmed in the past 24 hours. At least one quarantine officer has also been infected, according to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, which is leading and coordinating the public health response on board.\n\nAll those infected with the disease on the Diamond Princess have been brought ashore for treatment, while thousands of other passengers have been confined to their rooms on board until the quarantine period ends.\n\nPeople still in quarantine due to fears of the new coronavirus stand on the deck of the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, Japan, on Feb. 18, 2020. Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe United States is the first country to evacuate its citizens from the quarantined ship in Japan. More than 300 American passengers, including 14 who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, were evacuated Monday on two flights chartered by the U.S. government, officials said. Roughly 60 Americans, some who were hospitalized and others who opted to stay on the ship, remain in Japan.\n\nThe first charter flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California early Monday morning. The second landed soon after at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Everyone on board the flights will be quarantined for 14 days. Several individuals, including some who tested positive for the virus, were transferred to hospitals, officials said.\n\nPrincess Cruises, which operates the ship, announced in a statement Sunday that it will cancel all Diamond Princess voyages through April 20 due to the \"prolonged quarantine period.\" The cruise line is offering a full refund to all 2,666 guests who were on board the ship. More than 400 passengers were from the United States.\n\nThe initial cases of COVID-19 emerged in December in Wuhan, the capital of China's central Hubei province. Chinese authorities have placed the city on lockdown in an effort to contain the virus.\n\nThe WHO has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, with a \"very\" high risk of spread within China and a \"high\" risk of spread at the global and regional levels.\n\nPeople wear face masks and plastic raincoats as a protection from coronavirus at Shanghai railway station, in Shanghai, China, Feb. 17, 2020. Aly Song/Reuters\n\nThe Health Commission of Hubei Province announced last Thursday a change in how cases are diagnosed and counted, with the total number of confirmed cases now including \"clinically diagnosed cases,\" or patients who showed symptoms of the disease and were diagnosed through CT scans of the lungs, for instance, but have not yet had laboratory testing.\n\nThe expanded criteria is meant to ensure \"that patients can receive standardized treatment according to confirmed cases as early as possible to further improve the success rate of treatment,\" the commission said in a statement.\n\nABC News' Joseph Simonetti contributed to this report.\n\nThis report was featured in the Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2020, episode of “Start Here,” ABC News’ daily news podcast.\n\n\"Start Here\" offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

The latest revelation comes as a U.S. health official said at least 40 Americans on a cruise ship in Japan are infected with the deadly new virus.\n\nThe timeline is part of a speech Xi gave to party leaders Feb. 3 that was published over the weekend in state media. Xi outlined the government response to the COVID-19 outbreak that he warned could jeopardize health as well as economic and social stability.\n\n“I issued demands during a Politburo Standing Committee meeting on Jan. 7 for work to contain the outbreak,\" Xi said in the speech. \"On Jan. 20, I gave special instructions about the work to prevent and control the outbreak.\"\n\nWithin days, Xi began ordering entire cities shut down to slow the outbreak. Several cities and about 60 million people remained essentially under quarantine Sunday, and some of those lockdowns were tightened. The government of Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, locked down all residential communities in urban and rural areas, closed non-essential public places and banned public gatherings and the use of private vehicles.\n\nXi and the Hubei leadership have come under intense scrutiny in China. Last week, top provincial leaders were ousted for failing to take aggressive actions Xi called for in January. More local officials were disciplined Sunday.\n\nSen Ben Sasse: Xi's malfeasance and misrule fueled the crisis\n\nThe crisis deepened for Xi last week following the death of ophthalmologist Li Wenliang in Wuhan, the sprawling city of 11 million people that serves as the capital of Hubei Province.\n\nLi had become a national hero for alerting fellow physicians Dec. 30 in an online post about the emergence of a SARS-like illness, warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection. Li was detained by local security police on charges of spreading rumors and forced to sign a document disavowing his statements.\n\nWriting on the Chinese social media site Weibo, Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, called Li \"immortal\" and a \"hero.\"\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, has been a supporter of China's efforts. International experts participating in a WHO-led joint mission arrived in Beijing on Sunday and were soon to meet with their Chinese counterparts, he said.\n\n“China has bought the world time. We don’t know how much time,” he said. “We’re encouraged that outside China, we have not yet seen widespread community transmission.”\n\nOn Sunday, global death toll rose to 1,770 while the total confirmed cases reached 71,200. All but five of the deaths took place in mainland China, where more than 70,000 of the cases have been confirmed. Fifteen cases but no deaths have been reported in the U.S.\n\nIn Japan, some of the 380 Americans aboard a quarantined cruise ship were being flown to the U.S. but will face another two-week quarantine, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said.\n\n\"We continue to collaborate closely with Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control, the Government of Japan and Carnival Cruise Lines on all aspects of this dynamic situation,\" the embassy said in a letter to passengers.\n\nAlmost 300 people aboard the Diamond Princess, docked at Yokohama, have tested positive for the virus. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CBS News that about 40 Americans are among those infected. Those showing symptoms won't be allowed on the plane, he said.\n\n“If people on the plane start to develop symptoms, they’ll be segregated within the plane,” Fauci said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press"

During the period Japanese consumer spending fell 2.9% after the country's sales tax was raised in October to 10% from 8%. In the same month Typhoon Hagibis hit large parts of the country. Last quarter, capital spending dropped by 3.7% and exports slipped 0.1% amid the ongoing US-China trade war. Investors are now watching to see whether the economy will rebound after the coronavirus forced China to shut down factories and led to a big drop in Chinese tourists visiting Japan.\n\nHow about a little realism here?\n\nThe Japanese economy shrank 6.3% annualized even before the coronavirus impact.\n\nReuters reports Coronavirus cases rise again in China as recession looms for Japan, Singapore.\n\nThe number of reported new cases of coronavirus in China’s Hubei province rose on Monday after two days of falls, as authorities imposed tough new restrictions on movement to prevent the spread of the disease which has now killed more than 1,700 people. With no end in sight for the outbreak, Japan and Singapore appeared to be on the brink of recession with data on Monday pointing to possible contractions in the current quarter. Across China many factories remain closed following the extended Lunar New Year holiday, disrupting supply chains around the world. Virus-related damage to Japan’s economy is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession in the world’s third-largest economy.\n\nFears of recession, or already in recession?\n\nThe New York Times reports Japan’s Economy Shrank Sharply. Now Comes the Coronavirus.\n\nAfter hits from storms and a tax increase, the world’s No. 3 economy could face recession as the outbreak takes a toll on tourism. Japan’s economy has already been staggered by a devastating typhoon and a wallet-shutting tax increase. Now, the coronavirus that has brought business in neighboring China to a virtual standstill threatens to knock Japan into a full-blown recession. If Japan’s economy — the world’s third largest after the United States and China — shrinks again in the first quarter of 2020, the country will officially fall into recession for the first time since a brief dip in 2015. A recession is generally defined as two straight quarterly contractions.\n\nI will come back to that definition in just a bit but it is not a good definition nor is it accurate.\n\nThird Fatal Mistake\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Japan’s Third Sales-Tax Blunder Must Be Its Final Mistake.\n\nJapan’s economy shrank sharply in the final three months of 2019, logging its second-worst quarter in the past decade. That would be easier to stomach if it weren’t because of a mistake policy makers have now made three times. In October, Japan raised its sales tax to 10% from 8%—and spending tanked. Household consumption fell 11.5% on an annualized basis in the October-December quarter, fueling a 6.3% fall in annualized gross domestic product. Sales-tax increases in 1997 and 2014 likewise knocked the economy off course. The three worst quarters for household consumption in the past quarter-century were those in which sales tax was raised.\n\nBrad Setser on Japan's Mistake\n\nMichael Pettis On Japan's Mistake\n\nWork at Home\n\nGreat Recession Flashback\n\nIn the early months of 2008, many observers believed that a U.S. recession had begun. The collapse of Bear Stearns and the resulting financial market turbulence signaled that the crisis would not be mild and brief. The former head of the National Bureau of Economic Research [NBER] said in March 2008 that he believed the country was then in a recession, and it could be a severe one. According to numbers published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in May 2008, the GDP growth of the previous two quarters was positive. As one common definition of a recession is negative economic growth for at least two consecutive fiscal quarters, some analysts suggested this indicates that the U.S. economy was not in a recession at the time. However, this estimate has been disputed by analysts who argue that if inflation is taken into account, the GDP growth was negative for those two quarters, making it a technical recession. In a May 9, 2008 report, the chief North American economist for investment bank Merrill Lynch wrote that despite the GDP growth reported for the first quarter of 2008, \"it is still reasonable to believe that the recession started some time between September and January\", on the grounds that the National Bureau of Economic Research's four recession indicators all peaked during that period. In March 2008, financier Warren Buffett stated in a CNBC interview that by a \"common sense definition\", the U.S. economy was already in a recession.\n\nThe above from Wikipedia Great Recession in the United States.\n\nReal Gross Domestic Product\n\nThe NBER is the official arbiter of US recessions. The NBER pegged the Great Recession start as December of 2007.\n\nHowever, the above chart shows that US economy grew in the fourth quarter of 2007 and second quarter of 2008.\n\nThere were not two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. There was not even one!\n\nTwo consecutive quarters of negative GDP is a sufficient condition but not a necessary condition of a recession.\n\nEconomic writers constantly struggle with this construct.\n\nCommon Sense\n\nNote to economic writers: Please refresh yourself on the difference between necessary and sufficient.\n\nWith the Japanese economy collapsing at at a 6.3% annualized rate in October-December and with a coronavirus tourist collapse in the first quarter, by any common sense measure Japan is already in the midst of a severe recession.\n\nAnd forget any talk of \"technical\" recession, this one rates to be severe. The coronavirus is certain to amplify a very poor sales tax hike policy decision.\n\nMike \"Mish\" Shedlock"

            "content": "(CNN) Concerns are mounting about how long the novel coronavirus may survive on surfaces -- so much so that China's central bank has taken measures to deep clean and destroy its cash , which changes hands multiple times a day, in an effort to contain the virus.\n\nIt is unknown exactly how long the novel coronavirus can linger on contaminated surfaces and objects with the potential of infecting people, but some researchers are finding clues by studying the elusive behaviors of other coronaviruses.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nOfficials do not know what animal may have caused the current outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. But previously, studies have suggested that people were infected with the coronavirus MERS , or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, after coming in contact with camels, and scientists have suspected that civet cats were to blame for SARS , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.\n\nThese human coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, have been found to persist on inanimate surfaces -- including metal, glass or plastic surfaces -- for as long as nine days if that surface had not been disinfected, according to research published earlier this month in The Journal of Hospital Infection\n\nCleaning with common household products can make a difference, according to the research, which also found that human coronaviruses \"can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite\" or bleach within one minute.\n\nThe new research involved analyzing 22 previously published studies on coronaviruses, which researchers hope can help provide insight into the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"Based on the current available data, I would primarily rely on the data from SARS coronavirus, which is the closest relative to the novel coronavirus -- with 80% sequence similarity -- among the coronaviruses tested. For SARS coronavirus, the range of persistence on surfaces was less than five minutes to nine days,\" said Dr. Charles Chiu, an infectious disease professor at the University of California, San Francisco , and director of the USCF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\"However, it is very difficult to extrapolate these findings to the novel coronavirus due to the different strains, viral titers and environmental conditions that were tested in the various studies and the lack of data on the novel coronavirus itself,\" he said. \"More research using cultures of the novel coronavirus are needed to establish the duration that it can survive on surfaces.\"\n\n\"It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,\" according to the CDC's website\n\nWhile there are some similarities between other coronaviruses and the novel coronavirus, there are some differences emerging, too.\n\nJUST WATCHED How does coronavirus spread? Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How does coronavirus spread? Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains. 01:33\n\n\"It also appears that COVID-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said during a media briefing with reporters Monday.\n\n\"More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover. In about 14% of cases, the virus causes severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath. And about 5% of patients have critical diseases including respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorgan failure,\" he said. \"In 2% of reported cases, the virus is fatal, and the risk of death increases the older you are. We see relatively few cases among children. More research is needed to understand why.\"\n\nWhile the novel coronavirus fatality rate is lower than for SARS and MERS, it still seems to be comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, said in January\n\n\"It is a significant concern, globally,\" Ferguson said, noting that we don't yet fully understand the severity.\n\nFerguson said he believes the fatality rate is likely to be lower because of an \"iceberg\" of milder cases that have not yet been identified, but he highlights that novel viruses spread much more quickly through a population.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Remain informed, but do not panic,\" Chiu said.\n\nIf you do have concerns, \"my recommendations would be frequent hand-washing, avoiding contact with people who are sick, follow home quarantine recommendations according to the latest public health agency guidelines if you have recently traveled from China or were in contact with a known or suspected infected patient,\" he said.\n\nBut overall, \"it is still far more likely that you contract influenza rather than this novel coronavirus, meaning that you should get vaccinated for influenza as well.\""

            "content": "China released a speech showing President Xi Jinping was leading the national effort to contain the coronavirus almost two weeks before he first issued public orders on the outbreak, potentially exposing him to more criticism as anger mounts over the government’s initial response.\n\nIn the Feb. 3 speech, Xi told China’s most powerful leaders that he had “continuously given verbal and written instructions” since Jan. 7, and had personally ordered the quarantine of about 60 million people in Hubei province later that month. The full speech appeared on the website of the Qiushi Journal, the Communist Party’s top publication, on Saturday.\n\nState media reports on Jan. 7 didn’t include any remarks from Xi on the virus, a fact that was quickly pointed out by Chinese social media users. Xi publicly addressed the crisis for the first time on Jan. 20 in a directive urging party committees and governments at all levels to take measures to curb the spread of the epidemic.\n\n“From the first day of Chinese New Year to the present, prevention and control of the epidemic situation was the issue I have been most concerned with,” Xi said, referring to a meeting of China’s seven most powerful leaders he chaired on Jan. 25. “I have been keeping track of the spread of the epidemic situation and the progress of the prevention and control work, and continuously given verbal and written instructions.”\n\nQiushi also separately published a timeline starting on Jan. 7 of Xi’s involvement in the work to stop the epidemic. The World Health Organization said China had informed the agency on Dec. 31 of a cluster of “pneumonia of unknown cause” detected in Wuhan.\n\nThe decision to publish the speech appeared to be an attempt to answer criticism that Xi had pulled back from public view as the outbreak worsened, though the revelation that he was in charge from the beginning could also place the blame for any fallout more squarely on his shoulders.\n\n“It’s clear he’s trying to allay concerns that Beijing did not glimpse the full scale of the epidemic, but Xi has now raised more questions than he’s answered,” said Jude Blanchette, Freeman chair of China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The sluggish response by China’s political system to the virus is a significant rebuke to Xi’s theory of governance.”\n\nGet The Brief.

It was the first time Xi interacted with the public since a trip to Yunnan province from Jan. 19 to Jan. 21.\n\nThe epidemic has claimed more than 1,600 lives in China, with over 68,000 confirmed infections.\n\nXi has become China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong in his eight years running the country, engineering constitutional changes to make himself the “core” of the Communist Party and scrapping presidential term limits. The virus outbreak has revealed the risks involved with that strategy, with analysts warning that if the epidemic gets worse and the economic pain is deeper than expected, Xi will bear the blame.\n\n“This would hurt his own credibility,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Centre for China Studies. “The Chinese were not made aware of the true picture early enough,” he said, adding that internal communication within the Communist Party “wasn’t useful unless made public.”\n\nThe speech also unveiled for the first time that Xi was behind the aggressive measure to quarantine millions in Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\n“I explicitly demanded Hubei province implement comprehensive and strict controls on the outflow of personnel on Jan. 22,” Xi said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com."

            "content": "The case for global health diplomacy\n\nOne of the hallmarks of an effective foreign policy is that it runs in the background, neither loud nor especially visible. Governments must urgently adopt such an approach to stem the growing global panic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, which has now killed more than 1,700 people and infected in excess of 71,000.\n\nAlthough almost all the deaths and confirmed cases to date have been in mainland China, the virus has spread to more than two dozen countries. The World Health Organization recently declared the outbreak to be a global health emergency.\n\nFor the time being, panic reigns. Global technology firms such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Tesla have temporarily suspended their operations in China and asked their employees to work from home. Many foreign airlines, carmakers, retail and entertainment chains, and financial institutions have taken similar measures. And in the United States, Asian-Americans and students from Asian countries are facing a surge in xenophobic comments about their food, culture, and way of life.\n\nIn addition, many countries have joined the US in temporarily refusing entry to foreign nationals who have recently traveled within China. However, prominent global health experts argue that restrictive policies such as these, which usually are reserved for life-threatening situations, are unlikely to stop the spread of what the WHO has now christened Covid-19.\n\nInstead, such measures have fueled panic among investors. Most Chinese stocks fell sharply when trading resumed after the country’s New Year holiday, with some market indices suffering their biggest single-day declines in more than a decade. Because China is the world’s second-largest economy, these financial losses will have a global impact. Furthermore, Covid-19’s disruptive impact on labor markets, travel, and factory production will hurt the operations of global firms that depend on China’s manufacturing strength and supply chains.\n\nThe crisis is a reminder of why governments must regard health as an essential component of foreign policy. Indeed, much of the current panic could have been prevented had political leaders pursued global health diplomacy.\n\nGovernments have previously recognized the role of health as a crucial foreign-policy tool, including in the 2007 Oslo Ministerial Declaration by the foreign ministers of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand. But applying this idea has become increasingly difficult because of the global rise of far-right nationalism, which presents diplomats with the challenge of maintaining amicable relations with allies demonized by their own governments.\n\nImpulsive foreign policies aimed at tackling Covid-19 – such as travel bans and the suspension of economic activities – are not only unsupported by scientific evidence, but also are likely to prove harmful in the long run. By contrast, soft power, or a country’s ability to shape the preferences of others through persuasion and diplomacy, often is much more effective.\n\nIn fact, three of the strategies likely to prove most effective in tackling Covid-19 (and future epidemics) will require governments and other actors to cooperate more closely, establish deep mutual trust, and develop platforms that promote the free dissemination of evidence-based scientific data.\n\nFor starters, health should be considered a global public good. Countries with robust systems for collecting and disseminating scientific research should establish collaborative networks through which low- and middle-income countries can report and publish information on infectious outbreaks. Fortunately, leading international medical journals, including The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine, are collecting – and rapidly publishing – evidence-based, peer-reviewed data on Covid-19’s clinical and public-health characteristics.\n\nThis is critical, because the new coronavirus has not been the only epidemic to spread globally in recent weeks; there also is an epidemic of misinformation online, especially on social media platforms.\n\nSecond, countries where potential outbreaks originate should not be made to feel stigmatized. Governments need to create formal, confidential channels through which officials can freely share information on emerging health risks or potential outbreaks. COVID-19 has spread so widely in part because the Chinese government feared political embarrassment and initially suppressed information when doctors in Wuhan raised the alarm over infectious cases.\n\nAlthough countries have varying mechanisms for informing the public about health-related risks, more coordinated global health diplomacy could have mitigated the epidemic’s impact.\n\nThird, governments should invest in building data-management systems that can track the spread of epidemics, preferably in real-time. These could resemble the innovative dashboard map created by Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering to track the Covid-19 outbreak. This map compiles data from the WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its European and Chinese counterparts, and China’s National Health Commission – all in real-time. Such data is vital in helping governments to make informed decisions about how best to tackle the virus.\n\nIn a globalized world, we cannot afford to ignore health risks arising in other countries. Rich-country governments, in particular, should therefore not regard increased globalization and interdependence as purely economic phenomena that enable firms to establish manufacturing and supply-chain operations in middle- and lower-income economies. Privileged countries also have a responsibility to establish support mechanisms that help others address emerging health threats.\n\nFaced with a global epidemic such as Covid-19, political leaders should be guided by scientific evidence and compassion, not anecdotes and xenophobia. Enlightened global health diplomacy could save countless lives.\n\nCopyright: Project Syndicate\n\n– Contact us at [email protected]\n\nCG"

Photo : Carl Court ( Getty Images )\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. flew in more than 300 Americans after they spent almost two weeks stuck on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had seen hundreds of its passengers test positive for COVID-19, the official name for the coronavirus. However, among the people that came back to the U.S. were 14 passengers that tested positive for the coronavirus, an unexpected turn of events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe passengers’ arrival pra ctically doubles the cases of confirmed coronavirus in the U.S., from 15 to 29. The infected individuals, who are not showing symptoms of the coronavirus such as sore throats or coughing, are being treated and monitored at the University of Nebraska in Omaha and at hospitals near the Travis Air Force Base in California, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAmericans who were repatriated to the U.S. and tested negative will have to wait in quarantine for two weeks, which is the believed incubation period for the virus.\n\nOriginally, the U.S. said that no cruise passengers that tested positive for the virus would be allowed on the flights back to the country. Nonetheless, the government’s plans were compromised when it was informed on the way to the airport that 14 of the more than 300 passengers it was transporting had tested positive for the virus.\n\nPassengers had been tested for the virus by Japanese experts two or three days before the scheduled repatriation. Per the New York Times, U.S. medical experts examined passengers on the cruise ship and determined that at least 328 could be evacuated. At that time, the U.S. did not have the test results for all of the passengers it planned to take back to the country. However, it continued with the repatriation because it determined that it did not know when the results would come in, specifically saying that it was “unpredictable.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of Monday, the Japanese government announced that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship had risen to 454.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a last-minute decision, the U.S. decided to take the 14 infected passengers back hom e. Authorities se parated them from the other passengers on the plane and isolated them. In a joint statement released by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the government said that medical professionals closely monitored all passengers on the flight.\n\n“Every precaution to ensure proper isolation and community protection measures are being taken, driven by the most up-to-date risk assessments by U.S. health authorities,” the departments said. “We continue all possible efforts to protect the welfare of U.S. citizens.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reported that at least 55 Americans on the ship had coronavirus. Many of them are being treated in hospitals in Japan.\n\nIn its Feb. 17 Situation Report, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there were 71,429 global cases of coronavirus, 70,635 of which were in China. There have been 1,775 deaths."

The hospital, one of the seven designated for the epidemic in Wuhan, treated thousands of people each day.\n\nLiu, 51, was a leading figure in neurosurgery, the newspaper said. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said Liu made “important contributions in the work of fighting and controlling” the virus, known as COVID-19.\n\n\"Unfortunately he became infected and passed away at 10:54 Tuesday morning after all-out efforts to save him failed,” the commission said.\n\nHis death was one of 98 on Tuesday attributed to the virus, pushing the global death toll to 1,875, including 1,789 in Hubei. All but a handful of global, virus-related deaths have occurred in mainland China.\n\nTotal infections rose Tuesday to more than 73,000, all but a few hundred in mainland China.\n\nCoronavirus, explained:Everything to know about Covid-19, the deadly virus alarming the world\n\nStudy: Virus far more deadly than flu\n\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention put the overall death rate of the COVID-19 virus at 2.3%, compared to the season's flu death rate of 0.1%.\n\nStill, the coronavirus death rate is far below that of severe acute respiratory syndrome – SARS – which swept across China almost two decades ago. SARS death rate was almost 10%, although less than 10,000 SARS cases were ever confirmed.\n\nThe Chinese study also found that more than 80% of the cases have been mild, with the sick and elderly most at risk. The report suggests the outbreak peaked in late January.\n\nLauren Gardner, a Johns Hopkins University civil engineering professor who spearheaded a mapping website for the coronavirus, says it's too early in the outbreak to estimate mortality rates. The death rate is likely \"much lower\" than current estimates, she said.\n\n\"We don’t know how many actually cases exist,\" she said. \"Our reporting to date is biased by the severe cases that actual seek medical attention, but there are likely many mild cases that are not reported because these individuals don’t seek medical care.\"\n\nWhy did US break Diamond Princess quarantine? 'Something went awry'\n\nCruise ship cases exceed 500\n\nCoronavirus continued to sweep through the quarantined Princess Cruises' ship, Diamond Princess, docked and quarantined at the port in Yokohama, Japan. As of Tuesday, 542 cases of the virus have been identified among the 3,711 passengers and crew. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, says the quarantine effort on the ship \"failed.\"\n\nFrom rumor to 1,500 deaths:How coronavirus outbreak unfolded for Americans at ground zero\n\nContributing: Ryan Miller and Julia Thompson, USA TODAY; The Associated Press"

Suppliers like Quanta have moved volume production to facilities in Taiwan to meet client needs, but a component shortage is believed to continue to affect shipment numbers. This shortage is due to suppliers who are prevented from going to work following the outbreak.This component shortage is predicted to cause disruptions to the supply chain in March. Meanwhile, Quanta is said to be moving to accelerate volume production at its new facilities in Taiwan in order to fulfill rush shipments to its clients in the United States.Previously, global notebook shipments were predicted to fall about 17 percent in Q1 2020, but that number has been increased to between 29 and 36 percent as of DigiTimes' latest research. \"Severe labor and components shortages and stagnant logistics arising from the coronavirus outbreak are derailing supply chain in China, which commands over 90% of global notebook production.\""

            "content": "In not following America’s lead, these allies have set precedents for how countries caught between the superpowers could act in the future. They have also signaled that international relations today are too intertwined, and Chinese power too magnetic, for them to enlist in a U.S.-led coalition and usher in a Cold War–style bifurcated world. If the United States is intent on reconstructing that world, it will likely find itself largely isolated. If the United States wishes to not be isolated, it will have to develop compelling alternatives for allies to stick with it instead of China.\n\nThe countermovement against a U.S.-China cold war gained strength in late January, when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the United Kingdom would allow the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to provide equipment for Britain’s next-generation 5G mobile network.\n\nThis was a slap in the face to the U.S. officials who had spent months lobbying their British counterparts to ban Huawei because of alleged security risks associated with its connections to the Chinese government. The Trump administration reportedly went so far as to share classified intelligence with the United Kingdom indicating that Huawei could potentially spy on and disrupt foreign networks—a claim Huawei denies.\n\nUltimately, the U.K. chose to split the difference between China and the United States. The British government said it would keep Huawei technology out of the most sensitive parts of the country’s new 5G network, but it won’t follow the United States, Australia, and Japan in outright prohibiting the provider.\n\nRead: Britain and America have a China problem\n\nBut the fact that the U.K., which famously enjoys a “special relationship” with the United States, went with that option—with intelligence sharing and trade talks with Washington on the line after Brexit, no less—emboldened other allies. The European Union and France swiftly disclosed similar plans, and Germany looks poised to do the same. Other conflicted allies, such as India and South Korea, are undoubtedly watching the cascade.\n\nFor these countries, the benefits of partnering with Huawei—the dominant player in the global 5G market, and also the cheapest because of Chinese government subsidies—are obvious while the costs are more opaque, if no less real. As Johnson put it, “If people oppose one brand or another then they have to tell us what is the alternative, right?”\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr has recognized this weakness in America’s message to allies, proposing that the U.S. government quickly offer a “market-ready alternative” to Huawei by taking a controlling ownership stake in Huawei’s European competitors Nokia or Ericsson.\n\nReihan Salam: The age of ‘Chimerica’ is coming to an end\n\nBut Barr also acknowledged that the Trump administration’s grievances with Huawei are about more than security risks—amounting to a battle over which superpower will dominate the backbone of the future digital economy, with trillions of dollars in new opportunities in play. This is true, but it’s also an admission that is likely to strengthen allies’ suspicions that the United States’ position is really about maintaining America’s technological leadership, not securing partners."

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nThe 19-country euro zone has for years stuck to a broadly neutral fiscal policy in its annual recommendations, despite repeated calls from the European Central Bank and slow-growth states for it to invest more.\n\nBut weak growth last year in Germany, the bloc’s largest economy, and fears of a new downturn fueled by the coronavirus outbreak in China are pushing Berlin to soften its stance.\n\n“While some ... risks (to growth) have receded slightly, including in the case of Brexit and trade tensions, the recent outbreak of coronavirus is a reason for concern and one which we will need to monitor closely,” the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Mario Centeno told a news conference.\n\n“The slowdown is still with us and we have agreed to coordinate any need for further policy response,” he said.\n\nUntil now, Germany has preached austerity to reduce fiscal imbalances in high-debt countries, like Italy and Greece.\n\n“If downside risks were to materialize, fiscal responses should be differentiated, aiming for a more supportive stance at the aggregate level,” said the document the finance ministers discussed, which is to be published on Tuesday, confirming a Reuters report.\n\nChina’s coronavirus outbreak is among the main downside risks facing the euro zone economy, according to forecasts released last week by the European Commission.\n\nItalian Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri said it was too early to gauge the economic impact of the coronavirus, but that regardless, the last quarter of 2019 confirmed the need for “supportive fiscal policy” at the euro zone level.\n\nIn the last three months of the year, the German economy stagnated due to weaker private consumption and state spending, renewing fears of a recession.\n\nThe EU document said higher public spending would have to comply with EU fiscal rules which limit deficits to 3% of gross domestic product, among other requirements.\n\nBut the ultimate decision on whether countries that have strong public finances will spend more as per the euro zone recommendation, lies entirely with their national governments. Germany and the Netherlands, which have enjoyed budget surpluses for years, plan some additional outlays, but not as much as some in the euro zone are calling for.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said Germany would spend more during an economic crisis, but despite last year’s slowdown it has posted large budget surpluses in the first nine months, Eurostat figures released in January showed."

            "content": "In the final weeks of 2019, a virus slipped furtively from animal to human somewhere in the Chinese city of Wuhan. This inauspicious moment marked the sounding of a starting pistol, unheard at first but now echoing deafeningly across the globe. The race to stop a pandemic had begun.\n\nWe have been trying to keep up with the novel coronavirus ever since. Each day, we are faced with worrying headlines reporting the latest twists and turns of this outbreak. We have seen the virus spill over China’s borders and spread to at least 25 countries worldwide, and watched with mounting anxiety as the number of cases creeps ever higher. We wait apprehensively to see where the virus shows up next.\n\nAt the time of writing, there have been 43,036 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and the death toll stands at 1,018. Both of these numbers will be out of date by the time you read this.\n\nIn isolation, the daily headlines can be difficult to interpret, offering a static snapshot of a moving target. It is hard, for instance, to tell if the situation is getting better or worse, and to what extent control efforts are having any effect.\n\nTo provide a clearer picture of this evolving story, at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, we have developed a new outbreak mapping tool.\n\nThe site is updated daily based on figures published by the World Health Organization (WHO). While other live trackers developed by Johns Hopkins University and the WHO are updated more frequently, our tool enables users to wind back the clock and view the global situation on any given day of the coronavirus outbreak. It also enables the unfolding situation to be compared with other recent outbreaks, including the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003 (also caused by a coronavirus), the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nProviding context\n\nOur hope is that this tool will provide more context to the daily headlines and a fresh perspective on key turning points in the disease’s history. For instance, by tracing the course of the outbreak, it is clear that the last week of January was pivotal for the international spread of the virus. In the space of a few days, the number of affected countries increased from seven to 20, while the number of confirmed cases outside China increased almost tenfold (from 11 to 106).\n\nOn the other hand, confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported in just four new countries since the start of February – a testament to the rapid, coordinated international response to this new threat. One can only hope that things stay this way, though mounting evidence that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms is worrying.\n\nThe situation in China is clearly rather different. Not only has the country seen more than 99% of the confirmed infections, but the total number of cases doubled every three to four days throughout January. Yet there is room for optimism – while caution must be taken when attempting to anticipate the future trajectory of this virus, recent predictions from mathematical modelers at our university suggest that the outbreak could peak in mid to late February if current trends continue.\n\nComparisons with other recent outbreaks are also revealing. At one end of the spectrum, the 2014 Ebola epidemic can be distinguished by its devastating virulence (killing nearly 40% of the 28,600 people infected) but narrow geographic range (the virus was largely confined to three countries in West Africa). On the other hand, the 2009 swine flu pandemic was far less virulent (with an estimated mortality rate of less than 0.1%), but reached every corner of the globe. All in all, swine flu is thought to have infected more than 60 million people, causing somewhere between 123,000 and 203,000 deaths.\n\nThe 2003 Sars outbreak.\n\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak currently sits somewhere between these two extremes. Its geographic distribution is most similar to that of Sars, with China at the epicenter and smaller clusters cropping up across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. While the mortality rate of the novel coronavirus (currently estimated at 2%) is well below that of Sars (10%), it already far outstrips the 8,096 confirmed cases of Sars, and the death toll of the novel coronavirus recently surpassed that of Sars.\n\nThe critical question now is whether the situation will turn into a full-blown pandemic. The novel coronavirus virus is clearly adept at passing from person to person, but outside of China, it has yet to ignite. We must do everything in our power to keep it that way.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation by Edward Parker, Research Fellow in Systems Biology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine under a Creative Commons license.

He was the first hospital director to die from the virus, and it is not known if he had suffered from any underlying conditions to increase his risk.\n\nNot much is yet known about Dr Liu's personal life, but he has been hailed by many on Chinese social media as a hero.\n\n\"Farewell to this hero, a soldier in white,\" said one comment on Weibo.\n\n\"There are no illnesses in heaven, thank you for your sacrifice,\" another said.\n\nThe whistle-blowing doctor: Li Wenliang\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dr Li's death triggered an outpouring of grief and rage against the government\n\nDr Li is arguably the most prominent figure to have died.\n\nIn December, he had been told by police officers not to spread \"fake rumours\" after alerting his friends to a new emerging virus. His death, much like Dr Liu's, was confusingly reportedly.\n\nOn 6 February, media outlets reported that he was dead, then later retracted it, saying that doctors were working to save him. They confirmed his death a day later.\n\nMillions have mourned Dr Li, and his death sparked a wave of anger, grief and overwhelming sense of mistrust towards the government.\n\nMany were furious that the government had tried to stifle his earlier warnings about the virus and accused them of also trying to cover up his death.\n\nThe film director: Chang Kai\n\nChang Kai, a director at Hubei Film Studios, died from the virus along with his father, mother and sister.\n\nA note, reportedly written by him and passed around by a friend, revealed the ordeal the 55-year-old had to go through before his death.\n\nAccording to the note, which was published in full by news site Caixin, his father had come down with a fever, cough and had difficulty breathing.\n\n\"He was taken to many hospitals for treatment, but [was] told no beds [were] available,\" said the note. \"[We were] extremely disappointed... [and] went home.\"\n\nA few days later his father died, followed afterwards by his mother, who was \"physically and mentally exhausted\".\n\n\"The ruthless virus also devoured my wife and my body. I went to various hospitals and begged [to be admitted]. Beds were hard to find... we are nobody,\" he said in his note. \"We missed the opportunity for healing and my breath was weak.\"\n\nChang Kai and his wife were later admitted to hospital, but according to local reports, his condition had deteriorated too much.\n\nHe died on 14 February, with his wife still battling the illness. He leaves behind a son, who is reportedly studying in the UK.\n\nSome of his last words in his note were: \"I [was] a filial child to my father and a responsible father to my son. A beloved husband to my wife and a sincere man in [this] life. To those I love and those who love me - farewell.\"\n\nThe painter: Liu Shouxiang\n\nImage copyright Weibo Image caption Prof Liu was known for his distinct watercolour style\n\nProf Liu Shouxiang was a renowned artist in Hubei, known for his watercolour paintings.\n\nAccording to news site Jiemian News, he died on 13 February aged 62.\n\nMr Liu was born in Wuhan in 1958. He went on to train at the Hubei Academy of Fine Arts, where he stayed on to teach, eventually become a professor.\n\nHe eventually became known for his distinct watercolour style, reported Jiemian News. His works have been displayed in some of the biggest art museums and galleries in the country.\n\nHis death was mourned by many on social media site Weibo, with one saying it was the death of a great \"talent\".\n\n\"It takes decades to train a talent and only a few days to end that life,\" said one comment.\n\n\"How many talents have been taken away by this virus?\" another asked. \"The financial cost of the virus is great but can the value of these people ever be measured?\"\n\nThe scientist: Duan Zhengcheng\n\nThe 86-year-old was a former academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a chief scientist at the National Engineering Research Centre for Digital Manufacturing.\n\nBorn in 1934 in Jiangsu, he went on to graduate with a degree from the China Central University of Science and Technology and later stayed on to teach.\n\nAccording to news site The Global Times, he went on to develop the world's first whole body gamma knife in 1996 - a type of radiation therapy used to treat tumours. This earned him a national award in 2005.\n\nHe was known by his students as the \"medical madman\" because he never gave up on anything, said the report.\n\nProf Duan died on 15 February.\n\nThe bodybuilder: Qiu Jun\n\nImage copyright Weibo Image caption The 72-year-old was known to visit the gym religiously\n\nQiu Jun from Wuhan was thrust into the spotlight last year when pictures showing the 72-year-old bodybuilding started to go viral.\n\nAccording to Phoenix News, he only began working out after his retirement, joining a gym and eventually going on to coach others and participating in bodybuilding competitions.\n\nHe was known to visit the gym religiously and had plans to compete in another bodybuilding competition later this June.\n\nHe started showing symptoms on 23 January and was eventually admitted to hospital after testing positive.\n\nBut he died days later on 6 February. His son reportedly sent this message to friends and family, informing them of his father's death: \"The father who never got sick could not escape the disaster.\""

In speeches there, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described Huawei and other tech companies backed by China as \"Trojan horses for Chinese intelligence\" and Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Beijing is carrying out a \"nefarious strategy\" via Huauei, according to CNBC.\n\nChina Foreign Minister Wang Yi shot back at the conference, reportedly saying US criticisms of Beijing were \"lies\" not based on facts.\n\n\"The root cause of all these problems and issues is that the US does not want to see rapid development and rejuvenation of China, still less would they want to accept the success of a socialist country, but that is not fair, China has the right to develop,\" Wang said, according to another CNBC report.\n\nThe US last year banned the use of Huawei's networking equipment, citing fears that close links between the company and the Chinese government could mean the company poses a spying risk, something Huawei has always vehemently denied.\n\nJust this week we learned that the US Department of Justice is charging Huawei and two of its US subsidiaries with racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\nThe US has also continued to pressure allies to block the company for their next-generation 5G wireless networks. However, January saw UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson giving the company approval to build non-core parts of the country's 5G infrastructure."

            "content": "Multiple events related to the James Bond movie No Time To Die have been canceled in China amid the Coronavirus outbreak. Deadline reports that promotional events for the movie, including premieres in Beijing and other cities, have been canceled in the wake of the virus that has already killed more than 1,600 people in China alone.\n\nStar Daniel Craig and other members of the No Time To Die cast were reportedly set to appear at the Beijing screening and other promotional events in China, but those plans have been scrapped \"because of uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the epidemic.\"\n\nChina is the world's second-largest movie market, following the United States, and the Coronavirus has already impacted the country's movie scene. Numerous theatres have closed indefinitely, and there is no word on when operations will resume.\n\nThe last James Bond movie, Spectre, made $84 million in China alone, which represented about 9.5 percent of its $881 million worldwide box office.\n\nNo Time To Die is directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (True Detective). The film stars Daniel Craig as Bond, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q, and Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny. Joining them for the first time will be Rami Malek, Billy Magnussen, and Ana de Armas.\n\nNo Time To Die is expected to be Craig's final outing as 007, and it remains a mystery as to who will take over in the future. Bond series producer Barbara Broccoli says 007 will never be played by a woman as long as she's in control of the franchise."

Four others who had attended the gathering in December were arrested previously, Hua told Reuters.\n\nXu was arrested on Saturday night by the Beijing police with assistance by police in Guangzhou, Hua said.\n\nThe Beijing and Guangzhou city police did not respond immediately to faxed requests for comment.\n\nXu's girlfriend, who was in Beijing, has not been reachable since Saturday, according to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch China researcher Yaqiu Wang.\n\nXu, a long-time activist for judicial and legal reform, in 2012 founded the New Citizens Movement, which called on government officials to disclose their wealth. He was sentenced in 2014 to four years in prison for his work with the group.\n\nIn recent weeks, Xu had written many articles criticising Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 70,000 people in China and killed 1,770.\n\nIn a Feb 4 article published on a website that is blocked in China and belongs to the New Citizens Movement, Xu called on Chinese President Xi Jinping to resign, citing his handling of crises, from Hong Kong's anti-government protests to the epidemic that originated in the central city of Wuhan.\n\n\"Medical supplies are tight, and the hospitals are overcrowded with people, and a large number of those infected are unable to have their cases verified,\" Xu wrote. \"You say you personally directed the deployment, it is a mess.\"\n\n\"Mr. Xi Jinping, please give way,\" he wrote.\n\nXu also criticized restrictions on Chinese media reporting of the epidemic centered in Wuhan and the strict lockdown measures implemented to contain it.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Huizhong Wu; Editing by Tony Munroe and Angus MacSwan)"

            "content": "Apple has shared an investor update this afternoon focused on the guidance it provided for Q2 2020. Due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, Apple says it won’t hit the March revenue guidance numbers it provided.\n\nApple had forecast a wider-than-usual range revenue range for Q2, predicting revenue between $63.0 billion and $67.0 billion. Apple now says it won’t hit even the lower-end of that range due to the effects of the coronavirus in China:\n\nOur quarterly guidance issued on January 28, 2020 reflected the best information available at the time as well as our best estimates about the pace of return to work following the end of the extended Chinese New Year holiday on February 10. Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter.\n\nApple cites two main reasons for this: worldwide constraints for iPhone supply and demand for Apple products within China. First, Apple says that manufacturing facilities in China have reopened, but with slower than expected production rates:\n\nThe first is that worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained. While our iPhone manufacturing partner sites are located outside the Hubei province — and while all of these facilities have reopened — they are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated.\n\nIt also says that Apple Stores in China are opening back up slowly, but with very low customer traffic:\n\nThe second is that demand for our products within China has been affected. All of our stores in China and many of our partner stores have been closed. Additionally, stores that are open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic. We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can.\n\nOutside of China, Apple tells investors that customer demand across the product and services categories has been “strong to date and in line with our expectations.” The disruption to Apple’s business is “only temporary,” it says. “Apple is fundamentally strong.”\n\nApple also reiterates that its first priority is the health and safety of its employees, supply chain partners, and customers. The company is also “more than doubling” its previously announced donation to support coronavirus health efforts.\n\nOur first priority — now and always — is the health and safety of our employees, supply chain partners, customers and the communities in which we operate. Our profound gratitude is with those on the front lines of confronting this public health emergency.\n\nRead Apple’s full announcement here. The company says it will provide more information during its fiscal Q2 2020 earnings release and call in April.\n\nThis is the second time in the past year and a half that Apple has issued a rare earnings guidance revision. For Q1 2019, Apple was forced to lower revenue expectations due to fewer iPhone upgrades and lower-than-expected iPhone sales in China.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

            "content": "During last week’s trading, there were more investors seeking to buy safe havens (gold, Japanese yen and to a lesser extent, the Swiss franc), with increasing losses due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus in the second largest economy in the world, and its expansion to many countries around the world. This is in addition to the renewed political tensions in Germany, the United States and Britain, and these factors were catalysts for gold investors to push prices to the $1585 resistance, near its highest level in seven years. COVID-19, the name of global epidemic, has exceeded 1,600 deaths and infected more than 68,000 cases in China alone. The Chinese government does not stop taking further measures to contain the crisis situation. The last of these measures, senior officials of the ruling Communist Party in Hubei and Wuhan were sacked and replaced last week.\n\nDespite the Chinese measures. Many, including the White House, have expressed concern about transparency from China, noting that US health personnel have not yet been allowed in. The Financial Times quoted a famous epidemiologist in London expressing concern that only about a tenth of the cases might be detected correctly. In Wuhan, it is suggested that the screening process may be more extreme, as it affects one out of 19 cases. On the economic side, the results of the Chinese economic data for January and February will be distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday this year, due to the new Coronavirus (Covid-19), the data will therefore be of very little value in the market.\n\nEconomists warn that optimism about controlling the epidemic is premature. Even if the auto industry and other businesses resume as planned, the activity will not return to normal until at least mid-March. The losses are expected to be so great that experts have lowered estimates of China's economic growth. Economists, including Capital Economics, believe that growth, which has already reached its lowest level in several decades, may drop to 2% in the three months to March, down from the official quarterly figure of 6%.\n\nAdvertisement Great trade opportunities are waiting - don't wait to profit from this pair! TRADE NOW\n\nAccording to the technical analysis of gold prices: As we expected before, we now confirm that gold prices are still inside the formation of a bullish channel and the recent global developments may push the price of gold to the $1611 psychological resistance very soon. Yellow metal purchases do not stop while the Coronavirus persists. Prices ignore the technical indicators reaching overbought areas, as bull control factors are increasing. There will be no bearish correction of gold prices without a break below the $1550 support in the near term. We expect quiet moves at the beginning of this week's trading in light of the American holiday, while observing the developments of the Covid 19-Chinese epidemic."
