            "content": "Going into 2020, the industrial sector had some cause for optimism. While 2019 was definitely a difficult year that dealt with headwinds like the U.S-China trade war, cyclical slowdowns in key industries such as automotive and consumer electronics, and the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, many industrial sector companies were hoping and predicting that the second half of 2020 would see a bounce back. Unfortunately, those bounce-back plans are likely to be put on the shelf.\n\nLet's take a look at why that is and at what investors can hope for from the sector for the rest of the year.\n\nThe playbook for 2020\n\nAs you can see in a table of the organic revenue growth guidance for 2020, it wasn't shaping up to be a great year for the industrial sector.\n\nCompany Key Activity Full-Year Organic Revenue Growth Guidance Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) Industrial automation (1.5)% to 1.5% General Electric (NYSE:GE) Aviation, power, renewable energy Low single-digit growth Honeywell (NYSE:HON) Aviation, building technology, advanced materials, industrial solutions 0% to 3% 3M (NYSE:MMM) Consumer products, healthcare, automotive, industrial products 0% to 2% Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) Broad-based industrial exposure including automotive, welding, food equipment, and electronics 0% to 2%\n\nHowever, it was expected to be a year of improvement in the second half, meaning many industrial stocks were hoping to end the year with good momentum going into 2021. Hopes were high that a natural cycle of replacement demand would kick off across the industrial sector coupled with ongoing strength in the commercial aerospace, construction, life sciences, and food and beverage sectors.\n\nMeanwhile, semiconductors were showing signs of cyclical improvement, and the stabilization in commodity prices was supposed to induce oil and gas and mining companies to be less tentative in continuing to increase capital spending. In addition, the automotive sector looked likely to stabilize after a couple of difficult years.\n\nUpside potential was there\n\nThere were also a few known unknowns that could serve as positive catalysts in 2020. First, an easing of the trade conflict would reduce tariff costs and ease some supply chain issues that manufacturers faced with sourcing products from China. Second, the return to service of the Boeing 737 MAX would boost aerospace growth and ripple through the industry. Third, the chart below shows how growth in the manufacturing sector -- measured here by the Institute for Supply Management purchasing managers index, where a reading above 50 indicates growth in the industrial economy -- doesn't tend to decouple from the overall economy for too long.\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nNo prizes for guessing the answer. Just as it seemed the industrial sector was about to get a few breaks -- an easing in the trade conflict and less pressure on costs -- the COVID-19 pandemic came along and scuppered hopes. Most worryingly of all, the strongest area of growth in the industrial sector, commercial aviation, has been hit by travel bans as the outbreak spread internationally from its origin in China. Even if the Boeing 737 MAX is granted an early return to service, airlines can't order it if they're going bust.\n\nMoreover, the price of oil has crashed as a consequence of a perfect storm of demand destruction and overproduction following a disagreement between Russia and OPEC on cutting production levels. As such, oil and gas companies are drastically cutting capital spending.\n\nIn addition, given the overall hit to economic growth as a result of the COVID-19 containment measures as well as enforced production shutdowns, it's not surprising to see the industrial sector under-performing the broader markets.\n\nWhere next\n\nAerospace and oil and gas are probably the two hardest-hit areas in the current malaise, and there's the real prospect of bankruptcies among airlines and oil producers. Clearly, oil services companies and technology providers such as Apergy will see their earnings under pressure in the current environment.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing and some of the largest industrial companies, such as GE, Honeywell, and United Technologies, have significant aerospace exposure, and it's far from clear how aviation demand will pan out even after the novel coronavirus is contained.\n\nIn addition, companies in cyclical industries such as mining are likely to curtail spending plans, too. All of this means companies with heavy industries exposure could be challenged across the board. That wouldn't be great news for Illinois Tool Works or industrial suppliers such as Fastenal or MSC Industrial.\n\nThe bullish case\n\nThe optimistic scenario is based on the idea that the market has priced in a severe and protracted economic contraction that isn't actually going to happen. It's a view supported by the fact that China already appears to have contained the outbreak and is in the process of normalizing its economy. If the same thing happens across the globe, and air travel returns as it did after the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, then investors are likely to feel more confident.\n\nIt's a compelling argument, but it requires a number of things to go right as part of the process. Moreover, it's far from clear how governments will act in order to contain the pandemic or even prophylactically stop a resurgence -- industrial stocks are particularly hard-hit because of their global supply chains.\n\nAll told, it's going to be a year full of uncertainty for the industrial sector, and investors should be prepared for earnings downgrades even for stocks that are good long-term values. It could get worse before it gets better for the sector."

But Iran‚Äôs top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected the offer. Although Iranian authorities have said U.S. sanctions had hindered its efforts to curb the outbreak, Rouhani said :‚ÄùThe sanctions have failed to hamper our efforts to fight against the coronavirus outbreak.‚Äù‚ÄùWe are almost self-sufficient in producing all necessary equipment to fight the coronavirus. We have been much more successful than many other countries in the fight against this disease,‚Äù Rouhani said.\n\nSeveral countries, including the United Arab Emirates, China, Britain, France, Qatar and Turkey, have sent shipments of medical supplies, including gloves and surgical masks, to Iran.In the first transaction conducted under a trade mechanism set up to barter humanitarian goods and food after Washington‚Äôs withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Germany said on Tuesday that France, Germany and Britain had exported medical goods to Iran.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick Coronavirus guide from Express Explained to keep you updated: What can cause a COVID-19 patient to relapse after recovery? | COVID-19 lockdown has cleaned up the air, but this may not be good news.

            "content": "So far, the United States has reported only one drug shortage as a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the structure of the drug supply chain means the country could see more. And because of the secrecy built into the pharmaceutical supply chain to protect companies‚Äô trade secrets, it‚Äôs hard for regulators and public health officials to figure out exactly what drugs may be hard to come by, and when.\n\nTo start to understand those dynamics, we have to start at the source: The drug manufacturing plants located all over the world.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you get a bottle of drug, and it has Pfizer‚Äôs name on it, it doesn‚Äôt mean that Pfizer makes that product,‚Äù says Erin Fox, a professor of pharmacotherapy at the University of Utah and expert on drug shortages. The drug company on a prescription bottle is merely the party that is selling you the medication. ‚ÄúLots of drug companies hire other companies to make the drugs for them.‚Äù\n\nAbout 90% of all active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, are made outside the US, according to a 2019 paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research. And once a factory makes a drug‚Äôs API, that product may be shipped to another company to make the actual drug. Per the NBER, about 60% of these secondary companies are also outside the US.\n\nBased on the FDA‚Äôs records, the US has nearly 4,000 manufacturing plants that either make APIs, drugs, or both‚Äîthe most in the world. But China and India have the second and third most, at 634 and 639 respectively. All of these countries have been hit heavily by Covid-19, and it‚Äôs not clear how production of specific drugs has been disrupted‚Äîif at all.\n\nWhy is that so difficult to know? While the FDA keeps a list of these manufacturers, it doesn‚Äôt require them to say what they make; that information is considered proprietary.\n\nImportantly, manufacturing companies are usually tasked with meeting long-term demand projections. They do what pharmaceutical companies tell them to‚Äîwhich is usually make a certain amount of a drug based on the demand over the last five years or so. This quantity doesn‚Äôt account easily for global emergencies that may dramatically accelerate demand.\n\nDistribution, large and small\n\nDrug companies with patented medications have exclusive rights to make those products; instead of manufacturing those abroad, they may choose to import the APIs and manufacture the drugs themselves. But even so, they have to go elsewhere for the next step in the process‚Äîdistribution.\n\nOnce these drugs are finished, they‚Äôre shipped off to wholesale distributors. In the US, that‚Äôs likely one of three main companies: AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson. These companies organize all the drugs for distribution in the US, store them in times of need, and may even buy them back when there‚Äôs less demand for them.\n\nWholesalers ship drugs to pharmacies‚Äîwhich is technically anywhere that drugs are dispensed to people. Most people in the US receive their medications from a pharmacy in their neighborhood, or in the hospital, but some pharmacies can send medications through mail orders, or operate out of long-term care facilities.\n\nIf there‚Äôs high demand for a drug, it‚Äôs up to pharmacists at each of those locations to fill it by contacting the wholesalers. But if there is a shortage, wholesalers work to distribute what they have across different pharmacies equally, so that every location has the same amount.\n\nSo what does this mean for getting your drugs?\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to say.\n\nIn late February, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‚Äîwhich keeps an official tally of drug shortages based on manufacturers‚Äô reports‚Äîidentified 20 drugs at risk of going into shortage whose active pharmaceutical ingredients are made in China. So far, only one of those drugs, which was not named in the press announcement, is in short supply, but the agency also noted that there are alternatives doctors can use for patients in need.\n\nDrug shortages are a regular occurrence‚Äîthere‚Äôs almost always a running list‚Äîso not all of the 147 drugs currently in shortage in the US are related to the pandemic. Some existed ahead of time, and others are a result of shifts in the market.\n\nThe FDA isn‚Äôt the only source of information on shortages. According to the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists, some hospitals are already reporting shortages of some drugs used to keep people on ventilators or to open up airways. But again, this doesn‚Äôt mean that patients are out of luck‚Äîin most cases pharmacists and other health care providers can come up with workarounds for these shortages. If one drug isn‚Äôt available, there‚Äôs likely a similar one that can do the job for any given patient.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control recommends that consumers keep an extra short-term supply of their own daily prescriptions in the event of an emergency (like a pandemic), but it doesn‚Äôt say for how long. The good news, Fox says, is that medications in pill form‚Äîwhich make up the majority of at-home drugs‚Äîare relatively easy to make, compared to hospital drugs. So even if there is a shortage, it hopefully won‚Äôt be for long."

But now that China has defeated the virus, the food markets have resumed business again.\n\nOn 28 March, China began to lift a two-month lockdown on the Chinese city of Wuhan ‚Äì where the COVID-19 virus first emerged ‚Äì after the country declared its victory against the virus outbreak, Reuters reported.\n\nDirector of the National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei said that the country had contained the virus, with Wuhan having about 63,000 COVID-19 patients being discharged.\n\nFollowing that, a Daily Mail correspondent photographed a medicine seller who resumed its business with a billboard advertising bats, scorpions, and other animals.\n\n‚ÄòEveryone here believes the outbreak is over and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about anymore. It‚Äôs just a foreign problem now as far as they are concerned,‚Äô said one of the Daily Mail‚Äôs China-based correspondents.\n\nAnother correspondent in Dongguan told Daily Mail that the markets have resumed business the same way as they did before the virus outbreak.\n\n‚ÄúThe only difference is that security guards try to stop anyone taking pictures which would never have happened before,‚Äù the correspondent said.\n\nMeanwhile, Wuhan reported one imported case earlier today (1 April) after having no new cases for seven consecutive days, Xinhua reported.\n\nHowever, some residents and analysts seem to doubt the virus transmission rate reported by officials and concerned that the Chinese government only prioritizes restarting the economy and not containing the virus, The Guardian reported on 23 March.\n\n‚ÄúI am really worried that there are still many asymptomatic infected people inside Wuhan. As soon as everyone goes back to work, everyone will be infected,‚Äù a citizen named Wang told The Guardian.\n\nAccording to RHTK‚Äôs report on 23 March, residents said patients have been turned away by the hospitals despite showing symptoms of the COVID-19 disease.\n\nWuhan resident, Wan, said that his 70-year-old mother suffered from pneumonia again after being discharged from the hospital and now has been placed under isolation at a hotel. He added that no hospitals wanted to admit her as she was not tested positive for the virus.\n\nAnother resident, Zhang Yi indicated that it is a political need to ensure mainland authorities claim there have been no new local cases of the virus, adding that he received messages from officials showing that there were still people with the disease in Wuhan.\n\n‚ÄúWhether the official figure is accurate or not, I think you will know. This is a political treatment, not medical treatment,‚Äù he noted."
