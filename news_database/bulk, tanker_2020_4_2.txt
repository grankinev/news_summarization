            "content": "The near-term outlook for major shipping segments like dry bulk, containers and offshore is negative as global trade will be impacted due to the Covid-19 outbreak, said in its note today.\n\nThe exceptions to this trend, however, are oil tankers, where the sharp drop in oil prices has led to an increase in demand - both for supply of oil and for floating storage.\n\nAs a result, tanker rates significantly increased though their sustainability beyond the near term remains to be seen.\n\nWhile the overall outlook is challenging in the near-term, the impact on shipping companies with a high share of tankers should be mitigated due to high tanker rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Coronavirus LIVE: Govt says rise in cases because of Delhi mosque travelers\n\n“The credit profile of Indian shipping companies is expected to remain under stress in the near-term and companies which are highly leveraged will be adversely impacted by the downturn. The implementation of the IMO-2020 norms has also led to an increase in operating costs for the sector, due to higher cost of low sulphur fuel, although the drop in crude oil prices has mitigated the impact to an extent, K Ravichandran, senior vice president and group head of Ratings was quoted as saying.\n\n“The coastal shipping segment which had witnessed healthy growth in the last few years, supported by the Government’s push to increase share of transportation of this segment, will also witness some adverse impact in the near term, mainly in the container segment, whereas the impact on the bulk segment may be limited due to largely the essential nature of those commodities, which will not be impacted by the lockdown,” he added.\n\nAlthough the impact of pandemic is currently evolving, most of the major economies starting with China have implemented extended lockdowns, leading to disruption in supply chains and severe slowdown in economic activities is expected in major regions.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Centre unveils plan to deal with 'psycho-social issues' of migrant workers\n\nThe charter rates for dry bulk and container segments have witnessed a steep moderation in the last two months. Further, the steep fall in crude oil prices, following OPEC’s inability to arrive at an agreement for production cuts, is expected to result in moderation in E&P activity at least over the next six months to one year, which is going to have an adverse impact on the offshore segment.\n\nThe recovery in the global shipping sector will be contingent on the recovery in global economic activity.\n\n“The recovery in the shipping sectors like dry bulk and containers will depend on the recovery in global economic activity, post abatement of the Covid-19 outbreak, starting from China, the timeline for which remains uncertain at present as the crisis is still at an evolving stage. Further, any major changes in global industrial supply chain, during the recovery phase will also have an impact on shipping trade routes. Additionally, a supply side correction in the form of increased scrapping, should also be beneficial for the sector in the recovery phase,” the note quoted Sai Krishna, assistant vice president at Ratings as saying."

            "content": "For smooth flow of essential commodities during the lockdown period, the edible oil industry has suggested relaxations in customs rules and allowing unrestricted inter-state movement of packed and raw edible oils to the government.\n\nDuring a video conference with the Union Government officials, the edible oil trade body, Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA) has suggested that imported crude edible oil vessels should be cleared immediately on a simple undertaking from importers that it would be sold only after refining. The Customs department should give the Out of Charge forthwith after this. And for the testing of import samples, it has suggested that NABL-accredited laboratories at Kandla/Mundra can be utilised to expedite the process.\n\nKandla and Mundra ports handle nearly 30-40 per cent of import of edible oils in India. These are refined at the Kandla/Mundra refineries and then dispatched across the country by tanker lorries in bulk or in small packages. “To maintain the supply chain, it is necessary that such transportation be granted National permit for multi State transport by issuing the E-pass,” SEA Chairman Atul Chaturvedi stated in his suggestions.\n\nDomestic crushing units are operating with 40-50 per cent capacity. The demand has shifted to household consumption (small packs), hence the supply of raw material/packaging material need to be ensured.\n\nHe also suggested that inter-state movement of raw and in-packed oils should be allowed unrestricted. “It is important that State border check posts should be adequately sensitised to allow passage of edible oil lorries / tankers without harassment. Empty returning lorries should also be allowed to pass unhindered,” he said adding, “We would also suggest banning sales of loose edible oils to consumers to ensure safety in these difficult times.”\n\nThe edible oil body has also suggested the Centre to exempt oilseeds crushing and processing units from procuring raw material from the APMCs (mandis) and allow purchase directly from farmers. Currently, all mandis are closed leading to shortage of raw materials for crushing mills."

            "content": "When the four week lockdown was announced consumers dashed to supermarket to buy supplies, with flour quickly disappearing from the shelves.\n\nSince then it appears to be difficult to find, but not for the reason you might think.\n\nIt turns out the issue isn't with the production of the flour - it's with the packaging.\n\nDAVID WHITE/STUFF When the lockdown was announced there was a dramatic increase in the demand for flour.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, retail flour accounts for less than 10 per cent of the flour in New Zealand, NZ Flour Mills Association executive director Niki Urwin said.\n\nAbout 225 thousand tonnes of flour is produced in New Zealand each year but most of it is distributed in bulk form in tanker trucks or rail and sent to bakeries, where it's made into bread.\n\nKEVIN STENT It continues to be a product that is hard to source but industry says there is plenty of flour in the country, just not enough packaging.\n\nSmaller bakeries and cafes received their flour in 20kg bags and the last bracket of flour produced was retail flour, which came in much smaller sizes and ends up on supermarket shelves.\n\nWhen the move to alert level four was imposed retail sales spiked, which put pressure on the packing lines, Urwin said.\n\n\"When the demand rose flour mills ramped up and went as fast as they could, but then ran into packaging problems and that all flowed down.\"\n\nGetting packaging normally took anywhere from six to nine weeks so the issue was not producing the flour, it was how to get the flour produced into small packages and into the supermarkets.\n\n\"The retail market typically doesn't have big demands.\"\n\nHe said the company his mill worked with had been great and moved their production forward with urgency.\n\nThey didn't supply small retail bags but did produce 20kg bags, which he said supermarkets were now starting to take to put in their stores to fill the gap in the market.\n\n\"Those big sizes everyone is hoping will saturate the market a lot quicker.\"\n\nIn terms of the industry he said they had not seen this much shift in demand in at least the past 10 years.\n\nWhen the lockdown was lifted and life shifted back to normal, Urwin said it would be interesting to see if the way people consumed food changed because of this.\n\nQuick message to all those making bread at the moment. Keep the water you’ve cooked potatoes or pasta in. It will help the bread’s texture and rise. — Nigella Lawson (@Nigella_Lawson) March 26, 2020\n\nBaking products in general had been snapped up by consumers as they prepared for the lockdown, Foodstuffs head of corporate affairs Antoinette Laird said.\n\nThis could be because people had time to create their best and brightest baking sensations.\n\n\"Our suggestion is customers focus on working through the baking items they have in their cupboards and give the supply chain a bit of a chance to get back up to normal levels.\"\n\nA temporary mechanical breakdown at the Mauri Wellington Mill had halted production but general manager Steve Pedersen said the issue had been fixed and production was up and running.\n\nHe said their people were working extremely hard to restock supermarket shelves across New Zealand.\n\n\"We realise the importance of baking in the current environment and will continue to do our upmost to ensure ongoing supply to New Zealand's retailers.\"\n\nFarmers Mill flour mill in Timaru had used about four years worth of their smaller 5kg flour bag packaging in just a few weeks, business development manager Rebecca Biggs said.\n\nTheir mill didn't sell a large amount of retail flour with most of their flour supply going to in-store bakeries.\n\nThis supply was not disrupted as they received 20kg bags, but demand had increased for those bags as well.\n\nShe was aware of a few stores that had put the 20kg bags out on the floor so customers had the option of purchasing them.\n\nTheir packaging was made at a plant in Auckland and the earliest they could get more 5kg bags was six weeks away."

Lyons, commander, U.S. Transportation Command\n\nGENERAL STEPHEN R. LYONS: Hey, (Staff). General Steve Lyons here. How do you hear me? Over.\n\nSTAFF: Pretty good.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Okay, great. Hey, well listen, thanks.\n\nAnd thanks to everybody that's on the net. I appreciate it very much. And I appreciate the level of effort that the media's going through to keep the public informed of all that's going on in the crisis, and I'm happy to help in any way that I can. You, like a logistics enterprise, don't get to sit out a crisis.\n\nSo just a couple comments to start with, and then I'll go right to questions.\n\nFor those that may not be familiar with Transportation Command, as one of the 11 COCOMs in the Department of Defense, we run the department's global mobility enterprise; so our ability to project and sustain the force on a global scale.\n\nSo you think about airlift, sealift, aerial refuel, aerial medical evacuation, planes, ships, trains, trucks, if you would. That's a combination of both military capability, and many of you think of the gray-tail airplane, but it's also a commercial capability that we leverage as well, both in terms of sealift and airlift and other particular areas.\n\nWe do see -- as a result of the secretary's stop movement orders, we are seeing a reduction in movements, as you would expect, across the enterprise. But we are also seeing a necessity to continue to operate for mission-essential tasks and operations.\n\nOur priorities directly mirror the secretary's priorities. We're focused on protecting and preserving the force against the CV-19 outbreak, maintaining mission readiness. Proud to report at this point, we -- we are mission-ready to do whatever the secretary asks us to do. And then, third, to support the FEMA and broader interagency efforts to counter the -- the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nWe've done several things in that particular area we can talk about along the way. We are supporting the State Department in their task force repatriation effort. We have moved things in support of HHS -- for example, corona test swabs -- across the globe. We've helped to move field hospitals that you see being built in places like New York and the state of Washington.\n\nWe're -- we're pleased to help. We're proud of all that we do every day.\n\nAnd let me pause there, I'm happy to take any questions that you may have.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, sir. I'm going to go to Ryan Browne with CNN for the first question from here.\n\nQ: Hello, General. Thank you for doing this. Two quick ones for you.\n\nYou mentioned the efforts to fly some of the testing swabs and the field hospitals around. Is there a limit on how much you can move or is -- is there more -- do you have more capability you could bring to bear to that effort?\n\nObviously, there's -- there's – it's spread all across the 50 states now, so are you -- are you kind of putting -- raising your hand and saying, \"We have these kind of assets. We could do more of this\"?\n\nAnd has that involved any of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet? Have you had to tap into that to, kind of, help move this stuff around?\n\nGEN. LYONS: Yeah, Ryan, great question.\n\nWe've been able to respond to any of the mission requirements that have come to us thus far.\n\nYou know, with the -- with the reduction in major movements -- and we -- you know, we typically, on an average day, we've just got thousands of movements, moving across the globe -- we do have some capacity.\n\nAn area in which I look at capacity and I really -- from two perspectives, you mentioned CRAF, the Civil Reserve Aviation Fleet. On the cargo side, the Civil Aviation Fleet is really going pretty strong. On the passenger side, as you can imagine, it has dropped off significantly.\n\nAnd so as we take on missions, we're specifically looking for opportunities to workload our commercial partners. We're talking to them regularly. I am concerned, to some degree, about the impacts on the passenger segment of the aviation industry. And so any opportunity we have to push workload in their direction, we're doing that. We're doing that largely with the repatriation efforts and -- and other efforts of that sort.\n\nSo hopefully that answers your question.\n\nQ: That does.\n\nAnd actually, if I could follow up on that very quickly, you mentioned the repatriations. Are you -- there seems to be a mix. Sometimes it's military, sometimes it's charter. Do you anticipate additional military repatriation flights in the next week or so? Or are -- do you -- or is that now, kind of, in the civilian transportation, kind of, hands?\n\nGEN. LYONS: Yeah, you know, the way I would describe it is that our main effort in repatriation, those missions that are coming from the task force at the State Department -- and the State Department's really done a great job on this. And so we're their overflow valve. Those missions are being workloaded into the commercial sector, aviation sector. So to your point, our CRAF partners.\n\nThere are some residual movements that will continue out of -- you know, what I would describe on the margin. As we move gray-tail aircraft around the globe, where there's space available, opportune lift, you know, we'll present opportunities for those geographic commanders to put -- you know, to put emphasis on those as the situation represents.\n\nBut the main effort will be on commercial airlines. Over.\n\nQ: Thank you.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, and we'll go to the phone now. Bob Burns, are you on?\n\nQ: Yes, I am. Thank you.\n\nGeneral, this is Bob Burns with Associated Press.\n\nAre you -- is TRANSCOM flying test kits or other medical supplies or medical personnel to Guam to assist the Theodore Roosevelt with its COVID-19 outbreak?\n\nGEN. LYONS: You know, Bob, we're watching that very closely. We don't have a requirement at the moment specifically -- you know, a separate requirement to do that. We do operate regularly what I would call channels, just regularly scheduled missions across the globe. Sometimes people characterize them as Patriot Express, that's the -- kind of the name of the mission that we have and those missions will continue to carry whatever priority cargo is required in whatever region of the globe.\n\nSo I haven't received any specific requirements on -- on the T.R. but, you know, if something comes our way we're -- we're more than willing to do whatever our Navy counterparts need. Over.\n\nQ: Thank you.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, we'll come back to the press briefing room here for the next question.\n\nQ: General, Lucas Tomlinson, Fox News. How do you practice social distancing on a C-17?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGEN. LYONS: I think -- I think the question was how do you practice social distance on the C-17. Is -- was that the question? Over.\n\nQ: That is, sir.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Yeah, it's a great question. And obviously when you're in the cockpit, there's no way to get six foot apart. And so, you know, the way that we're managing our flight crews is unique in many ways and we're trying to create an -- an isolated system of systems, if you would, even in motion.\n\nSo the way we treat our flight crews is, you know, they can't create social distancing inside the cockpit. Where we billet them is controlled, where they eat from, their food is delivered. So we're trying to create a very concerted cocoon, if you would, over our entire flight crew apparatus.\n\nAnd knock on wood, that seems to be working to date. It allows us to continue mission and protect the force at the same time. But there are -- you know, you can't telework and fly a plane, at least not on the -- on the -- you know, on the lift side of the house. And so there are exceptions that we're working through to how to mitigate those. Over.\n\nQ: And just a follow up, you mentioned this cocoon and that you can't telework while flying a plane. How many people in TRANSCOM have tested positive for COVID-19?\n\nGEN. LYONS: Well it's a fair question. We're not -- you know, we're not talking about numbers related to specific units for many good reasons that we won't talk about specific numbers.\n\nWhat I would characterize, though, is that at this particular moment in time, our COVID-positive rates are very, very low, single digits across the entire mobility enterprise.\n\nYou know, that -- that will change over time, I acknowledge that and every day we're making a concerted effort to understand how do we protect the force and maintain a level of resiliency to -- to operate this global mobility enterprise for the department.\n\nQ: Finally, one last question. How concerned are you with your aircraft flying all over the world with this pandemic globally? How do you keep these crews from picking up the virus somewhere, let's say in Europe, and bringing it back to the United States?\n\nGEN. LYONS: Well it's a -- it's a great question and we spend a lot of time working through this issue and particularly at the air component. But back to as I was describing earlier on the way we're managing our air crews and our attendants, very, very isolated. You might characterize it as isolation in motion.\n\nBut as they go into a particular country, it's very, very limited, straight from the aircraft into billets. They don't go out for food, they don't leave the billet until their next mission, and it's a very, very controlled environment, as you can appreciate. And that's how we mitigate moving from a country that might be a level-three country -- they never -- they never actually leave that base. And even inside that base, they're very, very controlled and that's the way we're managing that. Over.\n\nQ: Thank you.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, before we go on, I'd remind you again to please mute your phone. We're getting some feedback from somebody. And with that, we'll go to Mr. David Martin with CBS. Are you on the line, sir?\n\nQ: I am. General, could you give us some specifics on the number of missions you've flown, both for repatriation and in response to HHS/FEMA?\n\nGEN. LYONS: David, specifically (inaudible) we have flown to date approximately three million COVID test swabs, for example, in support of HHS. That -- you know, that was a very specific mission. We're working broader missions for FEMA as they come.\n\nAnd then specifically on the repatriation effort, you know, to -- to date that's been a couple thousand, either, you know, executed or being planned. We know that's going to grow significantly. We received a mission on Friday afternoon from the secretary to provide direct support to task force repatriation in the State Department, and we're -- we're -- we're great partners with the State Department as they've done a great job. And overall, I think they've moved closer to probably 27,000 to 30,000 AMCITs (American Citizens) and that number continues to grow every day.\n\nSo we are pleased to join our State Department partners and you know we've got several missions planned, a dozen -- probably half a dozen missions this week and continue to grow and we'll continue to support that effort in any way we can. Over.\n\nQ: Just to follow up, are those half dozen missions like the previous ones, which are -- sound like they are space available on -- on flights that are normally going from these locations? And on the FEMA missions, are the only FEMA missions you've flown to date the -- the three million swabs? Because it sounds like you have a lot of unused capacity right now.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Let -- let me ask -- let me answer both questions. On the repatriation effort, no, no, those are very, very specific individual missions. We stood up a -- a -- an actual repatriation task force here at TRANSCOM that's linked directly to State and we are scheduling commercial passenger airlines for those specific repatriation missions in support of the State Department. There will still be small numbers that move on a space-available basis but the main effort is through our -- our civil reserve aviation fleet partners that we use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nOn your second question with regard to support to FEMA, interagency, HHS, et cetera, there is -- there is more work ongoing, for sure. I highlighted the three million swabs. We're supporting the -- you know, the transportation support for NORTHCOM -- is to move the hospitals, for example, up into the Javits Center, up into Seattle, and many other mission assignments as they come.\n\nSo as -- as -- as missions come our way, we're prepared to support that. The secretary has made it clear that that's a line of effort, a priority line of effort, and we're prepared to respond to that, and we're working very, very closely with NORTHCOM, FEMA and all the other agencies as things -- as -- and -- and -- and frankly, there's just hundreds of missions every day that move from the Defense Logistics Agency and other agencies like that that don't even -- don't even come up above the radar.\n\nSTAFF: Okay. We -- are we still connected?\n\nGEN. LYONS: We -- we still are.\n\nSTAFF: Okay. All right, with that, again, I ask, please put your phone on mute. And with that, I'll go to Tara Copp, if she's on the line.\n\nQ: Hi, yes I am. Thanks, General, for doing this.\n\nI have a follow-up to Bob's question. You know, there was an article in the San Francisco Chronicle today that the captain -- or, the commanding officer of that ship is desperate for tests. So, who would give you a request to get a TRANSCOM flight out there to get them tests and -- and medical assistance? And then secondly, on the 27,000 to 30,000, if I'm -- I'm correct, American civilians you've helped work through repatriation for, can you give us some of, like, where the -- where there were bulk numbers of citizens that you brought back?\n\nAnd then last, on flying test kits around, do you have any breakdown by state of what flights you've flown, what materials you've delivered? Of course, there's a lot of interest from the states about who's getting what and -- and what's on deck. Thank you very much.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Okay. To -- to your first question on the -- on the T.R., the -- you know, the -- the Navy has a lot of capacity available to it, and they typically, internal to the Navy, resupply their -- their ships that are underway. And so we -- we would -- by exception, if we got a mission either from Navy or from the Joint Staff if they ask for specific support, I mean, we'd certainly step in and support whatever they needed. But they've got a lot of capacity and -- and -- and I can't speak for what -- what that looks like on the ground, so I won't speculate to what the requirements might be. But we're -- we're certainly prepared to support them.\n\nI think you asked for some specifics on the AMCIT repatriation mission. We'd just, again, say that Friday afternoon we received that mission and the first mission, as I understand it, is scheduled to head for Nigeria, and that schedule, I think, is -- is Thursday of this week. So that -- so I'll give you an example of the schedule that I'm looking at. It's -- it's 150 passengers coming out of Nigeria, and those passengers would come back into Dulles and -- and -- and be received into the continental United States. There's other missions of that sort, so you know, if you think about Central and South America, I think the focus right now is on Africa, and then obviously, we're seeing some missions start to emerge from the Indo-Pacific. But -- but that's building every day. I'll -- I'll pause for any additional comments. Over.\n\nQ: Okay, and just, thank you for that.\n\nAnd just, my last question -- do you have a breakdown by state of how many missions you have flown or supported through either charter air or mil air to get test kits out to the states, or medical equipment? Thank you.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Okay. Well, you know, look, we'll take that -- I -- I think -- if you -- if your -- if your question's specifically about the 3 million, those test swabs came in directly to the FedEx Memphis hub for onward distribution to state and municipalities, as required and -- and as directed by the -- by the whole-of-government effort.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, sir, we're going to come back to the room here. We have a question in the room.\n\nQ: Yes, sir. Mike Glenn with the Washington Times.\n\nI was wondering, what percentage of work being done by TRANSCOM is devoted specifically to the coronavirus, COVID-19, and what percentage is still focused on your normal -- your -- your day-to-day operations? And could you talk a little bit about what impact all this might have had on readiness for TRANSCOM?\n\nGEN. LYONS: Mike, good -- good questions.\n\nWe're -- you know, we're -- we're still operating the global mobility enterprise. We still must do that to maintain our level of readiness for the secretary. And so I believe we are doing that. I believe we are ready. I've just -- I reported to the -- to the secretary that we are ready to meet our mission requirements as -- as they come.\n\nProportionally, you know, we're still going through -- there's -- there's -- as you can appreciate, there might be some lagging movements on the stop movements, so we're still working through what the exceptions to policy are, what's absolutely essential inside the department to continue to move, what actually we're going to stop move on. So there's a lot of activity that's still underway. We do forecast that's on the decline.\n\nBut nonetheless, as I talk about global mobility and for example, the scheduled missions around the globe which we call, you know, regularly-scheduled channels, for example, we'll continue to operate those, even though, you know, our utilization rate of those aircraft has probably dropped considerably, right, down to about 30 to 50 percent. We know that those are the lifelines for the units that are out in the field, so we'll continue to operate that, you know, regardless of utilization rates.\n\nAnd then the special assigned missions, we anticipate those will -- will come down, you know, particularly as we really drew down the efforts for major exercises like Defender Europe and otherwise. And so -- and then we'll start to pick up in -- in other areas like support to the interagency in COVID efforts as that comes. So I wouldn't necessarily, you know, without looking (inaudible) I wouldn't characterize it as a percentage, but we shift -- we shift -- this is what we do every day anyway. We shift to where the global priorities are and as the secretary describes them, and that's the way the global mobility enterprise is built, to be able to shift to the priority requirements across the globe.\n\nQ: Thank you very much.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, now we go back to the phone. Phil Stewart with Reuters, are you on?\n\nQ: I am, thanks.\n\nA question about just your -- your role in internal domestic U.S. potential support. Are you developing any -- any plans to potentially help ensure logistics/transportation of -- of -- of basic goods in the United States, should the supply chain in the United States break down?\n\nThanks.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Well, you know, the -- the domestic freight, both rail and motor freight, that we utilize as the Department of Defense is largely a commercial backbone. And so we're working very, very closely with our commercial partners and the Department of Transportation. And all indicators are that -- that freight is actually moving. And in some areas, it's actually spiking, like on air freight, in ways that we wouldn't have seen otherwise.\n\nSo domestic freight, it -- it's a good sign because that supply chain must move regardless, right? I mean, the logistics underpinning of the nation must continue.\n\nAnd so we're working with the Department of Transportation as they look at this and they -- they want to ensure that there's continued -- continued freight across the continental United States; for example, any policy implications that they need to look at.\n\nAnd so we do not see any -- any downturn in freight for the most part. There are some specific sectors that will be impacted. I mean, we're working very, very closely with -- with the household goods industry, because at this time of year, we would normally be on a -- a steep ramp to the summer peak season. And now we're really, kind of, throttled back on that mission set.\n\nAnd so, you know, every -- every industry sector's a little bit different. Passenger airlines very concerned about, Passenger -- freight is up, freight -- motor -- surface freight, motor freight, rail freight continues to -- to run unimpeded.\n\nAnd then what -- I think to your broader question, for example, if the commissary or exchange services that support our families and service members overseas were at all degraded, we're certainly prepared to step in, and we've been talking to Defense Commissary Agency about those kind of contingency plans.\n\nSo hopefully that helps answer your question. Over.\n\nQ: But, I mean, is there any sense that TRANSCOM may have to play a more active role in -- in doing the basic movement of -- of goods in the United States domestically?\n\nGEN. LYONS: Not on the private sector, commercial side. There's no indicator that that would be required. We would use very similar sets of commercial providers as exist today in the existing supply chains.\n\nSTAFF: Okay. And with that, we'll go on.\n\nTravis Tritten with Bloomberg, are you on?\n\nQ: Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me?\n\nGEN. LYONS: I can hear you, Travis, go ahead.\n\nQ: Great. Thank you, sir.\n\nI wanted to ask you a follow-up on Phil's question. I wanted to ask you about the moving industry and household goods movements. Obviously, those have been halted. And the industry is particularly vulnerable because it gets so much of its revenue from DOD, and they've warned that some of the companies may go out of business.\n\nI'm wondering if you're concerned if the domestic moving industry could be gutted by this outbreak, this pandemic. And if this could further reduce the capacity to move troops around when we eventually do come out the other side, which has obviously been -- been a big issue?\n\nAnd I have a follow-up question as well.\n\nGEN. LYONS: So I think your -- I think your question's an excellent question.\n\nAnd the answer is yes. I am very, very concerned, especially for our small-business partners that make up so much of the -- you know, the household goods moving industry.\n\nYou know, we're -- we're very, very active in our communication, both with the industry sector and the services who are, you know, managing the exception to policy on the moves, to make sure we're at least seeing -- seeing things the same way in terms of managing expectations and workload.\n\nAnd I think this -- this -- you know, this package that the Congress passed last week, I think will come into play here. It will be very, very important that we protect our small business across the nation. And so we're watching that very closely.\n\nQ: And if I could just follow up, I wanted to ask about the status of the global household goods moving contract, which I believe it was around this timeframe that you had, I think, hoped to wrap that up before. I'm just wondering how the pandemic has affected that timeline and how you're looking at that now.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Well, at the moment, the work that's been done on that has largely been unaffected by the COVID outbreak, because all the preliminary work is largely completed. So at the moment, we're on the same timeline that we were originally, which is really at the end of April was our target to -- to make an award.\n\nYou know, we assess every day, based on the COVID situation, what we're doing and what we're not doing. So if things change in that area, we'll adjust them as needed. We're certainly not going to put, you know, people or industry at risk in any kind of way.\n\nBut there's -- administratively, we're continuing to -- to move on that.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, we're near the end of our time but we just have a few more questions. I'm going to try to squeeze in a couple more real quick here.\n\nCourtney Albon, are you on? Courtney?\n\nQ: Hi, yes. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nI wanted to ask a broader tanker capacity question.\n\nThe Air Force announced yesterday that they'd elevated a new KC-46 cat one deficiency involving excessive fuel leaks. Are you concerned about how this issue might impact the program's delivery schedule along with the other cat one deficiencies?\n\nAnd are you making any progress with the Air Force and Congress on finding ways to -- to mitigate the capacity gap there?\n\nGEN. LYONS: Yes, Courtney.\n\nI -- well, yes, I believe we're making progress with the Air Force and -- and Congress to ensure that we retain a taskable capacity for the combatant commands to support the joint force. You know, while simultaneously the Air Force works through the technical issues with Boeing to make sure that the KC-46 presents a viable capability that can essentially -- well, basically refuel everything that the KC-135 refuels today.\n\nI -- I'm not going to get in -- you know, I'm not going to get ahead of the Air Force and their negotiations with Boeing specifically. I can -- I can tell you that things have been much more optimistic here of late. I think, you know, the big key there is to move to a mutually agreed upon technical solution and lay out those timelines.\n\nFor me specifically, I know that we've got to preserve aerial refuel capabilities for the joint force until such that the KC-46 is presentable. And we're working with the Air Force on that and I do think we have good agreement on a bridging strategy at this particular point.\n\nThanks for the question.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, and really quickly, I'm going to go to Jeff Schogol if he's on.\n\nQ: Hi, this is Jeff Schogol with Task and Purpose.\n\nI'm just curious: Has Air Mobility Command medevaced any patients to civilian hospitals or to -- or to military hospitals due to COVID-19?\n\nGEN. LYONS: We have. And I'll spend a little bit of time describing that to you.\n\nIt's a good question, because the movement of a highly contagious patient is a much different challenge. And we did move a COVID-positive patient this past weekend from -- from AFRICOM, specifically from Djibouti, up to Landstuhl in Germany to get the level of support that particular patient needed. And -- and we are also working, candidly, to increase our capacity to be able to meet these kind of requirements because we know they're increasing.\n\nSo today, our approach to patient movement for COVID, particularly for highly contagious patients, is to move them in an isolation system, either air ambulance or you may recall the transportation isolation system that was developed during the Ebola crisis.\n\nAnd then in addition to that, we're -- because that's a limited capacity, we're working with scientists around the Air Force and Defense Threat Reduction and NASA and some others to really study the aircraft circulation flow and implications of the movement of those particulates and -- and potential impacts on crews so that we can indeed move COVID-positive patients and passengers without an isolation unit while -- while adequately protecting the crew.\n\nAnd we think we're making some progress there. It's a great question, thank you.\n\nSTAFF: Okay, for the last question we'll go to Theresa with Breaking Defense.\n\nQ: Thank you, but I'm going to pass since Courtney asked my questions.\n\nQ: A small follow up --\n\nSTAFF: Okay, I've got one last small follow up from Fox and then we'll -- we'll cut it off.\n\nQ: General, you mentioned bringing some Americans home from Nigeria. I was wondering, is that a military aircraft that's going to be bringing them home?\n\nGEN. LYONS: No, that'll be a commercial aircraft. Almost exclusively, I see us using U.S. flag commercial passenger airlines, the ones we use everyday, frankly, to move troops for the most part; we'll use those to support the repatriation effort.\n\nQ: So you guys are like the Army Corps of Engineers from the air, and you contract the air mostly?\n\nGEN. LYONS: We do. We have regular providers that are in the civil reserve aviation fleet, if you would, probably about 25 or 26 providers, and they provide commercial augmentation, both in day-to-day operations and then of course we would mobilize them if needed in a -- in a conflict.\n\nAnd so we use those (inaudible) for the State Department mission.\n\nSTAFF: Okay.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Over.\n\nSTAFF: Thank you very much for your time today, sir. Thanks for going a little bit over. I think we have most of the questions answered. If you have some lingering questions that you need answered, please send them to our duty officer and we'll do what we can to get you some responses. That's all for now. Out of here.\n\nGEN. LYONS: Okay. Thanks, everybody, have a great day.\n\nhttps://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2132440/"

Keep the water you’ve cooked potatoes or pasta in. It will help the bread’s texture and rise. — Nigella Lawson (@Nigella_Lawson) March 26, 2020\n\nBaking products in general had been snapped up by consumers as they prepared for the lockdown, Foodstuffs head of corporate affairs Antoinette Laird said.\n\nThis could be because people had time to create their best and brightest baking sensations.\n\n\"Our suggestion is customers focus on working through the baking items they have in their cupboards and give the supply chain a bit of a chance to get back up to normal levels.\"\n\nA temporary mechanical breakdown at the Mauri Wellington Mill had halted production but general manager Steve Pedersen said the issue had been fixed and production was up and running.\n\nHe said their people were working extremely hard to restock supermarket shelves across New Zealand.\n\n\"We realise the importance of baking in the current environment and will continue to do our upmost to ensure ongoing supply to New Zealand's retailers.\"\n\nFarmers Mill flour mill in Timaru had used about four years worth of their smaller 5kg flour bag packaging in just a few weeks, business development manager Rebecca Biggs said.\n\nTheir mill didn't sell a large amount of retail flour with most of their flour supply going to in-store bakeries.\n\nThis supply was not disrupted as they received 20kg bags, but demand had increased for those bags as well.\n\nShe was aware of a few stores that had put the 20kg bags out on the floor so customers had the option of purchasing them.\n\nTheir packaging was made at a plant in Auckland and the earliest they could get more 5kg bags was six weeks away."

Jim, the floor is yours.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [3]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you, Chris, and thank you for joining us today for Calyxt's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results Conference Call.\n\nCalyxt is a technology company focused on delivering plant-based solutions that are healthy and sustainable. We're focused on health and wellness benefits for consumers, including better-tasting plant proteins, gluten-free alternatives, heart health, higher fiber and reduced allergens. Our product development efforts are also focused on sustainability benefits, including projects in alfalfa, hemp, potatoes and soybeans.\n\nTALEN technology, which powers our innovation platform, enables us to produce plants with desired characteristics that can benefit people and planet. Our gene-editing and plant-breeding techniques mimic how plants could develop in nature. We can assess the viability of a trait in less than 2 years, with another 3 to 4 years required for commercialization, all at a significantly reduced cost compared with traditional development methods.\n\nTo protect our market position, we have built a broad IP portfolio with over 70 patent families across multiple gene-editing platforms. We currently have 14 products in development and expect to launch as many as 6 product candidates over the next 4 years.\n\nA major highlight for Calyxt in 2019 was the completion of our voluntary consultation with the FDA for our high-oleic soybean. We were the first in the world to undertake this process, and we believe this validates our leadership position in the industry. With the commercial launch of our high-oleic soybean products underway. We have proven the commercial viability of our technology for use in plants. As we continue to innovate, we expect to bring future products to market with options for more diversified and higher-margin revenue streams, that are also less capital intensive.\n\nOutside of soybeans and wheat, we expect to bring products to market using a collaboration business model, enabling us to capture cash flows from access to Calyxt's TALEN technology. Milestone payments -- technology milestone payments as we achieve development success and ongoing payments from royalties or other streams tied to the value of the product development.\n\nBill Koschak, our CFO, will talk during his prepared remarks about how we expect to both expand on our margins on soybean products and how these new revenue streams will dramatically improve our gross margin profile in 2020 and beyond.\n\nBefore proceeding the Calyxt 2019 accomplishments, I want to touch on our ESG initiatives here at Calyxt. Sustainability is central to Calyxt, stemming from our commitment to innovation and our belief that by further -- by furthering environmental, social and corporate guidance -- governance initiatives, we will create a stronger company capable of improving the world and the lives of those living in it.\n\nTo that end, we are working diligently to create and report ESG metrics to improve our transparency with our stakeholders. Our ESG commitments will be based on 3 core Calyxt principles. The first principle is to successfully execute our core business while maintaining strong corporate governance practices as our business success naturally improves and revolutionizes agriculture.\n\nThe second principle revolves around environmental stewardship, where Calyxt seeks to make an impact by first establishing and then meeting Calyxt emissions reduction targets, and as importantly, by helping our customers and collaborators meet their targets.\n\nThe third principle is social responsibility where we support sustainable agriculture and fair labor practices and strive to improve the sustainability of our supply chain, foster a diverse work environment and give back to the communities where we live and work as we did with our Harvest Fest in South Dakota last fall. We look forward to reporting on our progress on various ESG initiatives as appropriate and would encourage our shareholders to watch developments on this front.\n\nNow turning to our operational accomplishments. 2019 was a transformational year for Calyxt, having launched our first commercial products and setting the stage for robust growth in 2020 and beyond. We have proven to the world that TALEN technology, which powers our innovation platform is capable of improving plants, enabling us to develop products with health and sustainability benefits.\n\nWe transformed our leadership, science and sales teams in 2019, bringing on several experienced, talented individuals to operate the business. The impact they have had is reflected in both the scientific and commercial progress we made. I look forward to working to achieve even greater successes with this group in 2020 and beyond.\n\nWe are a technology company and 2019 saw us make multiple advances in our scope of activity and work processes. We more than doubled the number of projects we have in development to 14, up from 6 at this time a year ago. We expanded the number of crops we are working in to 9, up from 5 a year ago. And we expect to launch at least 6 product candidates by 2024, and I am excited to announce today that we expect to launch our first product in hemp later this spring.\n\nIn our work processes, we made a 50% improvement in the assembly time to make a TALEN construct and we've cut plant growth cycles in half. Under the leadership of Dan, Travis and Bobby, we expect this meaningful progress to continue.\n\nI am also pleased to report that we met our financial metrics for the year. We sold all of the HO soybean meal we produced. And at year-end, we had a small quantity of oil on hand. We have a robust crush plan in place for 2020, and we expect -- that we expect will enable us to meet customer demand as 2020 unfolds. Our high oleic soybean products have a robust sales funnel and is being tested by multiple customers. The oil orders we received in early 2020 are a validation of our HO soybean oil's capability and performance.\n\nTo meet the expected demand for our oil, in 2020, we have already nearly tripled our contracted soybean acreage compared to 2019 planting and expect to have a 25% market share of all HO soybean acres planted in the United States in 2020.\n\nWe've also built a supply chain to support the scaling of our business, working with 3 leading agricultural cooperatives on seed distribution, grain handling and grain processing aspects of the operation. All these activities give us confidence in our ability to meet the expectations of our customers, both current and potential.\n\nWith this, I'd like to hand the call over to our Chief Science Officer, Dan Voytas, for an update on innovation and our product pipeline.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDaniel Voytas, Calyxt, Inc. - Founder & Chief Science Officer [4]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you, Jim. As a founder of the company, I am amazed by the progress we make each year and especially with what we accomplished in 2019. I'd like to provide a brief overview of how our TALEN technology and plant breeding techniques work.\n\nThe first steps in our development process are focused on identifying a target site in the plant genome for the selected crop. Then we develop a TALEN, make the edit or edits and confirm the outcomes of what we expected. After we have confirmed the results, the plants progress through our development process, moving from the lab to a growth chamber to a greenhouse and ultimately to a test plot. We check for accuracy every step of the way. After the test plot, we grow and collect seeds from those plants, we validate them and then begin the commercialization process.\n\nAs Jim mentioned, we had many scientific highlights in 2019, culminating with our updated R&D pipeline. We increased the number of crops we're working on to 9, up from 5 a year ago. We added hemp, oats, peas and peanuts in 2019. We increased the number of products under development to 14, up from 6 a year ago. Our pipeline projects address significant challenges in their respective markets and create new opportunities.\n\nOne great example is our high-fiber wheat product, in which we've been able to deliver 3x more dietary fiber than traditional white wheat flour. We expect to launch this project as early as 2022. Outstanding achievements such as these give me confidence in Calyxt's ability to revolutionize agriculture.\n\nWe expect to continue making advances on projects in our development process in 2020. We expect to launch at least 6 product candidates from now through 2024, including our hemp product candidate in the second quarter of 2020, our high-fiber wheat product candidate as early as 2022 and 3 additional product candidates, either via our integrated business model or in collaboration with third parties.\n\nThis is particularly exciting as we continue to accelerate our efforts to develop rewarding collaboration agreements with industry-leading firms to bring our products to market in a high-margin, capital-light manner. We continue the commercialization progress of our alfalfa product, an improved digestibility alfalfa, expected to launch in 2021 through a collaboration with S&W Seed. We expect to collect a royalty on the sales of the seed, monetizing our technology platform in a capital-light manner.\n\nThis alfalfa product is an exciting example of what we're able to achieve as a more easily digestible alfalfa could mean a reduction in the water intake and methane output of dairy cows to produce the same quantity of milk. With this product, Calyxt will provide benefits to farmers, consumers and the world through economical, logistical and environmental efficiencies.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more about this and other sustainability products in our development process. I'm excited about our R&D pipeline and working to expand it along with others inside and outside our organization, advancing our technology and expanding our IP portfolio, enabling us to continually push the boundaries of what we previously thought was possible through TALEN. Through this, we will explore new target crops, traits, pathways and transformation methods.\n\nIn addition to our already disclosed products, we will continue to expand our pipeline to bring what could be blockbuster products to the marketplace. Some examples of products we are aggressively pursuing are in sustainable oil replacement, where we'd replace one oil with another more sustainable or healthier alternative.\n\nWe are working on nongluten alternatives in the areas of protein flavor, where we're exploring project ideas like improved-tasting plant proteins. We also have multiple projects underway in hemp, including several that enable us to leverage our plant breeding expertise to accelerate market introductions as no gene editing is required.\n\nIn summary, we accomplished much in 2019, setting the stage for an exciting 2020.\n\nI'll now hand off to our CFO, Bill Koschak, who will give an update on our high oleic soybean sales and marketing efforts as well as our financial results.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [5]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you, Dan. Our high oleic soybean oil has several characteristics that make it as good or better than any other premium oil in the market today including its fat content and polymerization levels. This includes other HO soybean oils. When we started out with our idea, we were fortunate to get an acre planted.\n\nWe have demonstrated that there is demand for our HO soybean products in the market today. As we scale our business, we have brought on several leading agricultural cooperatives to run our supply chain at scale, and we have expanded both our acreage and state footprints over time.\n\nWith the new soybean varieties we are launching in 2020, we will be able to access acres across 6 states. Those 6 states also represent 45% of the total soybean acres in the United States and a significant portion of the wheat acres as well. This creates room for us to grow both the market and our share. Our estimates of the high oleic soybean market in 2020 indicate we will have 25% of the planted acres, which we will expect give us a seat at the table with major vegetable oil users as they evaluate their purchasing needs.\n\nWe break the U.S. vegetable oil market down into commodity and premium oils to assess the target addressable market for our products. We compete in the premium oil segment, which in 2018, was nearly 15 billion pounds according to USDA estimates. A variety of oils, many of which are imported, comprise this portion of the market. Within the premium oil market, we intend to focus on 4 segments based on the quality of our oil and our ability to scale with large customers while working with others in the market.\n\nFood service, food ingredients, industrial and animal nutrition are our prioritized market segments. We estimate these 4 represent an 11 billion pound addressable market. Our oil as a value proposition in each of these 4 market segments, in addition to several overarching points of distinguishment, for example, our oil has superior stability, a clean neutral flavor and low polymerization. These benefits make our oil very competitive and versatile across our target market segments, particularly in food ingredients and food service.\n\nWe've developed a robust sales funnel and are sampling, testing and going through supplier approval processes with multiple customers. Through today, we've demonstrated customer success in the food service and industrial market segments and are in late-stage testing with multiple customers in the food ingredients segment, with supplier approval processes underway in multiple instances with large, widely known brands and companies.\n\nWe also recently received a series of purchase orders for future deliveries of our HO soybean oil as a plant-based alternative to synthetic fluids. These orders are from a new world-class customer that operates in all 4 premium oil target market segments, food service, food ingredients, industrial and animal nutrition. To enable the best probability of success, we segment further these prioritized market segments by customer type in food service and by product category in food ingredients, focusing our efforts to maximize results.\n\nWithin food service, we've achieved success with distributors who sell our products to their account. We also directly are pursuing large operators with a focus on those who fry extensively. Within food ingredients, we prioritized 4 market categories, salty and grain snacks, plant-based proteins, industrial frying and nondairy creamers. These categories are also where we have significant users of oil to provide benefits to their customers.\n\nTo other categories where we see near-term opportunity are baked snacks and roasting applications. The inclusion of a brand in this presentation does not indicate we have any existing contracts with the brand, are meant simply to show where we have opportunities. In summary, we represent a significant share of the HO soybean acres and with our focused approach to customer acquisition, we believe our oil is poised for growth.\n\nI'll now give an update on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results. Our press release contains a full discussion of the fourth quarter and annual results. We also filed our Form 10-K this morning. The fourth quarter was a continuation of our rapid pace of operational execution. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $3.8 million, driven entirely by sales volumes of our HO soybean products. Our HO soybean oil was 32% of revenue in the fourth quarter.\n\nCash used in the fourth quarter was $7.9 million, better than our annual run rate projection for 2019 as the operational savings, we projected earlier in the year, began to impact our spending. For 2019, we reported revenue of $7.3 million. HO soybean oil revenue represented 23% of the total.\n\nWe sold out of our HO soybean meal production in the year. Cost of goods sold in 2019 increased by $9.3 million, reflecting the cost of products sold in the period and adjustment to the net realizable value of our inventories that reflects the higher costs we have experienced at this early stage of commercialization.\n\nGross margin as reported for 2019 were negative $2.0 million or 27%. We also report gross margin as adjusted, which for 2019 was a negative $4.5 million or 61%.\n\nWe're providing gross margin as adjusted at this time because we believe that this non-GAAP financial metric provides investors with useful supplemental information at this early stage of commercialization as the amounts being adjusted, affect the period-to-period comparability of our gross margins and financial performance.\n\nNet loss for 2019 was $39.6 million or a loss of $1.21 per basic and diluted share as compared to a net loss of $27.9 million or negative $0.91 per basic and diluted share in 2018, driven by higher personnel costs, higher stock compensation expenses and negative margins associated with the launch of our HO soybean products.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2019 increased to a loss of $29.8 million as compared to a loss of $18.9 million in 2018, driven by increased personnel costs as the cost of commercialization in 2019 were largely offset by reductions in grain cost expensed as R&D in 2018.\n\nNet cash used in 2019 was $35.3 million as compared to $18.4 million in 2018. The commercialization of our HO soybean products, including investments in personnel and purchases of grain drove the increase in cash used during the year. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $58.6 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $93.8 million as of December 31, 2018.\n\nIn summary, I am pleased with our financial progress. We achieved more than $7 million of revenue and used less than $36 million of cash. Our investments in the team are expected to enable us to rapidly advance our pipeline and expand both our customer and collaborator relationships and bring future products to market.\n\nLooking forward into 2020, we expect to nearly double revenue year-over-year and use approximately $34 million to $38 million in cash. We are managing our cash position and spending such that I expect our cash position will be sufficient to fund our operations into mid-2021. We also expect to expand our gross margin, as adjusted in 2020.\n\nTo accomplish the margin expansion, we expect to sell our products at higher prices than we did in 2019, and we also expect to begin the optimization of costs in our supply chain as we scale production. We do not provide a reconciliation of gross margin as adjusted on a forward-looking basis as we are not able to determine, without an unreasonable effort, the 2020 adjusted gross margins because we are not able to determine the amount of potential net realizable value adjustments to our inventories at year-end 2020.\n\nWith that, I turn the call back to Jim.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [6]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you, Bill. We're proud to offer products to our customers and collaborators focused on health and wellness benefits for consumers and sustainability benefits for all. Our pipeline advancements and commercial success set the stage for a breakthrough 2020, where we expect to power our R&D pipeline with new projects, processes and tools. We expect to initiate voluntary consultations with regulatory authorities and continue to advance products through our development process.\n\nWe also have multiple projects in hemp, including several that enable us to leverage our plant-breeding expertise to accelerate market introductions as no gene editing is required in this project.\n\nOur new hemp breeding program is set for commercial launch in the second quarter of 2020. What excites me most about this launch is that our scientific team was presented with a the challenge in hemp and was able to develop a solution, including the strategy, tools and work processes, in just a few short months, demonstrating the power of our technology platform and our team.\n\nWe expect to expand our soybean product customer base across our prioritized market segments, realize synergies in our supply chain and improve our adjusted gross margin profile. We also expect to develop and report on our ESG commitments and accomplishments.\n\nWe are an innovation platform and leader in our industry. We continue to drive execution of key operational milestones across R&D and our commercial activities and are regularly exceeding our internal goals. We have a first-mover advantage we intend to defend and rapidly capitalize on.\n\nWe will share more on our developing story at our upcoming 32nd Annual Roth Conference in Orange County, California and our soon to be announced Analyst Day in May 2020.\n\nWith that, I'd like to open it up, the call, for any questions.\n\n================================================================================\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [1]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Operator Instructions)\n\nThe first question is from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Joseph Baumgartner, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Analyst [2]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBill, just to come back to the 2020 guidance a bit more. I guess, I'm trying to understand the revenue, the outlook. I mean, the acreage is tripling year-on-year. You've announced more customers for the product. We continue the annoying commodity prices as well. So I guess, are more sales shifting into 2021? I mean, it doesn't seem to be a pricing issue? I'm just trying to bridge the uptick in raw materials in HO versus what you're going to actually book on revenue for this year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [3]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSure, John. To start your question, the -- remember, we've got a 1-year lag between acres planted and harvested and when we convert those to revenues. So the tripling is actually -- will be of revenue for 2021 not 2020, right? So we'll be doing a lot of revenue for 2020 will be geared off of the 18,000 acres we -- sorry, the 36,000 acres we had planted in 2019.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Joseph Baumgartner, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Analyst [4]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. And then on the...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [5]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on the strategy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Joseph Baumgartner, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Analyst [6]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. So there's nothing unusual in terms of customers or anything like that, it's just a simple timing of -- okay, fine.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [7]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSecondly, we did the -- we did -- John, we did the $7 million to $8.3 million this year off of the acres we grew in 2018 and prior. And our pricing and a number of other factors weighed in, changes in soybean prices and things like, what drive the range of numbers for next year, but it's all driven off the 36,000 acres.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Joseph Baumgartner, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Analyst [8]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. And then secondly, in terms of the thinking to the middle of the P&L, can you just maybe walk through your expectations for the split between R&D and SG&A in 2020? I mean, it looks like the underlying R&D run rate is closer to, I guess, $9 million, adjusting for the grain adjustments there. So how do you think about R&D, SG&A? And then also, any thoughts on working capital as well, to kind of get to that cash burn number.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [9]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes. So our -- sorry, our R&D number for 2019 was closer to $12 million, right? And there's no noise in that number. The comparability is affected by what went through the R&D expense a year ago. So I'd expect our run rate to be at that level. And as we gear up on some of these projects, that would be our focal point for investment in 2020 from an SG&A perspective.\n\nFrom a working capital standpoint, we learned a lot through the 2019 harvest in terms of how much grain might be delivered, what expectations were, how quickly we're able to convert it to cash, and we have a crush plan, as we mentioned in the remarks, that will allow us to burn through our current grain inventory with a high level of certainty in 2020. And then it will all be about how much of those acres that we are harvesting in the fall of 2020 that will drive the working capital need at the end of the calendar year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [10]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next question is from Ben Klieve of National Securities Corporation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenjamin David Klieve, National Securities Corporation, Research Division - Analyst [11]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll right. A couple of questions here. First, a follow-up on the 2020 revenue outlook. To clarify, the 18,000 acres that were harvested last fall, to what degree -- are 100% of those acres expected to be revenued in 2020? Or was there some that was realized in late 2019? Is there some percentage of acreage that is going to be harvested but utilized for R&D purposes or for demo purposes? How one-for-one is your harvest from '19 going to convert into revenue in '20?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [12]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks, Ben. Appreciate the question. I need to clarify. The acres we planted in 2019 were 36,000.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenjamin David Klieve, National Securities Corporation, Research Division - Analyst [13]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI apologize. No, yes. I just misspoke there. I'm sorry,\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [14]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo worries. So the 36,000 will be converted to revenue in 2020. The impact of samples and other things like that on the total quantity of product we have available for sale is not meaningful. If somebody wanted to do a large sample, we would likely -- not likely, we would sell them the oil. We wouldn't just give them a tanker, for example.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenjamin David Klieve, National Securities Corporation, Research Division - Analyst [15]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay, got it. And then, I guess, just to be clear, no meaningful revenue from the harvest in the fall was realized before the end of the calendar year. Is that correct?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [16]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat is correct.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenjamin David Klieve, National Securities Corporation, Research Division - Analyst [17]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. And then turning to 2020 acreage. I guess, first, just a clarifying question. You said that, that acreage was nearly tripling. You put out that press release a few weeks ago that acreage hit 100,000. Is contracted acreage at this point still 100,000 or is it north of there?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [18]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe announced that number about a month ago. And obviously, there's still time to contract acres. So it's continued to increase. We're more focused on our share of the HO acres in the U.S., which is a number that we're really excited about, having 1/4 of the share, based on our estimates.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [19]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut your point is a good one, Ben. We sold all the way up through past April 1 last year to reach our goal. And so just reaching our goal earlier told you a little bit about the demand. But we'll continue to look and support growers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenjamin David Klieve, National Securities Corporation, Research Division - Analyst [20]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGot it. Okay. And then last question for me and I'll get back in line here. How are you looking -- how are you setting the company up in advance of planting this spring to provide you with seed inventory going into 2021? And are you increasing that planted acreage more than your double -- your goal of doubling? How can you help us kind of understand what your outlook is for 2021 from a seed inventory perspective?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [21]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes. We are introducing -- thanks for the opening, Ben. We're introducing 5 new soybean varieties in 2020, which allows us to expand geographically and reduce our risk to weather, which was a real risk in 2019. But it also then allows us to multiply those seeds during the growing season in 2020 to expand further in our chosen geographies to improve the optimization of our margins.\n\nSo we have always said in our original business plan that we're focused on a plan that would double acreage every year and that's our public guidance so far.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [22]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdam L. Samuelson, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [23]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo a clarifying question just on the 2019 revenue number in the K this morning. You disclosed the revenue from meal of $5.7 million in oil of $1.6 million. And I guess, I'm trying to think about the mix of that in the premium kind of oil value that you generate. That revenue split would, I think, be below what you'd expect to generate, if you're just crushing commodity meal and oil. And I'm sensitive that you still have some carryover oil to be sold in 2020 and you're probably -- there were some trialing and sampling kind of volumes out there. But just help me think about the revenue mix there, just if you're kind of crushing, come out of a value-added oil, I would have presumed the revenue mix would be more skewed towards the oil versus the meal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [24]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks, Adam. The way we think about it in 2019 is that -- and this is one of our margin optimization levers as we look forward, is that we sold our oil in 2019 into different parts of the market, but not at the premiums we expect on a go-forward basis because we are more focused on making sure we didn't incur more costs as we are working to manage our crush plans and demand. So we believe we had to move the crop out so that our farmers could put new crop in the bins and all of that conversion so we weren't sitting on a large amount of inventory, resulted in the prices that we saw reflected in the reported numbers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [25]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI would add to that, that's one of the excitements around the 100,000 acres. We're finally at an acreage and oil supply contract that allows us to talk about bigger volumes with bigger customers on a reliable, stable process. And I would [chalk] 2019 experience up to startup.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdam L. Samuelson, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [26]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. So I mean, maybe we could -- I could circle up with this off-line, but I wanted to -- I mean, if I went -- I was going to go back and think about some statements you guys have made on earnings calls over the past over the past year, as you started to commercialize the high oleic soybean oil, kind of the messaging has been pretty consistent that you were getting premium values that you have been targeting. As what's the dissonance there?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [27]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's a combination of 2 things. When we were selling the oil to customers that we expect to on a long-term basis, we were getting premiums. When we were selling it to make sure we didn't incur additional cost and wanting to convert it to cash, we didn't get the premium that we've talked about.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [28]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExactly right, customer mix. And now it's established -- now it's establishment in the reliable supply, we'll be able to move to the top segment rather than the bottom.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdam L. Samuelson, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [29]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. That's helpful color. And then just more on a long-term basis, thinking about how you're laying out the product pipeline. And I think it's notable the word collaboration, it features considerably more prominently in that forward view today than it might have 6 or 6, 12 or 24 months ago.\n\nAnd I guess, Jim, I'd be interested in your thoughts on how -- maybe the learnings of having the value -- the fully integrated kind of product chain on the high oleic soybean has maybe changed your thinking in terms of collaboration versus integrated into the model, and how that has impacted your forward thinking on the business?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [30]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGreat question, Adam. I think we've been consistent in saying that, in the soybean market, we had to go farm-to-fork to proof-of-concept and control the supply chain. And we built a wonderful supply chain around soybeans that could also be utilized for wheat. So you'll see, over the past year, we've always talked about doing soybeans and wheat because they're diluting a fixed cost that we had or the system that we built, that we would consider doing those on our own, but would always consider collaborations with people in other crops and markets that had a go-to-market brand and our strategy and/or resources.\n\nSo I think it's consistent what you're seeing talking today is the fact that all the hard work of 2019 to build that soybean system will be useful for wheat. But now we're turning and pivoting to use the science to go into other crops, which, as we've said, will take us into collaborations with other companies that already have established distribution networks in these crops of markets, and we're excited to do it, but that's the difference between the last earnings calls and today: You're seeing finally say, yes, we've successfully built that soybean/wheat distribution system, and we're moving on into other crops and other collaborations.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdam L. Samuelson, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [31]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. Well, as just -- sorry, just maybe a point of emphasis there. And if -- why wouldn't you leverage the existing infrastructure and relationships you're building on the soy and wheat side to further develop additional traits and capabilities in those crops to sustain that franchise into the future? Why is the incremental investment not continuing in that direction versus -- I'm not saying that the investments in the other crops is a bad idea, I'm just trying to make sure I understand why. It doesn't seem like the future R&D is actually on soybean at all. And similarly, wheat. You have the high-fiber wheat, but after that, there's nothing else.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [32]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, that's a good point. In this call, we really talked about what we were introducing before 2024, and that's the difference. We continue to invest. We continue to invest in soybean. The easiest thing we could do is stack traits for more value at the same cost in soybeans, and we -- and you can rest assured, those are ideas that are kicking around for us.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [33]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next question is from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Food & Agribusiness Research and Food & Beverage Analyst [34]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes. So a couple of questions. One is, can you frame the potential opportunities of the products outside of high-oleic soybean oil? And can you put in relative terms too high oleic soybean oil, so we just get a concept to that? That's my first question.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [35]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSure. And so when we talk about that, we'll talk about the near terms mentioned on this call, which is hemp and alfalfa and high-fiber wheat in that 2024 period. So Bill, do you want to talk about the relativity?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [36]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSure. So from a -- I think what you'd see, Ken, and what we expect, certainly, is that as we move into a crop like hemp and while we were able to bring a product to market on the revenue in 2020 from that project won't be significant relevant to the soybeans, but it proves to people we can quickly get into that crop. And we'll -- as we talked about, we'll launch a number of other projects between now and 2024. Those revenue streams will be because we're going at it, all of them from those projects will be through collaborations. They will be lower because there will be likely the recurring revenues, but they'll also be very high margin.\n\nWe haven't provided a quantification, but from an alfalfa perspective we did lay out size of the market and our expectations for what we think S&W, our partner there, their market share would look like. And applying a royalty rate gets us to a royalty stream that's in the greater than $1 million a year, but less than $15 million a year. There's -- based on the size of the market and the pace at which they expand geographically beyond just the U.S.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [37]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo, I'm just going to add. We're planning on our very first year of high-fiber wheat in 2022. So just in that '24 horizon, we'll be scaling up. So as we continue to grow soybeans, the relativity of it is a great point. And I think you can see the relativity of it in that shorter window for an R&D company.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Food & Agribusiness Research and Food & Beverage Analyst [38]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. Let me just get the -- it was interesting, the first question is, if I think about how I think your revenues, if I -- can I use the proportion of 36,000 acres to this year. And then if I triple it, do I kind of put a relative -- can I do almost like a -- if this then that kind of analysis of, okay, that's what's going to be in 2021 based on 100,000 acres given the relationship between the 36,000 and the $50 million of revenue? And then do we add on top of that, some of these incremental opportunities? How do I think about that? Does that make sense?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [39]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, Ken, and that is a great way to think about it, is to take the revenue from this year based on acres and projected forward using what we've talked about for just soybeans. And then these other revenue streams would be incremental to the soybeans.\n\nOur goal is to get as any of those incremental revenue streams into our P&L over the next 12 to 36 months.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Food & Agribusiness Research and Food & Beverage Analyst [40]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. It is and then within that, though the profitability would go greater than that percentage just because as you are going into higher-margin products and becoming more efficient, so the relative improvement in operating profit will accelerate at a greater rate than the sales growth. Is that fair? Is that how to think about it?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [41]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Food & Agribusiness Research and Food & Beverage Analyst [42]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. And then my last question...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [43]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe will get margin leverage from things we will do in soybeans, and we will add higher margin revenue streams to it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKenneth Bryan Zaslow, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Food & Agribusiness Research and Food & Beverage Analyst [44]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. A lot of changes to management for the last, well, year or so. Is that done? Is there more to go? And how do you think about that? And do you have your team set now and is this -- can we assume that this is the team? Can you talk about that? And then I'll leave it there, please.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [45]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSure. A lot of 2019 and taking the first commercial product to the marketplace and this farm-to-fork model meant bringing in significant talent to build out whole departments. So you've seen us add several and we believe, enlisted them here in the release, but several key talents in to lead these departments and create the systems and all of the things that have to go with being a food and R&D in the ag company all in one. And we have -- I think we have a base group here that can take us to the next level. So the answer to your question is pretty much yes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [46]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next question is from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdam Samuel Bubes, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Associate [47]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi, this is Adam Bubes, on for Laurence today. I just have one question. I was wondering if you guys are seeing any delays in R&D collaboration discussions with peers, given the economic and coronavirus concerns. Or do you think the ag R&D community is fairly insulated?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [48]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI can answer your question upfront. We haven't seen any delays. We have business going on and have had and don't see any change from week-to-week so far.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [49]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next question is from Robert LeBoyer of Ladenburg Thalmann.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRobert Michael LeBoyer, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD Equity Research [50]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCongratulations on a nice quarter. My question has to do with the hemp market and introduction year. Are you going for the entire market, any particular segments, whether they're recreational, medical, industrial or you also discussed some of the changes that you've made to the gene editing, to the plant?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [51]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, 2 questions. We're focused solely on hemp in the ag use and the wellness use of hemp versus the other product in that family. And our first product has been done without gene editing or other projects on the board and what we're working on in the lab, likely will. And so that's where we're at today.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRobert Michael LeBoyer, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD Equity Research [52]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. And could you also discuss some of the changes to the oats, canola, peanuts, I think it was peas, those plants?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [53]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes. We haven't talked about the targets or what we're doing there specifically on those publicly. But with those crops, you probably -- can get an ideation of what we're working on around in those areas and looking at.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRobert Michael LeBoyer, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD Equity Research [54]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. And any revenue guidance on the hemp rollout? Or any metrics in terms of acreage or the type of things that you've laid out for soybeans?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [55]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNot at this time, Robert. Our expectations for that hemp product are included in the overall guidance for the company for 2020.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [56]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next question is from Steve Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Byrne, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [57]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes. Just wanted to continue on the hemp products you're developing it would seem that gene editing would be the key to adjusting all these various cannabinoids in that product and so it seems well suited to you. Are you developing relationships with pharmaceutical companies to develop these products that would then go through clinical trials? Or is it more likely going down the path of over-the-counter food products?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [58]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks, Steve. We're focused on the wellness aspect of it. But what we're learning and what we've learned quickly and which leads to this first product being in the market, is that we -- as we better understand how to cultivate and how to look at this thing on a genome basis, we have several opportunities, and we're keeping all of those open going forward.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Byrne, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [59]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd then on your high oleic soybeans, you indicated you have 25% of the acres. Is it fair to assume that the other 75% are the old transgenic products, this doesn't plenish, and just wanted to hear how you incentivize the grower to go down your path where you essentially give them a benefit on top of basis and buy the crop back from them, as opposed to the other route, where I don't really know how the farmer captures value on those products since there is they're basically on their own to sell the soybeans. How do you compare those 2 paths?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [60]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo, great question. Just to answer your first one, yes, the bulk of the other market share is held by those older products. How we're penetrating and what we're doing is we're bringing different value. So our growth rate is much higher than theirs. And one of it is due to the fact that we pay a premium to the grower that we're sharing from the food ingredient companies.\n\nBut one of the other ones is agronomic where theirs is GMO and still using some of the herbicide tolerance traits, ours is not. So for a farmer who's had experienced Roundup Ready crops and rotations for maybe 20 to 30 years, he's experiencing some weed resistance issues on his farm. One of the benefits to rotating to our non-GMO product is that you're using a different weed control system that takes out the resistant weeds and improves the value of your land. So many people are really excited about doing this and getting that benefit. Their landlords are happy.\n\nAnd secondly, because ours is not GMO, our seed is a lot less costly to buy. So when you think about financing a grower, and one of the first things he finances or buys is seed. Ours is significantly lower cost seed because we don't have the GMO trait in it. And therefore, the bankers and other people supporting the farmer are much happier because their financing cost for that crop are lower because of that specific thing, specific reason or should be as he analyzes how -- what crop he puts in the ground.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Byrne, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [61]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd then maybe just one more on that. So your 25% of the acres, but if I understood you correctly, you're capturing 70% of the high-value oil end markets in these 4 key end markets, do I have that right?\n\nAnd why are you able to capture so much more share of that? Is it the non-GMO oil having a benefit or an access to an end market that only your product can achieve as opposed to the transgenic route products don't have access to them?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [62]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteve, it's Bill. I'll take that one. The market penetration for premium oils is the 70% of the sort of 11 billion pounds of the 15 billion pound market size for all premium oils. Our share of that 11 billion pounds is obviously very, very small, as is HO soybean in total. And so what we're excited about is, as people look at what oils they could use in their products, the expectation is that HO soybean oil will become a greater share of the total market, and that's how we and others will all benefit, if you will as we look forward. So that's the tailwind that we're riding as customers evaluate oil options, they're trading off those transgenic HO soybean oils, perhaps, but they're also trading off high oleic canola or sunflower or one of those other premium oils mentioned on our slides, to look at soybean.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [63]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome of the reasons for the conversions are, people are looking at sustainability. So a local soybean grown here -- soybean being a great crop anywhere and crushed and used here locally is a lot different than some of these imported oils coming from Canada or the Ukraine or from Argentina. So that's also a reason for people switching and moving among the premium oils that are available now that we have the health profile to compete.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [64]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdam L. Samuelson, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [65]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust one quick follow-up, and it kind of goes back to Ken's question a little bit. So your '19 versus '18 acreage was basically double year-on-year, and you're talking about revenue doubling year-on-year. But you also said that in '19, you had not fully captured the kind of premium high oleic soybean oil price? So just wouldn't your revenue be up more if you're actually getting the full premiums in 20 versus '19? Or was the yield loss in your key growing regions, significant enough to -- that you just have notably lower production to our soybeans to process this year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilliam F. Koschak, Calyxt, Inc. - CFO [66]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGreat question, Adam. There are a number of factors that drive the year-over-year revenue expectations and yields are one, prices are another, both prices that we pay for the grain as well as prices we expect to receive in the market base wherever meal prices flow-through or oil prices for that matter. And we we're capturing premiums over the cash price or the board price, depending upon customer and product. So with all of those factors considered, that's how we arrived at our guidance for 2020.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [67]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Blome for his closing remarks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames A. Blome, Calyxt, Inc. - CEO [68]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. Just a reminder, we have a really dedicated and hard-working team here at Calyxt who really push themselves to further our mission each day. And I just want to give them a sincere thanks from all of the management, all of them. We certainly couldn't do this without them.\n\nAnd lastly, if we weren't able to address all of your questions on today's call, please feel free to contact us or our Investor Relations firm, which is MZ Group, who would be happy to answer them.\n\nSo we look forward to providing more updates on the next call and thank you very much for your time today. Operator?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [69]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."
