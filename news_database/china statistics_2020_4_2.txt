Read our guide to understanding New York on PAUSE, NY's stay-at-home order; a look at preparing for the spread of coronavirus is here, and if you have lingering questions about the virus, here is our regularly updated coronavirus FAQ. Here are some local and state hotlines for more information: NYC: 311; NY State Hotline: 888-364-3065; NJ State Hotline: 800-222-1222.\n\nAre you a healthcare worker? Email us what you're seeing at tips@gothamist.com.\n\n5:30 p.m. New York City hospitals will run out of ventilators on Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nDe Blasio has previously described Sunday, April 5th as \"D-Day\" for the city in terms of its need for critical supplies in the face of the escalating COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe mayor said he was hoping to receive 400 additional ventilators by that date from either the state or federal stockpile in order to be prepared for the week ahead.\n\nSince the crisis began, the city has received roughly 2,500 ventilators from the federal government and state. But de Blasio has said that the projections continue to indicate hospitals in NYC will need 15,000 ventilators to handle the growing flood of coronavirus patients.\n\nOn Tuesday, Governor Cuomo said the state had ordered 17,000 ventilators from China for roughly $25,000 apiece. Of those, 2,500 are expected to arrive in New York within two weeks, possibly past the city's deadline.\n\nDe Blasio on Wednesday also announced the appointment of former police commissioner James O'Neill as a senior adviser who will be in charge of the supply and distribution of medical supplies and equipment within New York City hospitals. Cuomo has asked New York City officials to work on a plan to create a unified hospital system that includes private and public hospitals.\n\n“Jimmy will leverage his extensive management experience and knowledge of the City to ensure that our healthcare workers on the front lines have the supplies they need to save New Yorker’s lives,\" de Blasio said in a statement.\n\nO'Neill retired from the NYPD in November and accepted a position at Visa as the global head of physical security. With Visa's permission, he has agreed to serve in a volunteer role with the city. He will maintain his job at Visa.\n\nTo date, the city has distributed more than 8 million face masks, 2 million N95 masks, and roughly 106,000 gowns, and nearly 2 million surgical gloves to hospitals, de Blasio said on Wednesday.\n\nCuomo Says Outbreaks Could Last Through Summer\n\nDashed Arrow Governor Andrew Cuomo / Flickr\n\n1:45 p.m. The coronavirus crisis could last through the summer, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths, according to various projections used by the state.\n\nNew York could see as many as 16,000 people die under one projection, Governor Andrew Cuomo said during a press conference on Wednesday. According to the same model, as many as 93,000 individuals could die nationwide.\n\nWhile New York is currently the epicenter of the crisis, Cuomo said that the virus will eventually spread to all parts of the country. On Tuesday, the White House released projections indicating between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die from the pandemic.\n\n\"Just as it has gone through rural New York, it will go through rural America,\" he said, referring to those who believe the problem was confined to big cities.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, there were 83,712 confirmed coronavirus cases statewide, with at least 1,941 deaths. Nearly 400 people in the state have died from COVID-19 since Tuesday.\n\nA composite model created by the consulting firm McKinsey is currently predicting that the apex of cases will come at the end of April. The projection could change as the models are updated with new data everyday. One of the factors that could help slow the spread of the virus is the use of social distancing measures.\n\nWith that in mind, after multiple admonishments to New York City residents over the last few weeks about close gatherings and team sports at parks, Cuomo announced that he would order the closure of all city playgrounds. The order would not apply to public open space.\n\n\"I’ve talked about this for weeks,\" Cuomo said. \"It is still a problem.\"\n\nHis decision comes one day after Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would close 10 city playgrounds for failure to comply with social distancing rules. In general, de Blasio has said most New Yorkers have been complying and that he wanted to keep playgrounds open so that cooped-up children could have outdoor space to play.\n\nCuomo said the NYPD needed to get tougher with enforcement.\n\n\"How reckless and irresponsible for people not to do it on your own?\" he added. \"What else do you have to know?\"\n\nNYC Surpasses 1,000 Deaths, CDC Considers Recommending Masks\n\nAs more research indicates that as many as 25 percent of people infected with coronavirus may be asymptomatic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reconsidering whether the general public should be wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCDC director Dr. Robert Redfield told NPR on Tuesday that it appears infected individuals are shedding the virus \"probably up to 48 hours before we show symptoms.\"\n\n\"This helps explain how rapidly this virus continues to spread across the country, because we have asymptomatic transmitters and we have individuals who are transmitting 48 hours before they become symptomatic,\" he said.\n\nHe later added that the issue of wearing masks \"is being aggressively reviewed.\"\n\nDuring a White House press conference on Tuesday, Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the coronavirus task force, said the issue of wearing masks is \"still under discussion.\"\n\nAs New York City enters the second month of known outbreaks, at least 1,096 residents have now died from coronavirus.\n\nThe city is now the epicenter of the crisis in the U.S., with 41,771 confirmed cases as of Tuesday afternoon, an increase of more than 1,000 over the previous day. Statewide, there are now more than 75,000 people who have tested positive for the disease.\n\nFrom the start, the CDC as well as the World Health Organization has maintained that ordinary healthy citizens do not need to wear masks, pointing to the shortage of protective equipment. \"Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers,\" the website currently states.\n\nThe issue has confused many Americans, who have watched people in other countries, especially in China and South Korea, don masks during the outbreaks. In New York City, members of the Asian community were among the first to start wearing masks even before there were known infections. But many pointed to cultural habits as the reason.\n\nOn Saturday, word that the CDC could change its guidance began circulating on social media.\n\nNEW: CDC guidance on masks expected to change in next 10 days. Americans will be advised to wear masks in everyday life. Current recommendation is for high-risk groups only. — Matt McCarthy (@DrMattMcCarthy) March 28, 2020\n\nThe following day, the Washington Post reported that CDC officials were thinking about changing its official guidance on masks, citing a federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBut a CDC spokesperson told Gothamist that the agency \"does not have guidance scheduled to come out on this topic.\"\n\nOn Monday, the WHO stood by its recommendation that average people not wear masks.\n\n\"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly,\" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.\n\nHe and other WHO officials also argued that masks should be prioritized for frontline healthcare workers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that people use scarves, which some experts have recommended in lieu of masks."

They use a smaller data set than the “official” PMI calculated by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). They are focused on private companies that are small and medium enterprises versus the NBS’ focus on state-owned enterprises. It is a good sign that smaller companies, which account for the most employment in China, saw a sharp uptick in March. Remember the calculation is month over month, so we are coming up from a dreadful February print. Regardless, it shows that China has gone back to work in a very significant way.\n\nKey News\n\nEastern Asian markets were off modestly until mid-afternoon. China and Taiwan were up for the day while US equity futures opened for trade and plummeted. The large drawdown in US equity futures immediately sent markets south. This has occurred a few times now in a discerning trend. Australia had a great day +3%. It seems it was spared the pain because it closes around mid-day Hong Kong time. Japan, Korea and India were all outliers to the downside. One broker noted that foreign investors have redeemed out of South Korea for 20 trading days in a row. Do they have any holdings left? If China is FIFO (first in first out), then South Korea is coming in second. Japan’s Tankan (PMIs) were awful sending equities lower.\n\nThe BIG news in Hong Kong was HSBC cut its dividend and suspended its buyback, sending the stock down -9%. HSBC accounted 187 of the Hang Seng’s 517 point loss. Another factor was Chinese auto maker BYD’s earnings missed expectations, which weighed on autos as a whole. The Hong Kong retail sales number we discussed yesterday was released after yesterday’s close, -44% year over year. Macau’s March revenues were released and off a mere -80% year over year in a surprise to absolutely no one. Smart phone maker, Xiaomi (1810 HK), reported what appeared to be strong earnings but was off -2.3% regardless. Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing (9988 HK) gained +0.33% after announcing it will be buying a stake in logistics/delivery company, Yunda.\n\nMainland China was having a good day until the US futures opened sending the market down into the close. The Caixin PMI rebound helped lift markets as well as government policies around electric vehicle subsidies being extended two more years and further support for private, small-medium enterprises.

They're heroes. They have skills in fighting COVID-19,\" McNeil continued.\n\n\"I don't see why we couldn't hire for our pandemic a lot of those doctors, nurses, and respiratory technicians,\" he added.\n\n\"The bottleneck I fear,\" McNeil speculated, \"is that the Trump administration is so afraid to admit that it might need help from outside, that it would refuse them visas, but again, that would cost lives, I think that would be a mistake.\"\n\nMcNeil went on to use \"reporting out of China\" to claim that Chinese President Xi Jinping offered Trump help during a phone call.\n\n\"I think it's not a good idea to keep insulting China and baiting them because if you look far enough down the road, President Trump may have to go to them with his hat in his hand, because we're gonna be able to design a great vaccine, but I don't know if we're gonna be able to run our vaccine plants if too many are sick,\" McNeil continued.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure, we may need vaccine from China, and they, out of anger, could simply say, 'sure, it'll be ten thousand dollars a dose,' and that's the free market working with you on the bad end of the stick,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't wanna face that,\" he concluded.\n\nMaddow offered no pushback on McNeil's claims.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. intelligence officials confirmed reports that China had misreported the numbers of deaths from coronavirus by purposely not counting asymptomatic persons who tested positive.\n\nHere's the Chinese propaganda segment:"

REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nThe comments came after a senior Republican lawmaker cast doubt on Beijing’s data and Bloomberg News said a classified U.S. intelligence report had concluded that China had under-reported the total cases and deaths it had suffered.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak began in China in late 2019 but Beijing has reported fewer cases and deaths than in the United States, which now has the world’s largest outbreak, with 214,000 confirmed cases and 4,800 deaths.\n\nTrump told a daily briefing by his coronavirus task force that he had not received an intelligence report on China’s data, but added:\n\n“The numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side - and I am being nice when I say that - relative to what we witnessed and what was reported.”\n\nTrump said he had discussed how China had dealt with the coronavirus outbreak in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last Friday, but “not so much the numbers.”\n\nTrump, who has toned down his criticism of China’s handling of the virus outbreak since the call, also said the U.S. relationship with China was “very good” and both sides wanted to maintain multi-billion dollar trade deal reached earlier this year.\n\n“As to whether or not their numbers are accurate,” he added, “I am not an accountant from China.”\n\nTrump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, told the same briefing Washington was “just not (in) the position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of China.”\n\n“There’s lots of public reporting on whether the numbers are too low,” he said. “You got access to those reports that are coming out of Chinese social media ... we just have no way to confirm any of those numbers.\n\nEarlier, Michael McCaul, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, accused Beijing of hiding the true number of those impacted. He said he had called for the State Department to investigate Beijing’s “initial cover up and subsequent actions regarding this pandemic.”\n\nThe Bloomberg report cited unidentified U.S. officials as saying that a classified report, received by the White House last week, concluded that China’s public reporting on cases and deaths was intentionally incomplete.\n\nChina reported dwindling new infections on Wednesday and for the first time disclosed the number of cases of people who have the highly contagious disease but do not show symptoms."
