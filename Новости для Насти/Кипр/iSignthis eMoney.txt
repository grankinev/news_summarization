Story 4
The transactions coincided with the end of the 2018 financial year after which 336 million performance shares would be issued to iSignthis BVI – the vendor company which became the basis of ASX-listed iSignthis as part of a 2014 backdoor listing.
The issue of the performance shares was linked to escalating revenue targets.
To meet the final of three milestones, iSignthis had to achieve a $5 million revenue target, which it did by a narrow $1,347 once the benefit of an R &D grant and interest income was excluded. The 336 million performance shares are now worth around $500 million, as the company's market valuation has soared in response to growing turnover.
'Neither confirm nor deny'
In response to e-mailed questions, founder and managing director John Karantzis said in Australia it was against the law to inform a customer that a suspicion has been formed or that a submission had been made to the financial intelligence agency.
For the same reason, he could not comment on the European operations and therefore could "neither confirm nor deny" questions relating to the KAB payments.
Mr Karanztis added that ”it would be suspicious for any regulated monetary financial institution to not file any suspicious activity reports”.

He added that Denmark's banks ranked second to Swiss banks in terms of credit ratings in 2018, and the highest in the European Union.
KAB, or Københavns Andelskasse, is a small co-operative with 19 employees, no branches and €41 million ($66 million) in deposits that has been at the centre of one of Denmark's largest money laundering scandals.
On Friday, Denmark's State Attorney for Special Economic and International Crime launched a formal investigation into the lender for breaching anti-money laundering laws.
Danish regulators conducted an investigation into the bank between June and August 2018 and found several serious issues, including deficient anti-money laundering (AML) controls and informed the police of AML violations.
The bank was taken over by Danish regulators in September 2018 and it is suspected that up to DKK4.1 billion ($900 million) was laundered through the bank between October 2017 and September 2018.
The Danish financial supervisory authority found the bank, which had 183 international customers, had 1645 alarms triggered with no action taken in the majority of cases.
The collapse of the bank had a significant impact on iSignthis and the "supply chain" disruption was cited as the reason for the sharp fall in revenue in the half ending December 2018.
Strong growth
Advertisement
iSignthis, which provides identity checks, payments and settlement services for online trading and gambling platforms, has since invested in its own network, to service a growing client base.
Since the company migrated customers onto its own payments infrastructure, it has reported strong growth in transaction volumes.
"We took the view that we should complete building our own network – so we own and operate our own tier 1 network – which we did in December that year, and we relaunched the same service to the same clients in the new year," the company said in responses to questions last week.
"If anything, revenue last year was on a less rapid rise last year than this year, as we were wary of using third-party networks to underpin our service."
Shares in the company have increased tenfold this year to achieve a market capitalisation of over $1 billion. On Monday, iSignthis was added to the S &P/ASX 300 Index.
But its pending entry into the index has attracted interest from investors and governance experts. iSignthis was the subject of a report by Ownership Matters which pointed to how the company achieved its 2018 revenue target and what it described as an "opaque" ownership structure.
The identity of the beneficial owner of the second-largest shareholder, British Virgin Islands-based Red 5 Solutions, remains a mystery.
iSignthis, however, has responded forcefully, publishing an extensive rebuttal to the ASX disputing the points raised by Ownership Matters.
Separately, Mr Karantzis is defending a Supreme Court dispute with an early investor over share entitlements. iSignthis BVI is also named in the proceedings brought by David Edmonds and his investment company, Larkspur Tribeca.

Story 6
Melbourne, Australia, Sep 16, 2019 - (ABN Newswire) - iSignthis Ltd (ASX:ISX.AX - News) (HAM:TA8.F - News) subsidiary, 'ISX IP Ltd' has been notified of the European Patent Office's ("EPO") intention to grant patent number EP2553642 'Methods and Systems for Verifying Transactions'. The patent will be granted across all 38 EPO member states, including all EU member states and Turkey.
Key Points
- European Patent Office (EPO) has issued notice of intention to grant patent across more than 38 countries
- Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) compliance day was 14th September 2019
- Patent includes methods for SCA and Know Your Customer (KYC)
- iSignthis Patents augment 3DSecure Version 1 for compliance to PSD2 SCA
- iSignthis SCA already incorporated into Paydentity(TM), ISXPay(R) and Probanx(R)
The notice of intent to grant patent coincides with the European Union's Directive requiring Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) under the Payment Services Directive 2 for i) cards and ii) access to account services, effective from the 14th September 2019. Many national regulators have recently extended the effective date for cards SCA by up to 18 months due to the difficulty faced by the payments industry in implementing an effective SCA process. Whilst the card schemes have been advocating the use of EMV Co's 3DSecure Version 2, the payments industry in the EU has not been prepared for the 14th September date, leading to the extension by EU national regulators.
The patent provides a means for iSignthis to independently achieve compliance with the European Banking Authority's (EBA) Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) on SCA, and authentication approaches outlined in the EBA's June 2019 opinion.
Consumers purchasing electronic money from our European Economic Area Authorised Monetary Financial Institution, iSignthis eMoney Ltd ("ISEMEE") subsidiary, will have available to them several means of authenticating their payment, allowing for a seamless consumer experience that in most cases will also meet the customer due diligence or KYC requirements at the same time.
ISEMEE thus has flexibility in its approach to SCA, including i) use of 3DSecure Version 2 when it becomes widely available, or ii) overlaying its patented technology on top of the existing 3DSecure Version 1 to ensure that that is PSD2 SCA compliant, or, iii) using its patented technology stand alone to simultaneously perform both KYC and SCA, and on success storing the consumers card on file and subsequently initiating transactions from the stored card without the requirement for further SCA on latter transactions. This last method leads to a significant reduction in friction for our consumers, as SCA and KYC will be performed in a single step with far less online click interactions, allowing rapid onboarding to ISEMEE's www.Flykk.it electronic money service.
Open banking access is a separate PSD2 requirement from that of SCA for cards. Accordingly, Probanx Solutions Ltd has built its API Specifications based on European Standards and industry guidelines by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE). The primary API and the Contingency measure have been deployed by ISEMEE, allowing third party providers to access ISEMEE systems for payment initiation and account information services.

Story 7
Melbourne, Australia, July 5, 2019 - (ABN Newswire) - iSignthis Ltd (ASX:ISX.AX - News)(HAM:TA8.F - News) ("The Company") is pleased to announce that it has recently met with representatives from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), and advises that its applications are progressing well, and likely issued this quarter. Engagement with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) also continues on our Australian Financial Services License (AFSL).
The Purchased Payment Facility (PPF) Authorised Deposit Taking Institution (ADI) license type applied for by iSignthis eMoney (AU) Pty Ltd ('ISEMAU") has a specific advantage to the Company over a standard ADI, in that the Tier 1 capital requirements are significantly less than that of a standard ADI that offers credit and loans.
The ISEMAU wholesale neobanking model does not require or rely upon retail deposits, nor an ongoing requirement for wholesale capital to fund a loan book. In turn, this removes market pressures and risk experienced by standard ADI's and retail neobanks in raising and maintaining Tier 1 capital for loan funding.
Conversely, wholesale funds managed under custodial arrangements by ISEMAU can be deposited with standard ADI's in interest bearing accounts.
ISEMAU does not consider any existing or recently licensed standard ADI, or restricted ADI neobanks as being competitors to the Company.
The PPF class of ADI has only been previously issued only once before by APRA, to Paypal Inc (NYSE:PYPL - News). However, Paypal does not have account facilities with the RBA, and relies upon other ADI's to provide it access to the cards and payments networks.
The combined AFSL, ADI license and RBA account facilities are expected to allow ISEMAU to focus on its payment operations, custodial, indirect retail and wholesale electronic money PPF accounts.
iSignthis will finalise its application to be allocated a Bank Sub Branch (BSB) number upon approval from the RBA, such that its Flykk retail and ISXMoney wholesale electronic facilities are accessible to and from the Australian payments network.
The Card Access Regime under which iSIgnthis is a card scheme principal member is a separate regime to that of the ADI, and is regulated by the RBA independent of APRA.

Story 8
Analyst support
In response to questions on Monday seeking an explanation of the flagged transactions and why iSignthis elected to bank with KAB, iSignthis boss John Karantzis said he was prevented from commenting on the alerts. He added, however, that the media inquiries acknowledged that the company "had high turnover and volumes."
This observation was also noted by Patersons Securities research analyst Martyn Jacobs, who told clients in a note that reports were "supporting evidence of high transaction volumes and values, suggesting support for the revenues claimed by ISX during that period."
Mr Jacobs maintained his $2.07 share price target.
iSignthis, which provides identification and payment services to gambling and online trading platforms, told the exchange that it operates an extensive anti-money laundering platform and that it is "working with regulators to make sure it adheres [to] or exceeds regulatory requirements during this growth phase".
It volunteered that it reports key statistics on a monthly basis and raises suspicious activity reports with regulators when they occur.
In Tuesday's market update, iSignthis also said it had restated the accounting treatment of funds held on behalf of two clients whose own funds had been frozen by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
The clients in question are OT Capital and Trader Q, according to a report in The Sydney Morning Herald, which said ASIC was heading to court to appoint liquidators to the two firms.

Working with ASIC
ASIC obtained interim injunctions against the brokers in February 2018 and said in a statement at the time that their conduct was "misleading or deceptive and/or unconscionable."
iSignthis clarified that the merchants were no "longer active customers".
Late on Tuesday, a statement issued by ASIC said its inquiries had led iSignthis to decrease funds held on "behalf of merchants classified as current assets and current liabilities by $6.3 million to $2.3 million as at 30 June 2018."
The regulator stated that "off balance sheet accounting remains a focus area for financial reporting at 30 June 2019."
iSignthis had disclosed in its accounts that it moved $4.7 million off its balance sheet, after the freezing of funds meant they no longer qualified as assets.
iSignthis also clarified that the ASIC court action and freezing of funds had no impact on the company's profits and its net assets. It held $34 million of client funds on balance sheet at June 30, 2019.
Shares in iSignthis have surged by more than 10 times this year as its market capitalisation exceeded $1 billion. The stock was added to the S &P/ASX 300 Index on Monday.

Australian payments and customer authentication provider iSignthis is under the microscope of the country’s stock exchange over its business with the cryptocurrency, foreign exchange and binary options sectors.
Trading of the fintech’s shares has been suspended by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) following “volatility” in its share price, pending “enquiries” by the stock exchange and the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), the markets regulator.
iSignthis provides know your customer (KYC) solutions to financial services companies, including online trading platforms, and is authorised as an EU e-money institution in Cyprus.

Story 10
Melbourne, Australia, May 14, 2019 - (ABN Newswire) - iSignthis Ltd (ASX:ISX.AX - News) ("the Company"), is pleased to announce that, on the basis of its cash receipts and unaudited management accounts, that it has achieved a 'break even' position on a weekly cash run rate basis. That is, gross profits on the basis of cash receipts now exceed group operating costs and will be contributing positively to the Company's EBIT line.
Highlights
- ISX enters extreme growth phase
- Tier 1 operations commenced at scale late January 2019
- Break even run rate position achieved within 4 months of Tier 1 operations
The Company's MSF or Gross profit contribution from its current onboarded merchants now comfortably exceeds the $8.75m annualised operating cost base at the current processing and EU acquiring levels. The Annualised GPTV now exceeds AU$542m, when calculated against actual weekly processed funds.
The Company is continuing to onboard its backlog of merchants, with less than 25% of merchants that have been approved and contracted being currently onboarded to the network and active. Generally, individual merchant GPTV is also increasing on a week by week basis.
The above assumes that our contracted merchants will continue to transact and process GPTV with us at least at the current levels, and that the Company does not target any new growth initiatives including any new products, regional expansion outside the EU and Australia, or any further acquisitions.

Story 11
Melbourne, Australia, June 17, 2019 - (ABN Newswire) - iSignthis Ltd (ASX:ISX.AX - News) ("the Company"), is pleased to announce that it has now approved more than 150 reportable accounts(see Note 1 below). The focus this last month has been on more complex and larger entities, in sectors adjacent to our CFD/FX core markets. Onboarding of approved merchants continues at a pace driven by the merchant integrating to our API's, consistent with our guidance and expectations.
Highlights
- Company's patented AML KYCC system continues to drive applications
- More than 150 applications now approved and reportable(see Note 1 below)
- Paydentity also used to identify directors and beneficial owners for KYB
The Company's Paydentity(R) service continues to be the key commercial driver for new business applications, whereby businesses seek to utilise iSignthis' patented Paydentity(R) technology to meet their Anti Money Laundering obligations, and in particular their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) requirements for both onboarding end users/consumers and business partners. As an EU regulated entity, our Paydentity(R) AML process has been submitted to our regulators, and it forms a key component of our Australian regulatory compliance approach.
CDD includes identification and verification not only of the end user or consumer, but also of other businesses in the value or delivery chain. For example, iSignthis performs CDD on its merchants, and under AUSTRAC and EU rules, we identify and verify the Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBO's)(see Note 2 below) and Directors of each entity that we do business with, which is a part of our Know Your Business (KYB) process.
The KYB process must be employed by parties that stand in the value chain, between consumers and merchants, including iSignthis, and other regulated and unregulated entities that may provide payment, credit, buy now pay later, marketplace and emoney services. KYB is a requirement under EU and Australian regulatory requirements and is most often the slowest and most difficult component of new merchant acquisition. We utilise Paydentity to perform aspects of KYB, but also to allow us to Know our Customer's Customer (KYCC). iSignthis uniquely 'looks through' its merchant's transactions and identifies our merchants' customers to a CDD level, allowing both iSignthis and its merchants for whom it processes payment to meet their CDD requirements.
In Australia, Paydentity(R) meets the CDD requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Funding Regulations, allowing our merchants to benefit from our patented technology to take advantage of the Digital Safeharbour provisions, whilst we process payments on their behalf. The iSignthis KYCC process delivered via Paydentity(R) thus has the dual benefit of allowing our Fintech customers and merchants to comply with their AUSTRAC and/or EU regulatory requirements, whilst at the same time de-risking our own operations as we track money flow from the consumer through our systems and to the merchant.
Notes:
1 Under the terms of the Company's EU licensing, active accounts are reported to the Central Bank each month.

Story 13
Melbourne, Australia, Aug 8, 2019 - (ABN Newswire) - iSignthis Ltd (ASX:ISX.AX - News)(HAM:TA8.F - News) ("The Company") is pleased to announce that it has entered into an Australian Principal Member licensing agreement with the Asia Pacific Singapore based regional subsidiary of Visa Inc (NYSE:V).
The agreement allows the Company to act as a merchant's card acquiring institution, and process card not present (online/remote) payments and make settlements on behalf of the merchant from cards issued anywhere globally by other Visa Principal or Associate member institutions. The Company generates revenue from its contracted merchants by charging a percentage fee known as the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on the sale amount processed on behalf of the merchant.
The overall value of the card processing market in Australia was $748,110,632,702 in 2017 across all card schemes, with the majority of that value being in retail point of sale as card present transactions.
Visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments, with more than 3.3Bn cards worldwide across 200 countries and territories, and capacity to process more than 65,000 transaction messages per second.
Visa's mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, reliable and secure digital payment network that enables individuals, businesses and economies to thrive. In addition to the card issuance and acceptance network, Visa has developed a number of innovations to support new ways to pay.
Principal membership of major card schemes is a complex process, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) regulating card payments and access by institutions to the major card schemes, including Visa.
Each card scheme must then be licensed individually, which in this case included Visa's assessment criteria requiring the Company to demonstrate the following:
- Fraud and security controls.
- Corporate and ethics governance.
- Sound business practices.
- (Relevant) Business strategy.
- Business continuity.
- Information consistency and security.
- Information conciliation.
- Services availability
The Company is also a Principal Member of Mastercard, ChinaUnionPay, Diners and Discover in Australia, with similar memberships in the European Economic Area (EEA). The Company has commenced its Australian Tier 1 interconnect build out to Visa, Mastercard, Diners and Discover, and has built, owns and operates its own card processing network in the EEA.
John Karantzis, CEO of iSignthis said, "The Company is pleased to extend its principal member relationship with Visa into multiple regions, incuding the EEA and Australia. This agreement also paves the way for iSignthis to expand within the Asia Pacific region in due course, through its relationship with the Visa Singapore regional office."

On 17 May 2019 at the annual general meeting the company had taken up ten resolutions, 9 resolutions were passed and resolution 4 withdrawn, i.e. Resolution on Approval of 10% Placement Capacity.
Overview of the 4th resolution: Resolution 4 is related to the approval to an issue of additional 10% issued capital
Decision 4 related to the authorization to issue an additional 10% of issued capital over a 12 month period. To be eligible to seek approval under ASX, a listed entity must have a market capitalization of $300 million, or less and not be included in the S&P/ASX300 Index.
But as the company had a market capitalization of over $300 million, therefore became ineligible of the 10 per cent grant.
The CEO, John Karantzis addressed the shareholders at the AGM. On the financial front of the company, the chairman stated that the first quarter of the financial year 2019 saw significant progress in the company’s overall performance.

Further,The CEO speaking on the guidance stated that the actual average in gross profit (GP) margin was greater than 125 bps in the first quarter.

Other revenue streams contributed in the growth include e-Paydentity, Probanx, BBS, fixed fees, set up charges, transfer fees and FX fees. Cost base has increased to $8.75m pa for Probanx, BBS and new product initiatives. However, the contribution of ADI licensing remains negligible since the late 2nd quarter.

Regulatory technology company iSignthis Ltd (ASX: ISX) has announced that its Australian subsidiary iSignthis eMoney Pty Ltd has entered into a “card not present/online agreement” with UnionPay International (UPI), to act as a card acquirer of China UnionPay (CUP) issued cards.
The two companies will collaborate in their mutual plans of developing a smoother payments process, however iSignthis must still complete full membership requirements, including technical integration and certification before offering the service to merchants.
The deal allows iSignthis eMoney to contract, process, acquire and settle directly with merchants using its ISXPay service.
ISXPay provides online businesses a full range of gateway, risk management, risk avoidance and processing services for card transactions and alternative payment methods.
CUP cards story
CUP cards are being issued by banks outside of China, including Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa, with CUP being the largest card issuer in the world.
Most recent transaction data suggest that CUP has rapidly become a popular card in Australia with transaction volume for UnionPay growing by 28.8% year-on-year to US$14.95 trillion (A$20 trillion).
For its own annual performance, iSignthis says its revenue in the 2018 financial year was 363% greater compared to the previous year while quarterly revenue was 167% greater.
Meanwhile, cash receipts increased to A$2.63 million, which represents a 67.4% increase versus the March quarter of A$1.57 million.
Funds secured
Today’s news comes a day after iSignthis secured a placement of almost 69 million ordinary shares in the company at a price of A$0.145 per share, raising A$10 million before costs.
The capital injection was earmarked for iSignthis to further develop the direction of digital product range, aimed at any online business that has transactions taking place on their platforms, and more importantly, anti-money laundering regulated entities.
iSignthis recently applied to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for authority to carry on banking business as a provider of a Purchased Payment Facility (PPF Provider) under the Banking Act 1959.
The $10 million capital raising includes the capital requirements iSignthis anticipates will be required to satisfy the minimum prudential Tier 1 capital requirements for licensing iSignthis eMoney as a PPF Provider, a special class of Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) that are authorised to undertake a limited range of banking activities.

Story 18
iSignthis Ltd, a payment and identity verification technology company, announced this Thursday that it is one step closer to receiving its Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) license in Australia, by receiving third-party verification of its core banking system.
Through its subsidiary iSignthis eMoney (AU) Pty Ltd, the company has applied to perform certain aspects of banking as a Provider of a Purchased Payment Facility (PPF Provider) from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which requires an ADI license.
Asia Trading Summit – The Leading Investment Event in China
APRA requires all ADI license applicants to demonstrate a working core banking platform. To meet this requirement, iSignthis acquired the Probanx Coreplus core banking platform back in September of last year.
However, in order to meet the requirements of the APRA, all firms must meet the prudential standard CPS 234, which requires third-party verification of an operative and compliant core banking system.
Today, iSignthis has received reports from its auditors Grant Thornton Australia Ltd and its IT Security Auditors, Security Centric Pty Ltd, on the use of the Probanx Coreplus core banking platform. These reports have been submitted to the APRA.

CEO of iSignthis: Acquisition of Probanx Platform has Already Paid Off
In the statement released today, iSignthis suggests this is a key milestone for the company towards achieving its ADI license, with the Chief Executive Officer John Karantzis stating in an email to Finance Magnates that its investment in the Probanx Coreplus platform has already paid off.
“On the basis of the foregoing, the Company advises that its ADI application is progressing well, with only minor matters remaining to be addressed. The Company is of the view that the license issue remains on target for early Q2 2019,” the statement said.
iSignthis is a provider of an end-to-end onboarding service for merchants. It offers a streamlined payment and identity service, with its two main products being Paydentity and ISXPay. Previously, the company has stated that the “overwhelming majority” of ISXPay’s customers are contracts for difference (CFD) and foreign exchange (forex) brokers and market makers.
NAB Adopts “No Appetite” for FX and CFD Trading
Yesterday, as Finance Magnates reported, the company also announced that it had entered into a number of new agreements with card schemes and other parties, to combat the upcoming termination of its cooperation with the National Australia Bank (NAB).
According to the statement, which was made on behalf of its Australian subsidiaries trading as ISXPay, NAB will no longer process payments for forex, CFD, equities, remittance and binary options traders as the bank has adopted a “no appetite” position for these trading sectors.

Source: iSignthis
iSignthis Ltd (“the Company”), on behalf of its various Australian subsidiaries trading as ISXPay®, is pleased to announce it has entered into a number of agreements with card schemes (Tier 1) and other parties Tier 2 & 3) to allow it to continue to provide and ramp up its payment processing, clearing and settlement (“card acquiring services”) in Australia for all major card schemes, including Visa and Mastercard, as an alternative to its NAB arrangements.
The Company’s card processing arrangements are independent of iSignthis eMoney (AU) Pty Ltd.’s APRA ADI application, and services are expected to commence with processing of Australian merchants by Mid-March 2019.

The Company advises its current Visa and Mastercard payment facility (“PayFac”) agreement with the National Australia Bank (ASX: NAB) will terminate effective 30th April 2019. The basis for the termination of the agreement with NAB is the NAB’s revised “High Risk MCC Update” policy. The NAB will discontinue the processing of CFD’s, FX, Equities, Remittance and Binary traders (“AML regulated sector merchants”) under the policy as it has adopted a “no appetite’ position for these sectors.

In support of the Company’s own strategy to deliver to the AML regulated sector merchants, the Company has entered into direct (Tier 1) licensing agreements as a Principal acquirer with the following major card schemes; • Mastercard • Diners / Discover (anticipated go live late April 2019) • China Union Pay (anticipated go live late July 2019) • American Express (anticipated go live late April 2019)

The entire suite of card schemes will be available to qualified merchants (subject to ISXPay terms & card scheme rules) over the course of H1 2019. ISXPay also offers some 15 plus non-Australian dollar currencies for card settlement and acceptance.

The Company’s focus is on AFSL regulated merchants and market makers including CFD, FX, Binary and equities traders, where Paydentity™ and multicurrency operations provide a competitive advantage to the Company and our merchants. The technology behind Paydentity™ is patented and has now onboarded more than 1.5m persons to a KYC standard.

Qualified Australian merchants may also open EURO (€) denominated eMoney (EMA) IBAN accounts, with eMoney accounts available in other currency denominations, including USD$, GBP£, HKD$, SGD$, CAD$, AUD$ and CHF, by Q2 2019. Australian dollar denominated accounts will follow post successful APRA ADI licensing.

The Company will report on the size of its Australian book and contracted Gross Processed Turnover Value progressively and separately to its EU GPTV book. As contracted GPTV converts to actual processed GPTV, the Company will then report on processed GPTV volume. The Company’s Sydney and Melbourne sales teams will also be seeking out other merchant categories as opportunity arises.

Recent GPTV update (Source: ISX’s Report)
The company has maintained the current EBIT guidance for FY2019 of $10.7 million.
Appointments and Agreements
On 31 July 2019, ISX onboarded a new Group CFO, Ms Elizabeth Warrell. This had the company in focus, with the industry experts impressed with the company’s performance and this recent appointment, as Ms Warrell has served as a National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB) executive, as a General Manager Finance, Consumer Banking and is expected to benefit ISX with her expertise of over 20 years in the banking and financial services experience in Australia and internationally.
Besides this, ISX entered into an Australian Principal Member licensing agreement with the Asia Pacific based regional subsidiary of Visa Inc (in Singapore), which would enable the company to act as a merchant’s card acquiring institution, process the virtual and remote payment mechanism and conduct settlements on account of the merchant from cards which would be issued across the world by different Associate member institutions or Visa Principal.
As per the usual norm, ISX would generate revenue via the percentage fee known as the Merchant Discount Rate on the sale amount processed on behalf of the merchant.
ISX has been on top of the charts when it comes to such memberships, and is a principal member of Mastercard, Diners & Discover in Australia, China UnionPay and likewise associations across the European Economic Area as well.
FY2019 Q2 (H1) Investor Update
On 30 July 2019, ISX provided FY2019 Q2 (H1) Investor Update, wherein, CEO Mr John Karantzis expressed that ISX is differentiated by its unique digital identity and banking services for both businesses and financial institutions across the Aussie land and the EEA.
Further, in its Investor update, the company notified that the AU$ Gross Processed Transaction Volume on the Tier 1 network had remained steady. The non-inclusion of new merchants had enabled the company to manually verify automated SWIFT inflow systems and begin card reconciliation and Merchant Settlement Systems verification. Moreover, ISX had begun the existing merchant annual KYB/KYC cycle.
What is driving investors towards ISX?
Considering all that is going well for the company, industry experts believe that ISX could be the next neobank to compete with the well-established banks and financial service providers in Australia, with its uniqueness, tech-savvy and prompt approaches. The share price of the company has more than doubled in just a year (approximately 255%) with the share price up by approximately 87% over the last quarter. To support this uptrend and growth traction for ISX, its shareholders have increased by approximately 178% in the last three years, depicting that investor sentiment has been well taken care by ISX.
After the release of its 1H19 results, ISX’s profitability is expected to improve significantly in the second half, in adherence to the robust guidance, which would be likely supported by the strong Gross Processed Turnover Volume growth, increasing approvals and merchant service fees. Moreover, Ms Warrell’s inclusion as CFO bears potential to take ISX to an altogether new level.
Besides this, the concept of neobanks is attaining global attention, and ISX has been rising within the payment authentication and neobanking space. What’s attracting investors is the continued growth in the Australian payments sector and the key partnerships, along with a positive cash flow, positioning ISX in a secure radar, amid whispers of recession and a projected global downtrend.
Share Price Information
After the close of the trade session, on the Australian Securities Exchange, on 13 September 2019, ISX stock was last quoted A$1.020, whopped by 9.67%, with a market capitalisation of A$1.02 billion and approximately 1.09 billion outstanding shares. In the past three and six months, the ISX stock has generated returns of 40.91% and 244.44%, respectively, while its YTD return is of 520%.
Given the optimistic outlook and welcoming revert of the market and investors, it would be interesting to witness ISX unfold its activities and progresses in the remainder of FY19. We are committed to provide lucrative stock market input to ease decision making and analysis process of investors and encourage you to stay tuned to this space to read more about ISX and other players.

Regulatory technology company iSignthis Ltd (ASX: ISX) has declared that it has completed its previously-announced Tier 1 integration that allows direct access to both Visa and Mastercard payments in the European Union (EU).
The news means iSignthis will be able to process Visa and Mastercard card transactions for some of the world’s leading retail trading companies in Europe with greater ease, and importantly, paves the way for greater commercial traction for its suite of regulatory technology (RegTech) products offered to businesses.
iSignthis provides an end-to-end onboarding service for merchants, with a unified payment and identity service, dubbed Paydentity and ISXPay leading its suite of products.
The company’s overarching plan is to become the global RegTech leader in remote identity verification, payment authentication with deposit-taking, transactional banking and payment processing capabilities being offered to a growing number of companies – especially small and medium-sized businesses.
Future payments expansion
Looking forward, iSignthis plans to add further payment channels including Diners, Discover, China UnionPay and Amex that “will further augment ISXPay’s offering and revenues from mid CY/FY2019, and positions the company with a globally enviable choice of payment channels and capabilities,” the company said.
iSignthis has previously announced that it contracted more than A$880 million of merchant gross processed turnover volume (GPTV), to be processed in the forthcoming year with ISXPay expected to ramp up merchant volumes – without the restrictions it previously faced working with other payment service providers.
As it stands, the RegTech provider said it expects that GPTV will gradually be loaded to ISXPay over the course of January 2018 and forecast to be at full GPTV monthly throughput by March 2019.
Furthermore, iSignthis has restated its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) guidance, which now stands at A$10.7 million for next year.
To provide further insight into its regulatory-focused business model, iSignthis has said that the “overwhelming majority” of ISXPay’s customers are CFD/FX brokers and market makers – financial companies that offer retail trading services to clients across the world.
These firms are particularly attracted to Paydentity given their need to conduct identity checks and repeated deposits (often at very short notice) while complying with strict compliance requirements set forth by regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and ASIC.
Paydentity currently allows deposits to be made in over 150 different currencies and allowing clients to settle their European-bound transactions in Euros.
Earlier this month, iSignthis signed an eCommerce acquiring business agreement with Diners Club International allowing its Australian and European-based subsidiaries to acquire Diners Club and Discover Network branded cards directly, as an online Tier 1 acquirer.
The agreement allows iSignthis to acquire all types of online and eCommerce merchants, including quasi-cash and gambling merchants.
“The addition of the Diners Club and Discover Network to our card acquiring services means that we now have agreements with all the major, global card schemes. We are excited to be working with Diners and Discover and extending card the reach of their card acquiring services into the European Union, Australia and other territories, as we grow,” said John Karantzis, CEO of iSignthis.
Asian market status
In addition to its European market progress, iSignthis is also trying to pick up merchant clients in Asia.
Just last month, iSignthis announced that its Australian subsidiary iSignthis eMoney entered into a “card not present/online agreement” with UnionPay International (UPI), to act as a card acquirer of China UnionPay (CUP) issued cards.
The two companies have struck a deal to collaborate in their mutual plans of developing a smoother payments process, including technical integration and certification before offering the service to merchants.
The deal allows iSignthis eMoney to contract, process, acquire and settle directly with merchants using its ISXPay service.
This morning’s news helped iSignthis shares to gain almost 4%, to trade at $0.145 per share.

Recent price action at a glance
iSignthis Limited (ASX: ISX) saw its share price soar yesterday, after announcing that its transaction volumes exceeded A$1.1bn for the first time.
The market reaction was evidently bullish, with the iSignthis share price being bid some 14% higher during yesterday’s trading session.
Such sentiment has flowed into today’s session, with the company’s shares rising another 11%, as of 14:10 AEST.
This caps off an extraordinary year for iSignthis: since January the young company has seen its share price skyrocket from just A$0.16 to $1.74 per share – a gain of roughly 946%. Including today's 11% gain, this figure has risen to around 987%.
iSignthis share price: the bull story in focus
iSignthis Limited (ASX: ISX), the dual-listed fintech player looks to be following in the footsteps of market darlings Afterpay and other tech-focused growth stocks.
iSignthis, summarising its own business model, is chiefly involved in the deliverance of:
‘Remote identity verification and payment authentication coupled with emoney, transactional banking, IBANisses and payment processing capability.’
Indeed, besides the impressive share price gains outlined above, the fast-growing small-cap has seen a number of its operational metrics exponentially rise in recent times.
In the company’s half-year report for example, iSignthis reported that ‘annualised monthly GPTV at the end of July came at A$830m.’
Following up on this, the catalyst behind yesterday’s 14% run-up looks to be another strong uptick in volumes processed, with the company announcing that its ‘annualised monthly GPTV’ figures exceeded A$1.1bn, as of June 30.
Importantly, investors should not confuse GPTV with revenue. Afterpay, for example, often refers to the transaction volumes processed through its platform as ‘underlying sales’.
As iSignthis clearly points out: GPTV represents 'the volume of funds processed by the Company on behalf of any of its Merchants.’
Traditional financial metrics also gain
iSignthis Limited’s more traditional financial metrics also posted solid gains during the first-half of 2019.
Here, the company reported total revenues of A$8.2m (up 48% from the prior corresponding period). iSignthis lost just A$0.7m for the half.
The company currently has approximately A$13.0m cash on hand.
In addition to this, one of ISignthis’s’ strengths can be summarised by the fact that the company:
‘Delivers regulatory compliance to an enhanced customer due diligence standard, offering global reach to any of the world's 4.2Bn 'bank verified' card or account holders.’
iSignthis, though reporting only A$8.2m in total revenue, currently has a market capitalisation of A$1.71bn.
iSignthis partners up with VISA
Finally and maybe one of the biggest drawcards to investors, was the August announcement that iSignthis Limited (ASX: ISX) had entered into a licensing agreement with a Singapore-based subsidiary of payments giant VISA.
Here, the young company commented that as part of this partnership, iSignthis will be allowed 'to act as a merchant's card acquiring institution, and process card not present (online/remote) payments and make settlements on behalf of the merchant from cards issued anywhere globally by other Visa Principal.’
Coincidentally, Afterpay Holdings Limited another fast-rising ASX-listed fintech, in its FY19 report also announced that it had entered into a partnership with VISA, with the aim of facilitating ‘future expansion and platform innovation in the US.’
Ultimately, with such impressive share price momentum YTD, it will be interesting to see if iSignthis can maintain this trajectory going forward.
Only time will tell.

Story 23
iSignthis Limited (ASX: ISX), headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, is listed on Australian Securities and Frankfurt Stock Exchange (ASX: ISX | FRA: TA8). The company has an operations center in Nicosia, Cyprus, and regional offices across Europe. The company is engaged in remote identity verification, payment authentication, and payment processing providing an end-to-end onboarding service for merchants.
ISX subsidiary, iSignthis eMoney Ltd (ISXPay) announced its first EU merchant going live today. It has its own integrated and unified neobanking platform which comprises a principal acquiring platform for Visa, Mastercard, Diners, Discover, (China) Union Pay International, and JCB International, an American Express aggregator. [optin-monster-shortcode id=”swikrbu1d9j9aq0o4cko”]
It provides merchants with access to payments via alternative methods including SEPA, Poli Payments, Sofort, Trustly, WeChat, AliPay, and others. The fund settlements will be deposited to ISXPay issued ISEMCY22 International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs). On 5 December 2018, ISX accepted deposits on behalf of customers to its own issued IBANs.
It is the first ASX listed fully authorized EU neobank with deposit taking & payment capabilities
The Company is consistently progressing its capabilities since 2015, initially starting with Paydentity platform, and then advancing to be an EU/EEA authorised eMoney Institution in early 2017, followed by principal licensing of Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Diners, Discover, China UnionPay and AMEX as payment capabilities, with Euro-system central banking facilities and SEPA going live in the last two weeks.
The Company has also applied for an Australian ADI license directly with APRA authorization anticipated in early Q2 2019.

iSignthis Aims to Perform Certain Banking Functions Like PayPal
Recently, the firm applied to perform certain aspects of banking as a Provider of a Purchased Payment Facility (PPF Provider) from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) for its subsidiary iSignthis eMoney (AU) Pty Ltd (“ISEMAU”). Its license is still currently under review by the regulator.
Suggested articles How Trading Conditions Can Affect a Trader’s PerformanceGo to article >>
According to the statement released by the company, it will use the capital to satisfy the minimum Tier 1 capital requirements to secure the license as a PPF Provider. A PPF Provider is a special class of an Authorized Deposit-taking Institution (ADI), an institution that is allowed to perform a limited range of banking activities.
iSignthis expects the conditions for the license to be similar to what was expected of Paypal Australia Pty Limited, which is currently the only PPF Provider ADI licensed by APRA. However, the company states that its application may be subject to other conditions.
As part of the license, ISEMAU will directly process and settle card payments as a scheme participant under the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Payment Card Access Regime.
Recently, iSignthis has been expanding its reach not only in Australia – but across the world. In September, Finance Magnates reported that is has signed an agreement with Prasos – a cryptocurrency service provider in Finland. As per the agreement, Prasos will use iSignthis’ PaydentityTM to process payments and for identity verification services.

Stock Information
The shares of IT sector player iSignthis Ltd (ASX: ISX) have moved up a staggering 9 times or over 800% on a year-to-date basis, while the YTD returns for S&P/ASX 200 Information Technology (Sector) and S&P/ASX 200 stands at 32% and 17%, respectively. Since 6 February 2019, the company’s share price has been trending in the upward direction. On 6 September 2019 (AEST 12:21 PM), the share price of ISX was trading at AUD 1.415, up 2.536% or AUD 0.035 from its previous closing price. The company has a market cap of AUD 1.51 billion and approximately 1.09 billion outstanding shares.
As compared to much bigger players in the same field, ISX is providing a better return. ISX is a principal member card acquirer that is engaged in providing a safe, seamless and quick experience for customers as well as merchants. The company provides products that help in optimising the online payment user experience. Its services cater an overall end customer onboarding solution, remote identity verification, payment processing, card acquiring, settlement, SEPA transfers, IBAN accounts as well as deposit-taking E-Money services. The company also provides regulatory compliance to enhance the customer due diligence level for its business clients via its KYCC platform, Paydentity™. KYCC stands for know your customer’s customer. This platform is used for verification of ownership of cards as well as accounts. It also gives a basis for EDD KYC compliance, delivers high conversion rates, as well as verifies ownership of all card types from all major card schemes such as American Express, VISA, and China Union Pay.
Its payment platform, ISXPay® helps merchants to accept and process payments online from customers across the world. By combining the unified Payment Platform of ISX, ISXPay®, the merchants are able to accept all kinds of major cards along with several alternative and domestic payment methods.
These products offer an advantage to iSignthis over its peer group players like Afterpay Touch Group Limited (ASX: APT), which was recently under limelight when the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) ordered an audit of its anti-money laundering/ counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) compliance.
Let’s take a look at the company’s major achievements in 2019, so far.
1H 2019 Highlights
Total audited operating revenue of the company in the first half of 2019 ended 30 June 2019 stood at AUD 7.5 million, up by more than 49% from AUD 5 million recorded during the previous corresponding period (pcp). The company’s total income along with other income for the period was AUD 8.2 million, representing an increase of 48% from AUD 5.5 million in the same period a year ago. The statutory loss for the period declined by 75% to AUD 0.7 million on pcp.
The balance sheet of ISX witnessed an increase in net assets from AUD 11.44 million in 2H 2018 to AUD 12.87 million in 1H of 2019. Also, the company’s debt to equity ratio is 3.027, which means that the company used more debt to fund its business in the reporting period.
ISX was able to attain its positive cash flow position by the mid of May 2019. The company used AUD 282,743 in its operating activities and AUD 85,933 in its investing activities. The net cash generated through financing activities was AUD 1.75 million. The position of cash and cash equivalents of ISX by the end of 1H 2019 stood at AUD 9.9 million.
Major ISX Developments since January 2019
On 2 January 2019, around 1,208,936 fully paid ordinary shares were issued by the consolidated entity upon the vesting of performance rights. On 15 February 2019, ISX completed the acquisition of UAB Baltic Banking Services. The initial purchase price for the acquisition was EUR 75,000 along with fully paid ordinary shares in the consolidated entity worth EUR 75,000. Moreover, an earn out was also linked to this acquisition, on the basis of a multiplier of EBIT as at 31 December 2019 minus the initial payment, capped at EUR 1.5 million. The consideration was paid as 85% in the form of fully paid ordinary shares with a majority escrow provision, while the remaining 15% was the cash component.
Operational Trading Update
Position of the actual annualised monthly gross processing transaction value (GPTV) as on 31 July 2019 stood at AUD 830 million. It represented a 96% increase in the value post the completion of 1H 2019. From the EU Tier 1 Network, the Merchant Services Fee (MSF) increased as per the expectations with new merchant onboarding along with growing processing volumes. By the end of July 2019, Group approvals increased by 14% to 240. This value comprises of 95 acquiring approvals and 145 e-Money Account (EMA) approvals. Apart from this, the sales team was able to build up a significant pipeline of merchant applications. These applications are being processed by the approval team or the underwriting team. The pipeline created by these salespeople would help in growing the eMoney and card services.
The company on 31 July 2019 announced the appointment of 20 years experienced banking and financial services professional, Elizabeth Warrell as its Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO). She has exposure in Australia as well as abroad, and in ISX, she would be taking care of the group’s financial, treasury, accounting as well as compliance functions.
Recently, iSignthis Ltd announced that it signed an Australian Principal Member licensing agreement with the APAC (Singapore) based regional subsidiary company of Visa Inc. As per this agreement, ISX would be acting as the merchant’s card acquiring organisation and process those cards that are not present via online/remote payments mode. It would also make clearances on behalf of the merchant for cards that are issued from any place across the globe by associate member institutions or other Visa Principal. The source of the company’s revenue would be from its contracted merchants who would be charged in the form of a percentage fee known as Merchant Discount Rate on the sale amount.

Story 28
The iSignthis Ltd (ASX: ISX) share price fell 34% today despite no news from the company.
Over the past month, shares of iSignthis Ltd are down 13% whereas the S&P/ASX 200 (INDEXASX: XJO) has risen about 1% in the same time.

About iSignthis Ltd
iSignthis is listed on the ASX and Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It provides remote identity verification and payment authentication combined with e-money, transactional banking, IBAN issue and payment processing capability. Its products and businesses are iSignthis Paydentity, ISXPay, UAB Baltic Banking Service and Probanx Information Systems.
What’s Happened?
iSignthis shares have been on a tear the past few months as investors swooped in on the company’s supposed ability to attract sticky clients and achieve significant long-term growth, starting with high turnover volume (GPTV) through its platform.
On Tuesday, strong GPTV growth led the iSignthis share price up 29%.
The problem is, as we pointed out earlier this week in an article titled, “iSignthis Shares — What On Earth…”, the company’s shares appear to be very expensive.
For example, during the most recent half-year financial reporting period, iSignthis reported revenue of just $7.5 million. That compared to a market capitalisation (the total worth of all shares) of around $1.6 billion.
The Australian Financial Review (AFR) aired an article which went so far as to compare the tiny, not-yet-profitable business to the $US120 billion (plus change) payments juggernaut that is PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL).
The AFR article, Why Australia’s answer to PayPal is trading up tenfold, quoted the CEO as saying, “We have gone a bit deeper into payments technology and agreements than PayPal, as we connect into central banks in Europe, the SEPA payment scheme, and we are a principal member institution of Visa, Mastercard, Diners, Discover, JCB, and ChinaUnionPay in Australia and the EU.”
I guess that some investors think if iSignthis achieves operational success anywhere close to that of PayPal, which has 290 million users, the valuation is justified?
Questions Raised
The seemingly endless share price growth and growth and growth coupled with positive news flow and coverage of the company has not been lost on some seasoned and sceptical investors.
At the weekend and in a note to clients, Claude Walker, analyst and Founder of Ethical Equities, said there were a number of issues or concerns about the company preventing him from seeing value in the shares today.
Walker said, “to me, ISX doesn’t fit the typical profile of a 42x revenue stock (and even that pricing assumes that growth increases 4x), but none of this means that the share price won’t continue going up.”
Adding, “plenty of people think iSignthis has a great story which in turn attracts more interest as the share price rises, which in turn seems to reinforce the story, and so on.”
What Happens Next?
No-one knows for certain what will happen next but one thing most seasoned investors know for certain is that it tends to be better to buy shares when sentiment towards the company is not at its highest.
Fundamentally, in my opinion, shares in iSignthis appear to be extremely expensive and prudent investors will be wise to leave this one to the traders.

Story 30
The iSignthis Ltd (ASX: ISX) share price is rocketing this morning, it’s up 13% in early trading.
iSignthis is listed on the ASX and Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It provides remote identity verification and payment authentication combined with e-money, transactional banking, IBAN issue and payment processing capability. Its products and businesses are iSignthis Paydentity, ISXPay, UAB Baltic Banking Service and Probanx Information Systems.
Why The iSignthis Share Price Is Jumping
The iSignthis share price has risen 18% in early trading after the company responded to an ASX price query relating to a significant increase in the volume of trading and the large price movement.
The company responded that it became aware of a report by James Samson and Dean Paatsch from Ownership Matters, which was reported in the Australian Financial Review by Yolanda Redrup and the Sydney Morning Herald by Colin Kruger.
iSignthis noted it wasn’t invited to comment on the report, which it said draws unverified conclusions which are inconsistent with public disclosures made by the the company.
The report also suggested that the ownership of iSignthis is opaque, which the company refuted because it has made all the necessary disclosures.
One of the main issues being highlighted in the media is that the report asserts the performance rights had revenue targets which were only met by a margin of $1,347 with revenue falling 78% after the hurdle was tested.
iSignthis explained that it was the collapse of one of its clients, KAB (a Danish bank), which caused the fall in revenue.
The fintech company said that the performance rights allegation was factually incorrect, as revenue includes interest and R&D grants.
iSignthis said that the relevant revenue figures were total annual audited revenue at June 2018 was $6,338,969 and the audited revenue for the six-month half to June was $5,512,057.
Therefore, as iSignthis said (and bolded in its release), the prospectus milestone targets for performance rights were met by $512,057 not $1,347 as Ownership Matters said.
The company went on to explain why the reporting dates were changed, which was in order to help the auditing and reporting requirements in Europe and match the audit periods.
iSignthis also said it will refer the matter and the conduct of Ownership Matters to ASIC.
What Now?
This is unlikely to be the end of the matter. iSignthis is likely to continue to be volatile due to the high level of interest and the growth rate the company is reporting.
iSignthis is not the type of business I’d buy for my own portfolio, particularly under these circumstances. But I’ll be very interested to watch and see how this plays out.
I’d rather buy the growth shares revealed for free in the report below.

Australian equity market turned jittery with US bond yields sliding down leading to inverted yield curve and simmering US China trade tension. S&P/ASX 200 witnessed worst single day dip in last 18 months, with $60 billion being wiped off. The reporting season has also signalled mixed performance of ASX listed companies. The benchmark index ended the week lower on 16 August at 6405.5, down 2.6 points.
Let us look at the key updates of 5 popular ASX stocks:
iSignthis Ltd (ASX: ISX)
iSignthis Ltd is engaged in enabling its financial sector and AML regulated clients better comply with the ever-increasing regulatory requirements for payments and identity verification, banking on its payment processing and transactional banking capability as well as emoney deposit taking. Via its Paydentity™ and ISXPay® solutions, the company offers end-to-end on-boarding service for merchants.
iSignthis is among one of the most discussed stocks for its humongous return on stock exchange. The stock has returned as big as 417.95% return in the past six months.
The company recently inked a licencing agreement for Australian Principal Membership with the Asia-Pacific-Singapore based regional subsidiary of Visa Inc (NYSE: V). The company generates revenue on the basis of percentage fees charged to its contracted merchants as the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on the amount of sale processed by ISX on behalf of the merchant.
This extension of principal member relationship with Visa has strengthened the company profile of iSignthis, which already is a Principal Member of ChinaUnionPay, Mastercard, Diners and Discover in Australia, with similar level of memberships in the European Economic Area (EEA).
In 2017, the overall value of the card processing market in Australia was worth $748 billion across all card schemes, with the majority of the value being driven by retail point of sale as card present transactions.
ISX stock price last traded at A$0.96, down 4.95 percent, on 16 August 2019. As at 30 June 2019, cash reserves of the company stood at $9,989,000.

Source: STX’s market update
On 14 August 2019, Strike Energy Limited shared an update on the Wagina sandstone conventional gas discovery at West Erregulla-2.
The update follows the further interpretation of the wireline logs at Wagina that was conducted by the company, incorporating proven regional cut-offs in the petrophysical analysis as used in the case of Beharra Springs’ fields. This further interpretation resulted in an upgrade of net reservoir to minimum 10.2 metres in the Wagina sandstone.

Australian Securities Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange cross listed iSignthis Ltd (ASX : ISX | FRA : TA8) (the Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into terms to acquire 100% of the issued capital of an EU based core banking platform software business (“the Business”).
The Business has been in operation for more than a decade, and services more than fifteen (15) prudentially regulated entities across the EU, Asia and North America, with regards to their core banking platform requirements. The Company is expected to deliver a modest, but positive, EBIT contribution for FY2018 (Dec)

The Business’ core banking services have recently been certified, and the Company intends to augment the offerings by the Business by adding its card processing modules as they also become progressively certified, including Visa, Mastercard, JCB and others. This will expand the Business’ product range and revenue opportunities. The Business’ revenue model is at present based upon a software licensing model, with annual maintenance fees, based upon licensed software installed on local servers operated by the banking client. The Company expects that the Business’ revenue model can be readily adapted to a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, which can in future be hosted as part of the Company’s secure and certified cloud infrastructure. SaaS services can command higher fees, as they are ready to use, without the need for case by case certifications and client side infrastructure deployments.

In addition to the future SaaS licensing opportunities around core banking and card processing SaaS, the Business is a strategic acquisition for the Company as it provides proven and certified systems as follows; • Core Banking Platform • E-banking (Client Portal) • Mobile Banking Application • Loans & Mortgages Module • Portfolio Management • IBAN Validation API • Integration between ATM and POS switches, and the Core Banking System. • Wire Payments - SWIFT, SEPA and Earthport Integration

The Company’s EMA services will be integrated to the above certified services as soon as readily possible, allowing our business customers and merchants access to the rich features of the core banking platform. The Business shall operate as an independent business unit, sharing legal, treasury, and HR functions with the parent and sister companies. The Client portal will allow retail customers to view their ISX IBAN accounts.

The Company expects to reach definitive agreement within 10-14 days, and complete due diligence within that period. Subject to due diligence, the Company will acquire the business within a further 7 days for €300,000 cash at completion, and €100,000 in ISX ordinary shares in six months, with an earn out commission paid in cash for sales completed within the next three (3) months, based on receipted cash.

John Karantzis, CEO of iSignthis said “The addition of a proven core banking platform will allow ISXPay to accelerate its eMoney Account (EMA) portfolio rapidly, and to provide enhanced services to its business and prospective retail customers. The already certified integration to SWIFT and SEPA will save significant time for the Company, and will allow ISXPay to integrate quickly into our Central Banking facilities. The certified Tier 1 card scheme software developed by iSignthis inhouse will also be available as a licensed or SaaS service from the Business, complementing the core banking offering and strengthening the value proposition to small banks and PSPs.”

Drowning or Waving? How to Stay Afloat in a Tsunami of Compliance Technology
RegTech and SupTech (RegTech for supervisory agencies) are now seen as opportunities creating massive shake-ups in our financial institutions’ deep-rooted legacy banking IT systems and supervisory procedures. Traditional management of compliance, risk ID, regulatory reporting and transaction monitoring will certainly be revamped in the aftermath of the Royal Commission’s findings, to deal with the weaknesses in conduct and risk management, and to increase supervisory effectiveness.
But adopting new technology without having a strategic and overarching long-term view of where financial supervision should head is futile, which is why InnovationAus.com feels NOW is the moment to gather federal government policy makers, the financial institutions, the technology providers and the regulators, all under one roof to examine the national strategy for financial regulation and the way forward for each stakeholder.
The event will gather Chief and Heads of Compliance, Chief Risk Officers and CTOs from the Financial Services sector; Heads of Change & Transformation; Innovation; Audit; and Wealth Management, CEOs, MDs and founders from Fintechs and Regtechs; and senior executives from ASIC and APRA


WHY ATTEND?

Join 120+ government, academic and industry leaders who will be discussing the strategic role Regtech and Suptech will play in the regulated financial sector moving forward, including:
Will Australian RegTech partnerships be crucial for banks moving forward, in light of the Banking Royal Commission?
Will we see a rise in SupTech and can it tackle the challenges faced by ASIC and APRA?
Do we need Government policy and investment to grow the sector, to ensure banks enhance their regulatory practices?
The universe of RegTech is growing with new, innovative participants – it’s an exciting market – but how can the banks stay afloat amidst the tsunami of emerging regulatory tools?
What RegTech tools actually make it easier for firms to interact with regulators, at a lower cost and administrative burden?
The role of policy – incumbent institutions are reticent to work with third party fintechs - what role would be most useful for policy to play in order to foster development and adoption of RegTech in financial services?

Ixaris to Remotely Verify UBO via iSignthis.com
Melbourne, Nov 2, 2016 AEST (ABN Newswire) - iSignthis Ltd ( ASX:ISX ) is pleased to announce the commencement of their 'key controller' digital KYC service, with global payments expert, Ixaris. iSignthis has adapted its consumer facing Digital KYC service to verify the natural persons who are the merchant's key controllers, including Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs), directors, officers and other stakeholders.Highlights:- Ixaris using iSignthis digital KYC service to verify corporate 'key controllers'- The service is now live and transactingThe key controller/UBO service for Ixaris is now live and transacting, providing Ixaris a means to verify the key controllers of merchants, including travel agents and other partners, that use, resell or promote the Ixaris payment services.iSignthis CEO, John Karantzis commented, "We are delighted to have launched with Ixaris. Together, we have revolutionized the way merchants can now be on-boarded to payment services, by automating the verification of key controllers. PSP's no longer have to depend on time consuming and expensive manual processes, as iSignthis can now automate and fast track the verification of 3rd party identified key controllers, through our Digital KYC service. This is a massive step forward in automating the back office for the payments industry."Industry OverviewiSignthis' Paydentity(R) solution offers Payment Service Providers (PSP's) a fast and efficient way to verify key controllers of merchants with legal structures including corporates, trusts, clubs and associations, leading to significantly faster and simplified on-boarding of the merchant.PSP's are obligated under AML regulation to identify and verify not only the corporate structure of merchant entities to whom they intend to provide services, but also identify and verify the natural persons who are key controllers associated with that merchant. Key controllers are usually identified as part of a conventional database search on the merchant, either through a data broker, or direct with the registrar of companies in each jurisdiction. The past difficulty has then been in verifying the natural persons who have been identified under a database search as being key controllers.Typically, PSP's, including credit/debit card acquirers, card issuers and eWallets, have manually conducted KYC verification of key controllers via notarized or certified documents, or face to face interviews. This process can typically take between 15 to 28 working days, or sometimes much longer, potentially causing huge delays in the remote verification of key controllers, and thus leading to delays in the on-boarding of the merchant to the PSP service.About IxarisIxaris is the business payments expert and is single-mindedly focused on delivering perfect fit payments capabilities to businesses that transform and optimize their payments processes and avoid the compromises of cost, control and convenience that off-the-shelf and bespoke technologies bring.

Story 43
Katana Asset Management fund manager Romano Sala Tenna said the heat came out of the gold sector on Monday after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell soothed the market at the weekend.
Speaking in Switzerland, Mr Powell flagged he did not forsee, or expect, a US recession despite trade war uncertainties.
"Jerome Powell has said they'll do what they need to do to maintain greater momentum, that's counter the gold trade because that's creating market certainty and market stability," Mr Sala Tenna said.
"The gold price has dropped but it's had a good run up for three reasons," Mr Tenna said.
He said that market uncertainty and the trade war have been supportive for the gold price. Second, central banks have bought the most gold since the gold standard was eliminated in the 1970s. Third, large investors are putting their money in gold because bonds are yielding a negative coupon rate.
Also on the downside, healthcare group CSL slipped 1 per cent to $239.55 a share.
Banks were having a better day. National Australia Bank rose 1 per cent at $28.03 and Westpac advanced 0.8 per cent at $28.85. Commonwealth Bank shares were up 0.3 per cent at $79.81 and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group climbed 0.5 per cent to $27.20.

Away from the banks, building materials group James Hardie climbed 1.8 per cent at $23.43 while real estate listings group REA Group advanced 2.4 per cent to $107.70. Electronics goods retailer JB Hi-Fi hit a 12-month high of $33.60 during the session.
The positive mood around the banks and consumer-sensitive stocks came as new lending data showed that total lending rose 1.3 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis in July, as lending to businesses fell 1.1 per cent but lending to households rose 3.9 per cent.
Household lending was strong in July, jumping 5.1 per cent in July. The numbers potentially provided investors with optimism that post-election efforts to prop up consumption could be working.
The data "is a positive for consumers given housing is their biggest asset,” said NAB economist Kaixin Owyong.
Other companies to trade at a 52-week high on Monday included Ausdrill, Western Areas, Spark New Zealand, Coles, Afterpay Touch and Xero.
In an unexpected market update, neo-bank iSignthis posted an annualised gross processed turnover volume (GPTV) exceeding $1.1 billion in August, up 160 per cent from June 30, prompting the share price to jump 15 per cent to $1.56 a share.
The dual-listed company, which delivers remote identity verification and payment authentication coupled with e-money and transactional banking, told the market on Monday its business customer approvals were up 28 per cent to 270.

Citigroup upgraded property developer Mirvac to "buy" from "neutral" saying that risks in 2020 are skewed to the upside. Shares were up 0.7 per cent at $3.09 a share.
The broker, which lifted its price target to $3.50 a share from $3.41 a share, said completed developments were incrementally increasing office net operating income and noted new tailwinds for the housing market.
Suncorp shares edged up 0.2 per cent $13.77. It appointed 14-year veteran Steve Johnston as its chief executive officer and delivered him a remuneration package that could see him earn as much as $5.4 million a year.

One of the great things about the Easter break is that it gives everyone a chance to take an enforced break from day to day share market trading and think about the broader macro trends.
And from my perspective the two trends worth keeping an eagle eye on are the Australian dollar and the continuation or otherwise of trade tantrums on world share markets.
Dollar shows first signs of weakness
We got a good preview of the first trend in the past week as the Australian dollar started to show some perhaps overdue recognition that the yield advantage we have traditionally enjoyed over many countries is evaporating and reversing.
With no sign of official interest rates rising here in the foreseeable future and a progressive series of rises planned in the US and most likely many other countries as well, the dollar bulls are going to need to look much harder for a reason for the Australian dollar to stay strong relative to offshore currencies.
Relatively firm prices for iron ore and other commodities such as coal which we export by the shipload is certainly one but what happens if the price of ‘Aussie’ commodities begins to slide?
Certainly the carry trade – which sees offshore investors send money here to enjoy higher interest rates – will be evaporating from all but the lowest interest rate countries such as Japan.
Economic growth premium also disappearing
It is also unlikely that Australia will record an economic growth premium over as many countries as it traditionally does either, with the US last week recording a stellar 2.9 per cent GDP growth in the fourth quarter, once again surpassing expectations of around 2.7 per cent.
Certainly the past week has seen the first real signs of Australian dollar weakness as it continued to slowly decline against US dollar, reaching into the US76.6c region before rallying slightly, the lowest level for 2018.
There are still some Australian dollar bulls around but they are getting lonely and it is worth considering some diversification strategies to cope with a falling dollar.
Perhaps the most common is to buy Australian companies with much of their earnings offshore, particularly in US dollars, to hedge against the chances of a weaker dollar.
Then there is the option to buy offshore shares or indices directly, most commonly through locally listed exchange traded funds (ETF’s).
Then there is the option of investing directly in different currencies through vanilla and geared exchange traded funds such as USD, YANK, POU and EEU.
It is obviously an individual decision but with many Australian investors heavily overweight local equities and cash, a potentially weakening dollar provides some impetus to consider the best method of getting some offshore diversification.
On the second front, world share markets are beginning to trade in a way that is reminiscent of the taper tantrums that happened when the US Fed first began reeling in its extraordinary loose monetary policy following the global financial crisis.
Then the markets went through repeated dummy spits despite nothing really changing too much on the company earnings side and this time the trade tantrums look fairly similar.
That is not to say that a “risk-off” strategy is not a good idea in the face of US President Trump’s continuing threats of trade wars against China and others, although it is worth noting that the original steel and aluminium tariffs are looking less scary by the day as various countries such as Canada, Mexico and Australia are awarded exemptions and concessions.
The jury is still out as to whether the threats are more of a bargaining chip rather than reality but investors are likely to remain skittish as long as they feel like they can’t get their arms around the trade issue.
While that is happening, even the attraction of the good fundamentals of synchronised global growth and persistent low inflation will remain in the background, only emerging again when the trade issue is resolved.
One interesting thing to watch is whether the US S&P 500 will drop back to the February 8 correction low of 2580 points.
It has got close a couple of times but is still hanging above that level even during the worst of the trade tantrums.
Property market going sideways rather than plummeting
Another thing to watch out for this coming week is the latest March CoreLogic property price levels, which will be released on Tuesday.
So far the softening in property prices in Australia this year is following the traditional pattern of trading broadly sidewards following a period of very strong growth.
So far annual price growth across Australia’s mainland state capitals has slowed to 0.7 per cent, helped along largely by recent declines in Sydney and Melbourne.
According to CoreLogic, prices across Australia’s five mainland state capitals have slipped 0.1 per cent in average weighted terms.
That reflected a 0.2 per cent drop in Melbourne which, along with a 0.1 per cent decline in Brisbane, offset flat to slightly higher results in the other capitals.
The small losses in Melbourne coincided with a record number of auctions.
Prices in Sydney, which previously led the recent national slowdown, have been flat while those in Adelaide and Perth rose by 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.
Combined with prior losses, all mainland state capitals except for Brisbane have seen prices decline this year, led by Sydney’s 1.8 per cent fall.
Small cap stocks this week
The small cap sector was dominated by commodities news, as both copper and cobalt once again made an impact on investor outlooks in Australia.
With that having being said, new-age market developments are coming to the fore rather quickly in the form of competitive gaming and medical marvels that could soon be gracing store shelves across Australia, if not online.
With that in mind, here are the news stories that stood out first and foremost this week.
OZ Minerals (ASX: OZL) and Avanco Resources (ASX: AVB)
Avanco’s 1,800 square kilometre landholding in Brazil’s Carajás province attracted the attentions of OZ Minerals, who launched a A$444 million takeover bid for the Brazil-based copper miner this week.
As with lithium, graphite, nickel and cobalt, the copper price is on an upward trajectory, driven by the emerging electric vehicle market.
It turns out copper is just as inextricably linked to the emergent battery market as lithium, cobalt and graphite — with this fact not escaping the attentions of OZ Minerals who feel comfortable paying a 115% premium to acquire copper-rich Avanco.
During 2017, Avanco produced around 14,000 tonnes of copper and 11,366 ounces of gold from its Antas mine, generating a gross profit of around $17 million.
Avanco has already received endorsement for the takeover with almost a third of its shareholders indicating they would accept the offer in absence of a superior proposal, give boards of both companies already having given the offer a nod of approval.
OZ Minerals claims Avanco’s assets will help it achieve its 50,000tpa of copper and 100,000oz gold low-cost production targets by 2024.
Australian Dairy Farms (ASX: AHF)
Australian Dairy Farms is switching up its business strategy, having announced it would convert all six of its dairy farms to organic and enter the organic infant formula market.
The strategic move is the result of an 18-month plan the company had been developing.
Australian Dairy Farms also said it is introducing operational changes that would “move it up the value chain” and reposition it from being a conventional milk-market company, over to a more value-added organic milk processor.
Australian Dairy Farms acquired a new site last November where it plans to build infrastructure to dry, tin and produce infant formula, with CEO Mr Skene saying the company would work with strategic partners to reduce capital expenditure, with details to be revealed to market in due course.
Adherium (ASX: ADR)
A rather good week for Australian biotechs as several firms received key FDA approvals for completely different reasons.
Adherium was granted 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter (OTC) sales of its Smartinhaler sensor for AstraZeneca’s Symbicort aerosol asthma inhaler — a device that helps patients to maintain medication schedules easily missed under chronic, and often debilitating conditions.
This was in addition to Kazia Therapeutics (ASX: KZA) which received an orphan drug designation for its latest drug candidate tackling brain tumours.
Obtaining the green light for OTC sales of its Smartinhaler SmartTouch for Symbicort means Adherium can now sell its products directly to US consumers nationwide, including through pharmacies and online vendors with no restrictions and without prescriptions.
As validation of the news’ commercial significance, investors bought up Adherium shares and taking its valuation ~45% higher during the course of a single day this week.
Esports Mogul (ASX: ESH)
Many naysayers were doubting it, but the reality is that eSports is a viable niche market that’s currently worth millions of dollars (and gradually maturing into a billion-dollar market).
As one of the first Australian companies to move into this niche market, Esports Mogul’s popularity is growing, with the company reporting a doubling of its registered user base in less than a month.
According to Esports Mogul, its Mogul Arena platform acquired 39,697 registered users in just 6 days. The reason for the sharp increase were two new features launched by Esports Mogul.
Its first innovation of the week was Esports Elite, allowing users to speculate on the outcome of events using its 2nd new feature, zSilver, a virtual loyalty credit system that serves as a means of exchange and voting collateral for participants.
zSilver has been introduced in partnership with Razer, a US-based lifestyle brand for gamers, as a means of monetising the growing interest in eSports from both professional full-time gamers and spectators watching gamers compete.
iSignthis (ASX: ISX)
iSignthis bagged American Express into its growing payments repertoire this week, with wholly-owned subsidiary iSignthis eMoney (AU), signing a payment aggregator agreement with the US giant, currently the world’s largest card issuer by purchase volume.
Introducing AMEX into its existing pool is highly complementary for iSignthis and adds a further layer of functionality for consumers to take advantage of when using ISXPay, the proprietary platform developed and implemented by iSignthis.
As it stands, ISXPay provides a full range of gateway, risk management, risk avoidance and processing services for card transactions, as well as alternative payment methods. With the addition of AMEX, iSignthis bolsters its coverage and is therefore able to offer its services to a greater number of customers.
Magnis Resources (ASX: MNS)
Investors may want to get used to resources companies expanding their horizons into developing end-user technology, as this tendency continues occurring on a weekly basis.
Vertical supply-chain integration offers lower costs and expansive market potential, which is possibly why graphite powerhouse Magnis Resources decided to pull the trigger in acquiring a 10% stake in Charge CCCV (C4V), a US-based, lithium-ion battery technology group, this week.
The deal also includes an exclusive 5-year agreement over selective patents, thereby laying the foundations for resources company Magnis to begin making commercial headway in the lithium-ion battery sector.
The real kicker is that Magnis has acquired a stake in a battery-maker that’s adamant it can avoid the use of cobalt to create high-end batteries.
With cobalt prices currently at around US$95,000 per tonne (and growing), removing cobalt from the lithium-ion battery construction equation could be extremely cost-effective and lucrative for anyone to achieve such as feat. Magnis and C4V will certainly be having a go.
Argosy Minerals (ASX: AGY)
The market is on the cusp of welcoming yet another high-grade lithium carbonate producer in the form of Argosy Minerals.
This week, the small cap lithium developer reported that it is almost ready to begin processing its lithium brine concentrate through its pilot plant with preparations for kicking-off processing at the company’s flagship Rincon project in Argentina, “almost finalised”.
Argosy expects to produce its first lithium carbonate equivalent from its Rincon lithium brine and quickly move towards building a sustainable battery grade lithium production company in the coming years.
Tawana Resources (ASX: TAW)
Tawana Resources is going from strength to strength. Earlier this month, Tawana reported it had begun producing lithium concentrate at Bald Hill in Western Australia.
And this week, Tawana announced that maiden spodumene production at its flagship Bald Hill project had begun, in league with joint venture partner Singapore-listed Alliance Mineral Assets.
The company said that nameplate capacity of 162 tonnes per hour was achieved within the first two weeks of commissioning, with ramp up to full production on-track for the next quarter.
The duo has agreed to a $12.5 million five-year offtake arrangement in place with Burwill Holdings. Burwill will purchase 6% lithium concentrate for five years at US$880 per tonne for 2018 and 2019, with the new price to be agreed on thereafter.
The week ahead
Despite the extended trading break over Easter, there is no shortage of economic data to be released in Australia over the coming week with Tuesday’s Reserve Bank Board meeting looming large, despite no prospect of more than a subtle change of language and no chance of a change in interest rates.
Other releases include manufacturing sector surveys, ANZ job advertisements index, retail trade, building approvals, services sector surveys, international trade and new vehicle sales.
US employment and trade reports round out a relatively busy week of economic releases.

Story 45
It can expect central banks and securities regulators to swarm around it like packs of bees over the coming year, looking to sting any part of its ambitious plan that appears out of line with rising community expectations about governance in financial services.
Facebook's digital wallet, Calibra, and the creation of a consortium to govern a new global cryptocurrency, Libra, and create a new payments system, is only part of the company's financial services aspirations.
David Marcus, the former president of PayPal whom Facebook appointed to lead its blockchain project, told The Australian Financial Review it wanted to use the data generated by Calibra to move into lending. Taking on major banks' profit pools won't be a strategy that endears it to incumbents.
Central banks, regulators to be convinced
So as it is still restoring its reputation among politicians and competition regulators, Facebook is embarking on the monumental challenge of convincing global central banks and financial regulators it should be trusted to hold not only customers' social data, but their financial data too. That's going to involve answering questions about its governance, technical and security capability that could be even more intense than what it faced last year.
While this task, at first blush, seems insurmountable, it may not be. Global regulators are entering a period of deep introspection about their role to support innovation in the new digital economy.
Many regulators are trying to fit round pegs into square holes. Payments, for one, don't fit neatly inside existing banking regulation, especially in the United States. New regimes have been created to encourage start-up digital banks to win licences to improve the banking experience for customers.

Just two weeks ago, the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinates global financial regulation, issued a report on decentralised financial technologies, including blockchain, suggesting a move towards "an activity-based approach to regulation".
This has been seen as a recognition of the reality that financial services are set to be provided by a range of players outside traditional regulated entities.
"Regulators may wish to engage in further dialogue with a wider group of stakeholders, including in the technology sector, that have had limited interaction with financial regulators to date," the FSB said.
Weighing risks, benefits
Regulators know they are going to have to make decisions about whether the risks of eMoney outweigh the promised benefits of lower costs, speed and better security and monitoring over the blockchain.
“We will face difficult choices ahead as policymakers. But we will have to make them,” Tobias Adrian, director of the International Monetary Fund's monetary and capital markets department told a national bank conference in Zurich, Switzerland, last month.
So what particular risks will regulators be examining when they sit down with Facebook and its Libra Association partners?
Adrian's speech pointed to at least three. Regulators will be concerned about the value of Libra, especially the potential for a run. They will pore over the security of the customer accounts, and will want to know that fiat funds are being invested in non-risky and liquid assets. And they will want to be assured about inter-operability, to protect competition and market contestability, given the strong network effects in payments.

Reading Facebook's technical white paper, released on Tuesday, it appears the company and its partners have considered these risks. Libra won't be pegged to a single currency such as the US dollar, but a collection of stable currencies, bank deposits and government securities across multiple markets, minimising exposure to fluctuations from a single region. The reserve will be held in custody by reputable custodians.
The blockchain ledger will be transparent and auditable, to protect against fraud. Facebook and its partners are proposing an open architecture to ensure its Calibra wallet can talk to competitor wallets offered by other players, so there's competition on top of the infrastructure.
Of course, these and many other thorny issues still need to be worked out. Regulators will want assurances around cybersecurity; the system will require constant and heavy investment in security. (Facebook is planning to attach a small cost to payments to prevent denial-of-service attacks.)
There will be questions around latency. The technical white paper says the network should be able to meet 1000 transactions per second, and suggests this can be scaled higher using the computer engineering concept of "parallelism".
Don't forget privacy
There is also a plethora of questions around privacy – a topic Facebook is well rehearsed at answering, although it remains to be seen whether it can be convincing. Privacy on the Libra blockchain transactions will be "pseudonymous", which makes it easier to track hackers who attempt to abuse the system but could show sender and receiver's public addresses, transaction amounts and time-stamps. However, Calibra will not publish individual transactions on chain.
Facebook recognises that its announcement on Tuesday is really the beginning of the regulatory process. And so let the lobbying begin. In the lead-up to Tuesday's announcement, the Financial Times reported that Ed Bowles, Standard Chartered’s European head of corporate and public affairs, will join Facebook in September as its London-based director of public policy.

Facebook's head of Calibra, David Marcus, is confident financial regulators and central banks "are aligned to the mission that we have... All want better competition, lower cost payments, and broader accessibility of financial services for their constituents – and that hasn’t happened. They key is how do we operationalise this, and go to market so it operates within the bounds of current regulation?”
It will be fascinating to see whether regulators heed the call, given Facebook's still recent transgressions.
