There's also GPU Switch technology, which lets gamers toggle between G-SYNC mode for smoother gaming, and Optimus mode for better battery life.\n\nThen there's the Zephyrus M15, a more entry-level device that offers a range of configurations, so it'll appeal to a wide audience. Display options including 240 Hz and 144 Hz FHD panels and a 4K UHD panel let users pick the screen that best fits their needs, while GPU options range from the more affordable yet capable GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, up to the RTX 2070 GPU. There's also enough more than enough connectivity options, including Thunderbolt 3, dual display outputs and USB ports for a mouse, gamepad and external storage.\n\nOther new releases from ASUS include the Zephyrus Duo 15 -- a powerful all-rounder with a secondary touchscreen -- which we review in detail here, and the Strix SCAR 15 and 17, which have been designed with tournament-grade eSports players in mind. No word yet on pricing or specific launch dates, although ASUS says the refreshed range of laptops and peripherals will be available in Northern America from spring or summer this year."

            "content": "Zephyrus is ROG's flagship gaming laptop series and often acts as a showcase for bleeding-edge tech and design features. The first model in the range was the standard-bearer for NVIDIA's Max-Q design to help get the most of its small thermal profile. Then in 2017, it showed off a machine that measured just 16.9mm thick when closed, but packed a powerful GTX 1080 card inside. The profile was far narrower than its rivals, like the Razer Blade.\n\nThe Zephyrus Duo has an arguably more noticeable feature. Yes, there's a fairly big chin at the bottom of its primary display, but that's not lazy design. The ScreenPad , sorry, ROG ScreenPad Plus, articulates, angling upwards and making it much easier for you to see both displays at once. The 14.09-inch ScreenPad Plus packs a UHD (3,840 x 1,110) AH-VA 60Hz touchscreen, with a non-glare coating and stylus support. And it should make it easier to stream a game and keep an eye on your stats without it cluttering up the main screen.\n\nSquint and you'll notice that the displays look a little bit like Intel's dual-screen concept laptop, the Honeycomb Glacier. That, too, had a rising secondary display, although in that case, both screens were joined together with a hinge for more customization. We suspect that the current implementation is a smart compromise, not to mention a way of getting more air to the Duo 15's overpowered internals.\n\nIt's not lacking in capital-P power, either, with a 10th-generation Intel Core i9-10980 HK (an 8-core, 16-thread chip) paired with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 2080 Super. The Super is a small tweak on the existing 2080, with 128 more CUDA cores, two additional Ray Tracing cores, a pair of extra Texture Cores and 8GB DDR6 RAM clocked at 15.4Gbps rather than the 14Gbps of its predecessor. You'll have the option of up to 32GB RAM, and you can spec it with up to 2TB SSD with Raid 0 support.\n\nTo prevent the Duo from heating up and doubling as a pizza stone, ASUS has had to work hard to get the cooling right, with a new AAS Plus (Active Aerodynamic System.. Plus) system that promises 30 percent more airflow into the laptop. The company is also using Thermal Grizzly's Conductonaut compound between the CPU, GPU and their respective heat sinks. Conductonaut is beloved by PC nerds: a \"liquid metal\" that's more conductive than regular thermal paste to better dissipate heat. In a laptop, it's going to hopefully result in a slightly cooler and quieter machine.\n\nWith the focus on the second screen, it's easy to forget about the 15-inch primary display which has some tricks of its own. Buyers will get the choice of either a 300Hz/3ms FHD (non-touch) display, or a 4K Adobe RGB non-touch model, with both choices being Pantone-validated as a matter of course.\n\nConnectivity-wise, you'll get 1 USB-C 3.2 port, with support for Thunderbolt 3, two more regular USB 3.2 ports, a HDMI-out and two 3.5mm ports, as well as a full-sized ethernet port.\n\nASUS ROG has also said that the Zephyrus Duo 15 will lead a new range of Zephyrus gaming laptops, each re-designed to house new 10th generation Intel CPUs. That includes the Strix SCAR 17, with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 2080 Super, a 17.3-inch, 300Hz FHD display and the option of an Intel Core i9-10980HK CPU, up to 32GB RAM and three SSD slots that can be configured in Raid 0.\n\nSimilarly, a new Strix G15, which now comes in Electro Pink, packs a 10th-generation Core i7, RTX 2070 Super and a 240Hz FHD display. And the aforementioned Thermal Grizzly's Liquid Metal will be used in every one of these new models to bolster heat dissipation and improve thermal performance across the range.\n\nThe ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 will be available in June, with the base model priced at £2,999.99, roughly $3,530 -- and we'll update this when we have official US pricing."

The design not only lends strength and durability to the cable (at the cost of it being a little on the chunky side) it also allows the cable to almost wrap itself into a neat and tidy coil that will stay wound without the need for velcro straps or other restraints.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe magnets facilitate several different cable organization approaches, not just coils. Photo : Kickstarter\n\nThe magnets are strong, but not so strong that the cable can’t be easily unwrapped with a gentle tug, so the added functionality doesn’t impede the overall usability of the SuperCalla. And as with any device featuring magnets, the upgrade turns what is essentially a boring wire into another fidget-friendly desktop toy, and the perfect distraction for the endless video conference calls we all have to sit through now.\n\n\n\nUse a Capture Card to Stealthily Play Animal Cross... Read on The Inventory\n\nThe SuperCalla’s creators have launched the product through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign with the intent of raising $10,000 to facilitate the start of manufacturing, but to date, it has managed to raise close to $300,000 with 26 days still to go. As with any crowdfunded product, there’s always risk involved, and while the team behind this one already has a handful of successful Kickstarters and shipped products under their belts, the current challenges around the world could lead to both manufacturing and shipping delays. If you’re still interested, a pledge of $19 lets you pre-order one of the cables, with whatever connector you need, and delivery expected sometime in June if all goes according to plan."

            "content": "I carry a lot of tech; pretty much anytime I leave the house I'll have a backpack with at least a laptop and two phones, and I'm constantly traveling (of course, current events notwithstanding). That means I'm always on the lookout for the best batteries to keep all of the tech charged up without having to hunt for wall outlets. Even when I'm working around the house, where I want to sit and work isn't always right next to a power outlet, so I'll grab a big battery to sit right next to me where there's no chance a cord could get tripped on or tangled. There's been a steady improvement in really big portable batteries with high outputs for us with laptops as they shift to USB-C, and the latest one I'm using is the Aukey 26000mAh portable battery. Here's why it now has a home in my backpack as my only on-the-go power bank.\n\nBig power Aukey USB-C 26000mAh power bank Bottom line: This is an exceptional large battery for anyone who needs to regularly charge up a laptop on the go. It also has three-port charging for multiple devices at once, both over USB-C and USB-A. It offers great value for the money considering all of its capabilities. The Good USB-C 65W output for laptops\n\nUSB-A with Quick Charge 3.0\n\nThree-device simultaneous charging\n\nGreat value for money The Bad Casing feels cheap\n\nUSB-C port labeling is poor\n\nOverkill for just phones and tablets $80 at Amazon\n\nPrior to this battery I was using the Mophie Powerstation 3XL with 45W of USB-C output, which was good enough to get the job done with my laptop but couldn't hang with keeping my laptop charging while powering up any other devices. It also only had a single USB-C port for output, which was of course limiting. This new Aukey battery solves both problems, and at a much lower price: just $80. This power output is incredible, with great versatility in charging multiple devices. Here are the basics on this battery. It offers a 26800mAh (99.16 Wh) capacity. It has two USB-C ports, with one outputting a maximum of 65W and the other topping out at 18W. There's also a USB-A port, which uses Quick Charge 3.0 up to 18W, and Aukey specifically calls out that it has \"a special mode to charge low-current devices like wireless headphones and fitness trackers.\" At 6.5 x 3.4 x 1.2 inches (165.1 x 86.4 x 30.5 mm) and 1.54 lb (699 g), it's right in line with the crowd of batteries at this capacity. This battery, for me, is all about the power output. 65W over USB-C is more than the 61W my 13-inch MacBook Pro's wall charger offers, meaning this will charge up most mainstream laptops at the same rate as their wall charger — and power up larger (or gaming-focused) models at a decent rate. The 26800mAh capacity will get my MacBook from dead to full, even while I'm using it normally, which has the effect of removing a lot of my battery life anxiety when using my laptop out of the house. Even with a phone charging, you still have enough power to keep your laptop going. The battery has a total output of 65W, which means if you utilize the other ports you won't ge tthe full grunt from the main port. But that actually just makes that max output number even more important — when you're charging a phone or tablet on the 18W USB-C port, that still leaves behind 47W for the main USB-C port for a computer, which is enough to keep you going. It also means you could easily charge three phones, or a tablet and two phones, at their maximum rate simultaneously. The battery recharges at 45W over that main USB-C port, and in my testing I got it from dead to full in just over two and a half hours. That's only a little longer than you'd expect to charge up a laptop nowadays, and right in line with other batteries of this size I've tested. It's easy to get this thing charged up with one of Aukey's new GaN USB-C PD wall chargers, too.\n\nThe flaws are very minor here — this battery gets the job done. If there's one thing you give up here it's hardware quality, which is about as basic as it gets. I appreciate my Mophie battery's little touches like a durable fabric exterior and easy-to-read status LEDs on the edge of the case. This Aukey battery is just the typical combination of hard matte plastic around the bulk of the case with shiny plastic on both ends — which isn't my favorite, because the glossy plastic area is simply going to get destroyed with scratches during use. The power button (found on the end with the ports) is easy to press with a satisfying click, and it's easy to see the battery level with four LEDs next to it. But the markings for the two USB-C ports are just raised slightly in the same glossy black plastic plate, so it can be hard to differentiate between the two. I'm likely to never remember which is which, but you need to because it's important to know since the \"primary\" port is the only one with 65W output and the only one that'll recharge the battery. A big \"1\" and \"2\" or \"65W\" and \"18W\" mark would be so much better.\n\nDespite the couple of tiny design choices that I'd personally tweak, this is incredible value for money in a big, high-output battery. Getting 26800mAh of capacity, concurrent three-device charging with both USB-C and USB-A, and the ability to charge up a laptop at 65W for only $80 is fantastic. Especially when it comes with a name like Aukey behind it, a company I've trusted for accessories for a long time. This is my new go-to battery that will take up residence in my backpack to ensure I have my laptop, phones and accessories charged up on the go. A battery this big may be overkill for some people who just need to recharge their phone on some days when they use it heavily, but for me a battery like this is an essential part of how I get work done on the go.\n\nAukey USB-C 26000mAh power bank It's tough to find a battery that can charge your laptop up as fast as a wall plug, and do so at a reasonable price. Aukey gets it done, and gives you the versatility to charge up multiple devices as well. $80 at Amazon"

            "content": "Back in 2001, a middle-aged man made a video of his car and sent it around to a few friends. So far, so predictable—but this video featured a dilapidated Vauxhall Nova whizzing around a junk-strewn yard in a cloud of fog. At the wheel was Peter Dearman, a rumpled-looking autodidact who had spent the better part of four decades imagining a way to build engineering's ultimate vaporware: a motor powered only by air.\n\nBorn in 1951 on an egg farm north of London, Dearman would seem an unlikely candidate to have solved the problem. He left school at age 15 and worked in the family business for a while, then took a job at a local sheet-metal factory. He spent his evenings as many Englishmen do—out in the garage or the garden shed, tinkering. But Dearman's aptitude and ambition set him apart from other hobbyists. Over the years he filed patents for an improved adjustable wrench, a solar hot-water system, and a portable resuscitator that is still used in ambulances today. His most impressive achievement, however, was the Nova, whose engine he cobbled together from string, a used beer keg, a red plastic trash bin, and a coffee can's worth of liquid nitrogen.\n\nSee more from The Climate Issue | April 2020. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nThe idea behind Dearman's project dated back to at least 1899, when a Danish inventor named Hans Knudsen claimed to have designed an automobile that could run on “clear, bluish” fuel—liquefied air, to be sold at a penny a gallon. Rather than spewing out a toxic mix of pollutants and greenhouse gases, it would leave a harmless trail of condensation in its wake, wafting by at the stately speed of 12 mph. Knudsen received admiring media coverage at the time, but his company went belly-up in a matter of years. Modern cynics suspect he was engaged in a Theranos-style fraud, in part because no one could figure out how he'd done it. For years, a working liquid-air engine seemed about as fanciful as a perpetual motion machine.\n\nStill, the underlying principle was sound. Most engines rely on heat differentials. In the case of, say, a gasoline-powered car, the fuel is mixed with air, crammed into a piston chamber, and set alight, causing it to jump more than 1,000 degrees in temperature. The gas rapidly expands, propelling the piston and, in turn, the wheels. Take the same process, slide it way down the Fahrenheit scale, and you've got a liquid air engine. The nitrogen fuel starts out at 320 degrees below zero. When it enters the (much warmer) piston chamber, it boils off into gas. The change in temperature is smaller than with gasoline, so the pistons move with a little less oomph—but it's enough to get the wheels going. The real problem comes later: All that frigid fuel coursing through the engine quickly freezes it, effectively wiping out the heat differential. The air stops expanding, and the car runs out of puff.\n\nThe roadblock was clear, Dearman told me recently. He'd been pondering how to get around it since he was a teen. In a car that runs on heat, you need something to keep it cool—a radiator. In a car that runs on cold, you need the opposite. “I had an idea in my head for how to make it work, but I knew I wasn't going to get anywhere until I had some research to go on,” he said.\n\nThe breakthrough came in 1999. Dearman was watching an episode of the BBC's dearly departed flagship science program, Tomorrow's World, in which the presenter visited the University of Washington to report on a rather clunky-looking converted mail truck. It had trouble with hills, and its top speed was 22 mph, but it ran on liquid nitrogen (a profligate 5 gallons per mile). Invented by Abe Hertzberg, an eccentric professor who had previously come up with a laser-powered airplane, the truck boasted one major innovation. Before the freezing-cold fuel reached the engine, it ran through a heat exchanger, a series of concentric tubes that circulated outside air around the fuel line. John Williams, who worked on the truck as a graduate student, explained that the exchanger ensured “the whole thing didn't turn into a giant ball of ice.” But it didn't tackle the fundamental problem—that the liquid nitrogen still rapidly cooled the engine, throttling its own expansion into a gas. “Our project was a proof of concept,” Williams explained. “We were reconciled to a certain degree of terribleness.”\n\nMethane emissions burped out by cows could be cut by 99 percent if farmers changed 2 percent of the ruminants' diet to seaweed.\n\nFrom his sofa in the historic market town of Bishop's Stortford, Dearman immediately saw both the logic of Hertzberg's design and a way of improving on it. The answer to making sure the nitrogen continued expanding? Antifreeze. “It's obvious, but it's only obvious once you've seen it,” Dearman said. He went out into his garage, grabbed a blue plastic jug from the shelf, and started playing around with his lawn mower, hacking its engine to squirt a mixture of antifreeze and water into the piston chambers on each stroke. This brought ambient heat directly to the place it was needed most—and the engine's efficiency skyrocketed. The same trick worked on the battered Nova, bought as a guinea pig."

            "content": "Stefan eefting is, as he puts it, “a long-lasting guy” in the shipping industry. He started as an apprentice engineer in a German shipyard in 1984, and now he's a senior vice president at MAN Energy Solutions, a firm whose engines power every second vessel on the deep seas. Over the course of Eefting's career, he's watched ship engines grow from massive steel contraptions to epically huge ones: The 100,000-horsepower monsters in today's cargo ships are five or six times the size of a house. And for decades, the vast majority of them have ingested heavy fuel oil—the leftover dregs of petroleum distillation, a product so viscous it's practically a solid at room temperature. “Like chewing gum,” Eefting says. “You have to heat it to 140 or 150 degrees Celsius to even load it into the engine.”\n\nHeavy fuel oil burns thick and dirty, throwing off oxides of nitrogen and sulfur and producing more carbon emissions than almost any other fossil fuel. But it's cheaper than anything else on the market. When fuel is your industry's greatest cost—and when your industry guzzles 300 million metric tons of it a year—heavy oil is practically the only choice on the menu.\n\nSee more from The Climate Issue | April 2020. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nThat calculation changed, however, on January 1, when a new international regulation mandating low-sulfur fuel kicked in. Ship owners must now either install devices to scrub sulfur out of their heavy fuel oil exhaust or buy cleaner, more expensive fuel—at $600 or $700 a ton, compared to $400 a ton for heavy fuel oil. And that rule is just a foretaste of a massive transformation that is bearing down on Eefting's industry.\n\nSince the 1990s, ship owners have come under intense pressure to pollute the planet less. Container ships are indispensable to trade, and there's no greener mode of transport to move a freshly riveted pair of jeans from China to the US. But the world's 90,000 or so cargo ships contribute between 2 percent and 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions—more than the share contributed by Canada or Germany.\n\nWhile the sulfur cap is hitting shippers now, the far more daunting and impressive target is 30 years away. By 2050, the United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stipulated, the shipping industry's total emissions must be at least half of what they were in 2008. That goal is even more ambitious than it might sound. Trade will continue to grow even as 2050 approaches, says Johannah Christensen, the managing director of the nonprofit Global Maritime Forum. There will be many more ships at sea, making many more journeys, than there were in 2008. “What that translates to is actually an 85 percent reduction in emissions intensity per ship.”\n\nMeeting the deadline will require the industry to spend as much as $1.4 trillion on new fuel research and production, rejigged supply chains, and a revamped fleet—and no one even knows which solutions will work. The ambition, Christensen says, is “like a moon shot.”\n\nIn some ways, it's easier to decarbonize shipping than, say, automobiles or cement. The number of cargo ships in the world is small enough for them to be individually tracked, and they live so much of their lives in public—being inspected in one international port or another—that they can't slyly break rules the way a cement plant in a corrupt country might. Further, the ships are already regulated by a central authority: the IMO. The nature of this industry—in which ship owners routinely register their vessels under the flags of small countries with lax regulations—also means that the IMO is the rare forum where island nations threatened by rising seas hold significant sway. “Depending on the day you look at it, the Marshall Islands is the second- or third-largest flag register in the world,” says Bryan Comer, a senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation. “And they were instrumental in making the moral argument for reducing emissions at the IMO. If they'd had their way, in fact, they'd have wanted a 100 percent cut, and much before 2050.”\n\nThe WIRED Guide to Climate Change The world is getting warmer, the weather is getting worse. Here's everything you need to know about what humans can do to stop wrecking the planet.\n\nEven so, it's an unusual challenge for an industry to adopt an emissions target while having no clear notion of the technologies that will get it there. Borrowing ideas from other sectors isn't practical. Batteries are out. A container ship crossing the Atlantic would need so many batteries that it would have no room left for containers. Nuclear power, too, is dead in the water—“for political reasons,” says Simon Bennett, the deputy secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping. “The idea of foreign ships coming into your port with a nuclear reactor on board—that just won't be acceptable.”\n\nThe solution most immediately at hand, liquefied natural gas, emits less carbon dioxide than fuel oil, and ship engines can be retrofitted fairly easily to burn it. But carbon emissions from liquefied natural gas are only about 30 percent less than from heavy fuel oil. What's more, the primary component of liquefied natural gas, methane, is highly prone to “slip,” or leak. Atmospheric methane traps 86 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. At best, says Eefting, liquid natural gas is only a temporary answer—an intermediate station on a zero-carbon pathway.\n\nThe fuels with more long-term promise are ammonia and hydrogen, which, when burned, release no carbon emissions at all. MAN plans to deliver its first ammonia engine in 2024. But there's still plenty to be figured out: To be truly green, these fuels will themselves have to be manufactured with no carbon footprint—something the IMO can't regulate. Ammonia production is one of the most carbon-intensive processes in industrial chemistry and is the subject of its own slogging race for sustainable modifications. Meanwhile, ships and ports will have to devise new ways of handling and storing ammonia, given how toxic it is to humans. “Plus, you have to remember,” Eefting says, “ammonia stinks very much.” Hydrogen, for its part, is highly flammable and would require huge, special tanks. “Its molecules are so small that they can leak out of virtually anything,” Eefting adds. “And you need to compress it or cool it to minus-253 degrees Celsius to have a decent energy density.”"

As was announced back in February, this year there are two Moto G phones, the Moto G Power and the Moto G Stylus, and they're up for pre-order today, with a ship date of April 16.\n\nThe two phones look basically identical, with 6.4-inch 2300×1080 LCDs, mostly all-screen designs (with a slightly taller bezel at the bottom), front cameras that live in a circular display cutout, and a vertical strip of cameras on the back. Both phones have the Snapdragon 665 SoC with 4GB of RAM, which is an 11nm, with eight Cortex A73-derivative CPUs running at 2.2Ghz.\n\nThe differences between the two phones are in the storage, battery, cameras, the stylus accessory, and, of course, the price. The cheaper Moto G Power is $250, with 64GB of storage, a 5000mAh battery, and three cameras: a 16MP main sensor, a 2MP macro lens, and a 8MP ultra-wide. The G Stylus loses a lot of battery in exchange for that stylus storage, and it's also 0.5mm thinner than the Power, so the $300 device has only a 4000mAh battery and 128GB of storage. The main camera is 48MP, then there's a 2MP macro lens, a 16MP \"action cam,\" and the addition of laser autofocus.\n\nBoth phones have rear capacitive fingerprint readers (it's in the Motorola logo), MicroSD slots, headphone jacks, and USB-C ports with only 10W rapid charging. A real bummer is that there's no NFC, so no mobile payments.\n\nMotorola doesn't care about updates, and anyone buying the 2020 Moto Gs should know they'll be stuck on the shipping version of the OS (which, thankfully, is Android 10) for a while. The 2019 phones, the Moto G7s, still haven't been upgraded to the six-month-old Android 10. The 2018 Moto G6 launched with Android 8 and got an Android 9 upgrade in July 2019, 11 months after the OS shipped.\n\nThe phones will be sold at all the usual suspects: Best Buy, B&H Photo, Walmart, and Amazon. Verizon will pick up both devices, and Motorola says one or the other should pop up at smaller outlets like US Cellular, Consumer Cellular, Google Fi, Republic Wireless, Xfinity Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, and Ting."
