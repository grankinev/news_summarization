            "content": "A pedestrian in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn on March 28, 2020. Fears are growing that the worldwide economic downturn delivered by the coronavirus pandemic could be especially deep and lengthy, with recovery limited by continued anxiety. (Victor J. Blue/The New York Times) A pedestrian in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn on March 28, 2020. Fears are growing that the worldwide economic downturn delivered by the coronavirus pandemic could be especially deep and lengthy, with recovery limited by continued anxiety. (Victor J. Blue/The New York Times)\n\nWritten by Peter S. Goodman\n\nThe world is almost certainly ensnared in a devastating recession delivered by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNow, fears are growing that the downturn could be far more punishing and long lasting than initially feared — potentially enduring into next year, and even beyond — as governments intensify restrictions on business to halt the spread of the pandemic, and as fear of the virus reconfigures the very concept of public space, impeding consumer-led economic growth.\n\nThe pandemic is above all a public health emergency. So long as human interaction remains dangerous, business cannot responsibly return to normal. And what was normal before may not be anymore. People may be less inclined to jam into crowded restaurants and concert halls even after the virus is contained.\n\nThe abrupt halt of commercial activity threatens to impose economic pain so profound and enduring in every region of the world at once that recovery could take years. The losses to companies, many already saturated with debt, risk triggering a financial crisis of cataclysmic proportions.\n\nStock markets have reflected the economic alarm. The S&P 500 in the United States fell more than 4% Wednesday as investors braced for worse conditions ahead. That followed a brutal March, during which a whipsawing S&P 500 fell 12.5%, in its worst month since October 2008.\n\n“I feel like the 2008 financial crisis was just a dry run for this,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of a history of financial crises, “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.”\n\n“This is already shaping up as the deepest dive on record for the global economy for over 100 years,” he said. “Everything depends on how long it lasts, but if this goes on for a long time, it’s certainly going to be the mother of all financial crises.”\n\nThe situation looks uniquely dire in developing countries, which have seen investment rush for the exits this year, sending currencies plummeting, forcing people to pay more for imported food and fuel, and threatening governments with insolvency — all of this while the pandemic itself threatens to overwhelm inadequate medical systems.\n\nAmong investors, a hopeful scenario holds currency: The recession will be painful but short-lived, giving way to a robust recovery this year. The global economy is in a temporary deep freeze, the logic goes. Once the virus is contained, enabling people to return to offices and shopping malls, life will snap back to normal. Jets will fill with families going on merely deferred vacations. Factories will resume, fulfilling saved up orders.\n\nBut even after the virus is tamed — and no one really knows when that will be — the world that emerges is likely to be choked with trouble, challenging the recovery. Mass joblessness exacts societal costs. Widespread bankruptcy could leave industry in a weakened state, depleted of investment and innovation.\n\nHouseholds may remain agitated and risk averse, making them prone to thrift. Some social distancing measures could remain indefinitely. Consumer spending amounts to roughly two-thirds of economic activity worldwide. If anxiety endures and people are reluctant to spend, expansion will be limited — especially as continued vigilance against the coronavirus may be required for years.\n\n“The psychology won’t just bounce back,” said Charles Dumas, chief economist at TS Lombard, an investment research firm in London. “People have had a real shock. The recovery will be slow, and certain behavior patterns are going to change, if not forever at least for a long while.”\n\nRising stock prices in the United States have in recent years propelled spending. Millions of people are now filing claims for unemployment benefits, while wealthier households are absorbing the reality of substantially diminished retirement savings.\n\nAmericans boosted their rates of savings significantly in the years after the Great Depression. Fear and tarnished credit limited reliance on borrowing. That could happen again.\n\n“The loss of income on the labor front is tremendous,” Dumas said. “The loss of value in the wealth effect is also very strong.”\n\nThe sense of alarm is enhanced by the fact that every inhabited part of the globe is now in trouble.\n\nThe United States, the world’s largest economy, is almost certainly in a recession. So is Europe. So probably are significant economies like Canada, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. China, the world’s second-largest economy, is expected to grow by only 2% this year, according to TS Lombard, the research firm.\n\nFor years, a segment of the economic orthodoxy advanced the notion that globalization came with a built-in insurance policy against collective disaster. So long as some part of the world economy was growing, that supposedly moderated the effect of a downturn in any one country.\n\nThe global recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008 beggared that thesis. The current downturn presents an even more extreme event — a worldwide emergency that has left no safe haven.\n\nWhen the pandemic emerged, initially in central China, it was viewed as a substantial threat to that economy. Even as China closed itself off, conventional wisdom held that, at worst, large international companies like Apple and General Motors would suffer lost sales to Chinese consumers, while manufacturers elsewhere would struggle to secure parts made in Chinese factories.\n\nBut then the pandemic spread to Italy and eventually across Europe, threatening factories on the continent. Then came government policies that essentially locked down modern life, business included, while the virus spread to the United States.\n\n“Now, anywhere you look in the global economy we are seeing a hit to domestic demand on top of those supply chain impacts,” said Innes McFee, managing director of macro and investor services at Oxford Economics in London. “It’s incredibly worrying.”\n\nOxford Economics estimates that the global economy will contract marginally this year, before improving by June. But this view is likely to be revised down sharply, McFee said.\n\nTrillions of dollars in credit and loan guarantees dispensed by central banks and governments in the United States and Europe have perhaps cushioned the most developed economies. That may prevent large numbers of businesses from failing, say economists, while ensuring that workers who lose jobs will be able to stay current on their bills.\n\n“I am attached to the notion that this is a temporary crisis,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. “You hit the pause button, and then you hit the start button, and the machine starts running again.”\n\nBut that depends on the rescue packages proving effective — no sure thing. In the typical economic shock, government spends money to try to encourage people to go out and spend. In this crisis, the authorities are demanding that people stay inside to limit the virus.\n\n“The longer this goes on, the more likely it is that there will be destruction of productive capacity,” Owens Thomsen said. “Then, the nature of the crisis morphs from temporary to something a bit more lasting.”\n\nWorldwide, foreign direct investment is on track to decline by 40% this year, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. This threatens “lasting damage to global production networks and supply chains,” said the body’s director of investment and enterprise, James Zhan.\n\n“It will likely take two to three years for most economies to return to their pre-pandemic levels of output,” IHS Markit said in a recent research note.\n\nIn developing countries, the consequences are already severe. Not only is capital fleeing, but a plunge in commodity prices — especially oil — is assailing many countries, among them Mexico, Chile and Nigeria. China’s slowdown is rippling out to countries that supply Chinese factories with components, from Indonesia to South Korea.\n\nBetween now and the end of next year, developing countries are on the hook to repay some $2.7 trillion in debt, according to a report released Monday by the U.N. trade body. In normal times, they could afford to roll most of that debt into new loans. But the abrupt exodus of money has prompted investors to charge higher rates of interest for new loans.\n\nThe U.N. body called for a $2.5 trillion rescue for developing countries — $1 trillion in loans from the International Monetary Fund, another $1 trillion in debt forgiveness from a broad range of creditors and $500 billion for health recovery.\n\n“The great fear we have for developing countries is that the economic shocks have actually hit most of them before the health shocks have really begin to hit,” said Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the division on globalization and development strategies at the U.N. trade body in Geneva.\n\nIn the most optimistic view, the fix is already underway. China has effectively contained the virus and is beginning to get back to work, though gradually. If Chinese factories spring back to life, that will ripple out across the globe, generating demand for computer chips made in Taiwan, copper mined in Zambia and soybeans grown in Argentina.\n\nBut China’s industry is not immune to global reality. Chinese consumers are an increasingly powerful force, yet cannot spur a full recovery. If Americans are still contending with the pandemic, if South Africa cannot borrow on world markets and if Europe is in recession, that will limit the appetite for Chinese wares.\n\n“If Chinese manufacturing comes back, who exactly are they selling to?” asked Rogoff, the economist. “How can global growth not take a long-term hit?”\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "content": "London (CNN Business) The coronavirus pandemic has delivered a shock to tens of millions of people in rich countries around the world: Suddenly, they can't buy the food they want, when they want.\n\nFood supply chains in developed economies are showing increased signs of strain as nationwide lockdowns designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus heap pressure on systems that had very little slack to begin with. The result is empty store shelves, and panicked buyers\n\nThe transportation links that move food around the globe are being tested in unprecedented ways. Shipowners are struggling to change crews and move goods between ports. Airlines have grounded thousands of planes, slashing air freight capacity.\n\nTravel restrictions also are clogging up road networks and making it difficult for farm workers to get where they are needed. And at the end of food supply chains, supermarkets that have come to rely on just-in-time deliveries have been upset by huge demand and panic buying.\n\nGlobal stocks of staple commodities such as wheat, corn and rice are at healthy levels, said Maximo Torero Cullen, chief economist at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. But logistics bottlenecks need to be identified and resolved quickly to ensure goods can get to where they are needed, and protectionist policies avoided, he added.\n\nKazakhstan, a major wheat exporter, temporarily banned shipments of buckwheat, rye flour, sugar, carrots and potatoes earlier in March because the government was worried about domestic supply. While the restrictions have since been eased, similar moves by other countries could be problematic.\n\nThe food supply crunch is getting attention from top policymakers: Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies last week pledged to resolve disruptions to global supply chains and ensure the movement of vital medical supplies, critical agricultural products and other goods and services across borders.\n\nShipping on the front line\n\nA Maersk container ship docks in Fremantle, Australia on March 27, 2020.\n\nShipping would be a good place to start. The vast majority of the world's food supply is carried on ships, either in containers or on board bulk carriers.\n\nYet shipowners, already reeling from shutdowns of some of the world's busiest ports in China, are now having to contend with sweeping lockdowns all over the world, hindering access to ports and making crew changes all but impossible due to travel restrictions.\n\nMaersk AMKAF , the world's largest container shipping company, recently said it had suspended all crew changes for a month partly to minimize the risk of vessels being quarantined by port authorities and causing disruptions to customers' cargo.\n\nBut doing so puts the physical and mental health of seafarers at risk, as they remain on board ships for extended periods without a break, which could lead to crew shortages later on, the International Chamber of Shipping has warned.\n\nMore than 30 ports worldwide are either restricting entry to vessels or prohibiting crew changes, including in Australia, Vietnam, India, Greece, Portugal, Chile and Argentina, according to Wilhelmsen, a maritime industry conglomerate based in Norway.\n\nRules governing port access differ from country to country, and sometimes even within countries, making it very difficult for shipowners to plan routes, said Guy Platten, secretary general at the International Chamber of Shipping. This could snarl food supply chains, particularly for time-sensitive fresh produce, he added.\n\nDelays in transit from ports in China are likely to cause apple juice shortages in the United States, according to a March 13 report by commodities research firm Mintec. Two-thirds of the apple juice Americans drink comes from China.\n\nAir cargo restricted\n\nThe shutdown in commercial aviation caused by coronavirus has sharply reduced air cargo capacity , making it harder and more expensive to move perishable goods that need to be delivered at speed.\n\n\"Passenger operations have been reduced so drastically that there is just not the capacity in the system to meet even the reduced levels of air cargo,\" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nShipments have been delayed as airlines struggle to arrange crews and get permission to fly because of travel restrictions, de Juniac said. \"Last week the European Commission published guidance which will help clear roadblocks in Europe. And we encourage other countries to follow suit,\" he added.\n\nHiten Dodhia, a director of Saturnalia UK, a company that imports high-value fresh produce from Africa and South America and sells it to supermarkets in Europe, said there has been a huge hike in the price of air freight due to the grounding of so many passenger planes.\n\nLockdowns and curfews in countries including Zimbabwe, South Africa, Guatemala and Peru are restricting the movement of workers and causing labor shortages on farms, which will obstruct planting, harvesting and packaging, he told CNN Business.\n\nThe biggest problems lie with vegetables that are planted, harvested and shipped over relatively short time frames, such as mangetout, sugar snaps, baby corn, beans and tenderstem broccoli, Dodhia said. He has told some farmers not to plant because it is unclear whether their goods can be moved to market in time.\n\nLabor and logistics\n\nA seasonal worker tends to raspberries ahead of the fruit picking season at a farm in England.\n\nLabor shortages in Europe and the United States also threaten to seriously disrupt supply chains, push food prices higher and make certain high-value commodities, such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish, hard to find.\n\nBritain's National Farmers' Union has warned that travel restrictions could prevent migrant workers from getting into the country for the upcoming harvest, while a nationwide shutdown will hamper growers' ability to recruit the 80,000 seasonal workers needed this year.\n\n\"We are urging the British people, university students, anyone looking for work, to mobilize behind British growers in this time of national importance and pick for Britain,\" the union's vice president, Tom Bradshaw, said in a statement.\n\nLabor shortages in Europe are meanwhile likely to interrupt Britain's supply of imported fruit and vegetables in the coming months, according to the UK's Landworkers' Alliance, which represents more than 1,000 small British farms and is a member of the international smallholder farmers' movement La Via Campesina. \"Much of our produce comes from Southern Europe, where producers are already delaying and reducing spring plantings due to restrictions on movement of seasonal workers from Eastern Europe, illness, transport restrictions and cashflow,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe price of apples from Poland and broccoli from Spain jumped by roughly 20% between February and March, as consumers hoarded fruit and vegetables, according to Mintec. \"Traffic chaos at the German-Polish border has made transporting apples and other fruits problematic,\" said Mintec.\n\nGovernments must resolve bottlenecks and ensure that perishable goods do not go to waste, said Torrero Cullen. Keeping labor-intensive packaging plants running at full capacity while still following social distancing guidelines will create an additional challenge, he added.\n\nNo slack in the system\n\nTrucks wait to be processed at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\n\nSupermarkets, which are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked amid panic buying, are facing logistics headaches of their own. And just-in-time supply chains mean there is very little slack in the system.\n\nRetailers generally hold between one to three weeks' worth of non-perishable items, such as pasta and rice, in stores and depots, with much lower quantities of fresh produce kept in storage, said Dave Howorth, executive director of Scala, an independent supply chain consultancy to the UK's food and drink sector.\n\n\"Suppliers generally deliver on a daily basis because there's so little stock in the system,\" he added. But if shipments are delayed because of restricted access to ports, or suppliers are held up at border crossings, daily deliveries may not be possible.\n\nPhotos of empty shelves and steps taken by retailers to ration purchases suggest that while there may be plenty of food out there, the systems that get it to where it's needed are being stretched.\n\nThis prompted the UK government to temporarily relax competition laws earlier in March to allow supermarkets to exchange data on stock levels, pool staff to meet demand, and share distribution depots and delivery vans.\n\nAnother factor driving demand at supermarkets: restrictions imposed by governments to reduce the spread of coronavirus mean that people are eating more at home, instead of in restaurants.\n\n\"It's a fundamental change. You've seen a significant switch in volumes, which has been overlaid with panic buying,\" said Howorth. Over the four weeks to March 21, UK shoppers made three additional trips to the grocery store compared to the same period last year, spending an extra £1.9 billion ($2.4 billion), according to Nielsen. An additional 1.2 million online orders were placed over the same period, the research firm said."

            "content": "As Sweatha Varthamanan and Aswin Ravi tied the knot along with over 20 of their closest friends and family in Chennai, nearly as many phones and recording devices were propped in front of their faces. They were live streaming the wedding to the other 200 guests who could not make it, because of the all-India lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“It was surreal. Every girl dreams of her wedding, but this was nothing I had ever imagined. All empty chairs, and 15 smartphones in front of us, like we’re some celebrities,” laughs Sweatha, who married Aswin on March 26, the day after India went under lockdown. They cancelled every other ceremony — mehendi to reception, except for the rites.\n\nAs we battle the novel Coronavirus crisis, couples all over the world have been stripping down their big fat weddings to the bare essentials: a commitment to stay together through thick and thin. No grand decorations, just declarations of love.\n\nA dream destination wedding in Las Vegas was what Autumn Conner had in mind. After all, the Phoenix (Arizona, USA) resident had waited over six months for her now husband Santosh Roychowdhury to fly in from India. “His visa took that long to clear. My side of the family was supposed to fly in from all over the country,” says Autumn, over a VoIP call from her hometown.\n\nBut then on March 14, two days prior to her wedding, Autumn had to call off her plans as the US started to bear the brunt of COVID-19. With social distancing and lockdown protocols kicking in across the country, the couple opted to play it safe, and decided to get married in a private ceremony that was attended by a little over 10 people.\n\nThe just married couple Laila and Boualem Bellil walk in the Stall Courtyard, a most frequented tourist spot, in Dresden, eastern Germany, Thursday, March 26, 2020. They celebrate today without wedding guests because of the government regulations and want to make up for the party next year. In order to slow down the spread of the coronavirus, the German government has considerably restricted public life and asked the citizens to stay at home. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

We just smiled looking at each other,” says Autumn, as she shares pictures of the couple wearing masks and exchanging their wedding kiss. “We wore masks to remind people that it is important to take this pandemic seriously, in the US and around the world,” says Santosh, adding, “but love can overcome anything... even a pandemic.”\n\nSimilar reports have been coming in from Lithuania, Indonesia, Spain, Argentina, Italy and others. In a video that went viral on Twitter, a couple got married on the streets of New York, as their friend who performed the ceremony from a balcony, read out an excerpt from the very apt Love in the Time of Cholera, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.\n\nDifficult choices\n\nBehind the cutesy pictures of masked kisses however, is a rolling stone of shifting plans, guests dropping out, vendors bargaining, and the accompanying stress.\n\n“Forget social distancing, Aswin and I distanced ourselves from each other two days before the wedding,” says Sweatha, adding that their texts would only be “Good Morning”, “Good Night”, and “Did you eat?”\n\n“Both of us were tense and we wanted to avoid arguments about the planning. When the situation is out of our control, it is better to be silent and calm,” she says.\n\nWeddings were one of the exemptions to the lockdown, under certain conditions. According to a Tamil Nadu Government Order, “marriages already fixed on or before March 16, in marriage halls alone can be conducted, subject to a maximum number of 30 guests.”\n\nAnd so, a detailed police permission has to be sought by the marriage hall, and by the couples getting married, citing the guests in attendance.\n\nPranesh Padmanabhan, founder of Studio 31, who covered Sweatha and Aswin’s wedding, explains how his team of photographers were picked up from their homes and dropped at the venue. “Our car was stopped six times for checking permissions,” he says. “After our photographers came back home, they self-quarantined for a week and took temperatures every few hours.”\n\n“Fortunately, the caterer for our wedding agreed to serve to a smaller guest list. Only, instead of cooking at the venue, he brought food from his kitchen to the hall,” says Sweatha. In another wedding that Studio 31 covered in mid-March, the couple had to arrange for food parcels for the 28 guests in attendance, from the nearest Saravana Bhavan after the caterer cancelled.\n\n“The coming three months are known as the wedding season in India. We normally would have about 140 bookings during this period, but 90 % of them dropped out. Now we have about 20, and even they are unsure,” he says. Pranesh has made an effort to document these surreal times through his photographs: Corporation workers hosing down the venue with disinfectants, guests dining a metre apart from each other.\n\nThe silver lining\n\nThe Government has instructed marriage halls to “return the advance paid by the public for all cancelled bookings.” However, some like Pushpa Sridhar claim they are still in the dark about refunds: instead, they are being asked by vendors to set another date.\n\n“It is very disappointing for both families. Airlines have asked our guests to switch the booking to a later date within the next six months. Which means our relatives are asking us if we have set a date yet, but we can’t do that until there is some sense of normalcy!” says Pushpa, mother of the groom.\n\nOn the other hand, Arjun (name changed on request) used the lockdown as the opportunity to have the intimate eco-friendly wedding he and his wife had always pictured. “My wife’s family had wanted a grander wedding, and we debated postponing it. But we went ahead with an intimate affair, because in the end, that is what she and I had wanted.”\n\nArjun proudly recalls how his was one of those few weddings where everybody present was involved in what was happening, rather than having personal conversations. He too had live streamed the ceremony for around 300-400 people, much like Sweatha and Aswin.\n\nThankful for the relaxed affair, Aswin says, “If you think about the ones closest to you, that you want around you, they wouldn’t be more than 30, anyway.”\n\nWith input from Pradeep Kumar"

            "content": "S INCE HE TOOK over as Peru’s president two years ago Martín Vizcarra, an otherwise nondescript politician, has not flinched from taking bold decisions. He pushed political reforms through by referendum. Faced with a serially obstructive Congress, last year he shut it down, calling a fresh legislative election. Characteristically, he was the first Latin American leader to react to covid-19 by imposing a lockdown and curfew, on March 15th when his country had only 71 reported cases. Peruvians appreciate this restriction on their liberties for the public good. In an Ipsos poll his approval rating soared from 52% to 87%.\n\nThat is the pattern in Latin America. In Argentina Alberto Fernández, who took over a politically divided country in December, has seen his popularity rise to over 80% after he imposed a quarantine and sealed borders. In Colombia the new mayor of Bogotá, Claudia López, stole a march over a hesitant national government when she imposed a four-day trial lockdown. Chile’s Sebastián Piñera, whose presidency seemed moribund after protests, has deployed testing and sealed off hotspots. His popularity has crept up, from 10% in December to 21%.\n\nTheir approach contrasts with that of the populist presidents of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, and Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, often called AMLO . Both have given priority to protecting weak economies. Both spent weeks denying the seriousness of the virus and refusing to respect social-distancing measures recommended by their health ministries.\n\nIn Mexico, according to Alberto Díaz-Cayeros, a political scientist at Stanford University, the government’s caution was rooted in trust in the capacity of the health service to deal with the threat. That approach worked against swine flu in 2009. It underestimated covid-19, which spreads aggressively, with many symptomless cases. On March 24th the government pivoted, shutting schools and banning non-essential activity. Six days later, with the virus out of control, it declared a state of emergency.\n\nAMLO has muddled the message about social distancing. Mr Bolsonaro went further, actively sabotaging efforts to control the virus. In Brazil state governors have imposed lockdowns, including in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. These measures are popular. Mr Bolsonaro’s heedlessness is less so. City residents staged pot-banging protests against the president. That prompted a counter-attack. Mr Bolsonaro railed against the governors, issued a video proclaiming “Brazil cannot stop”, and urged supporters to stage cavalcades against quarantines. Only on March 31st, with 201 deaths in Brazil, did he (briefly) recognise the seriousness of the virus, calling for a “pact” against it “to save lives without leaving jobs behind”. He then reverted to his earlier rhetoric.\n\nWhat political consequences will these actions have? Though he is still popular, AMLO ’s approval rating was declining before the virus, because of his failure to halt crime or to revive the economy. That trend seems set to continue. As for Mr Bolsonaro, some think his actions merit impeachment, for threatening the constitutional right to life. His strategy appears aimed at shoring up his base. Polls show he retains the support of a third of respondents. That should be enough to keep his job, depending on how many Brazilians die.\n\nThose who have acted decisively are benefiting from the public’s instinct to rally round their leaders at a time of danger. But sustaining the quarantines in a region where many live precariously will be hard. Take Argentina, where Mr Fernández already faced a stricken economy. His government has made some emergency handouts of money and food in poor areas on the periphery of Buenos Aires, where his Peronist political movement has long run things. Even so, the Peronists “are very worried, they fear a social explosion and losing control”, says Sergio Berensztein, a political consultant. He thinks the government may have to make quarantine more selective and flexible, at the risk of prolonging the epidemic. Much the same goes for Peru.\n\nCovid-19 struck Latin America when its leaders and institutions had fallen into disrepute, because of economic stagnation, corruption and poor public services. Management of the pandemic requires a huge effort to help those in need. It may also offer an opportunity for redemption. Leaders who impose quarantines could save the lives of 2.5m Latin Americans, according to epidemiologists at Imperial College, London. They have to find ways to make citizens remember that, even as economic hardship bites."
