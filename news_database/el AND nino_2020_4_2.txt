Most of the rare climatic events are expounded as an outcome of the El-Nino effect. Do you agree? Given your viewpoint with suitable substantiation.(250 words)\n\nReference: Physical Geography by Savindra Singh\n\nWhy this question:\n\nThe question is around the fact that goes undeniable – that the El Nino has been used to explain unusual climatic changes across the globe.\n\nKey demand of the question:\n\nExplain briefly the concept of El-Nino and its impact on the rare climatic events.\n\nStructure of the answer:\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn short, explain the concept of El-Nino.\n\nBody:\n\nEl Nino means ‘little boy’ or ‘Christ child’ in Spanish. The phenomenon was thus named because it was first recognised by South American fishermen in the early part of the 17th century. The events, i.e., warm waters in the Pacific Ocean, tended to occur in December, hence, the name was chosen.\n\nThen move on to define the likages of El-nino with climatic events.\n\nWhen the linkage between El Nino and climate effects were initially suggested by the British scientist, Gilbert Walker, it was deemed ridiculous that one phenomenon could have an effect on regions as far off as Australia, India etc and Canada. However, the occurrence of El Nino in the past few decades has proved without a doubt, their far-reaching consequences. Some of the effects of El Nino in the past have been causing of droughts and forest fires in South Asia (Indonesia and Philippines) and Australia, floods in the South American countries in the eastern Pacific region, increased rain in certain other areas of the world etc.\n\nConclusion:\n\nConclude with significance of El-Nino."

Meteorologists say that a low probability of El Nino is certainly good news for the monsoon, although the complex weather system depends on many other factors.If the June-September monsoon is normal, farmers struggling with supply disruption during the lockdown can expect a good summer-sown harvest, which would lift India’s economic sentiment and rural demand for goods including two-wheelers, gold, consumer goods, cars and tractors.The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) refers to the warming of the surface waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The IMD said that although the surface waters are currently warm, they are likely to get neutral over the next three months, according to its Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System.The Australian Bureau of Meteorology said in its bi-monthly ENSO update that the waters are neutral, although it added that forecasts about the phenomenon are not very accurate at this time of the year.Warm ENSO conditions lead to drier weather and thus reduced rainfall. This is also why the IMD predicted most parts of India would have a mean temperature that’s 0.5 degree C to 1 degree C above normal.Another phenomenon called the Indian Ocean Dipole is neutral. The phenomenon refers to the difference in temperatures between different parts of the Indian Ocean. The Indian monsoon is helped by a positive IOD rating, which might be the case in the months ahead.Last year, the IOD turned positive towards the end of June, helping the first week of July with a record level of rainfall.“Of the six international climate models surveyed, most indicate neutral IOD for the coming months. One model briefly reaches positive levels at the end of autumn, while several tend towards negative levels during the southern hemisphere winter,” the Australian weather office said."
