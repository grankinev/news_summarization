SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--dLocal, an award-winning fintech company that specializes in cross-border payments for emerging markets, announced today it has expanded its payments network to include Indonesia, Ecuador, and Bolivia.
Leveraging a proprietary and flexible API-based payments-technology platform, dLocal now supports over 300 local payment methods in 15 emerging market countries, including the top five emerging markets in the world by population (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and Mexico).
Following dLocal’s recent expansion:
Merchants that wish to sell in Indonesia will now be able to accept online cash payments, credit card payments from Visa, Mastercard, JCB and American Express, E-Wallet payments from OVO and LinkAja, and bank transfers.
Merchants that wish to sell in Ecuador will now be able to support credit and debit card payments from Visa, Mastercard, and credit card payments from Alia, through a partnership with Kushki, a digital payments platform.
Merchants that wish to in Bolivia can now accept bank transfers in the country.
“Payments infrastructure in LATAM, APAC, and MENA is fragmented and complex,” said Sebastian Kanovich, CEO of dLocal. “Companies that enter these markets without the ability to accept locally-relevant payment methods are often unintentionally limiting their reach and hindering their growth. As part of our mission, we develop deep expertise in each local market we serve, and we’re pleased to add Indonesia, Ecuador, and Bolivia to the growing list of countries available to our clients.”
The addition of Indonesia, Ecuador, and Bolivia expands the total market available to dLocal’s 450 clients to an estimated $140 billion. dLocal serves clients across a variety of primarily online-based business verticals, including e-commerce, SaaS, digital media, travel & tourism, and financial services companies.

As American and European corporations reach a saturation point in their home markets, they begin to look to emerging markets for more growth. When they try to expand their e-commerce operations, they run into challenges with payments — how do they receive payments in a local currency and then convert it to dollars and euros.
As companies gain more experience, they expand the number of emerging markets they want to do business in.
“Four years back when they thought of emerging markets they thought Brazil, and then later Mexico,” said Sebastian Kanovich, CEO of dLocal, which has made a business of taking local payments and delivering dollars or euros. “Now it is also Argentina and Colombia, Egypt and India.”

Some of these markets are becoming more and more important to first world corporations, he added. Brazil is in the top five markets for Uber and Netflix has a huge customer base in Argentina.
The company’s customers are the merchants; the end user, the consumer of Uber rides or Netflix movies, doesn’t see anything of dLocal.
Credit cards are the most widely used payment tool in e-commerce, he said, followed by cash where a user purchases a digital code at a retailers point of sale or from a bank. Wallets are used in some areas and payments by mobile phones are growing in popularity. Banks also offer installment plans which can be paid off in six to 18 months.
“We are that technology infrastructure piece on top of which the merchants sit. It’s like building a highway into these markets and the merchant gets to choose whether they turn on Brazil or Indonesia. Big U.S. companies like Worldpay or Stripe typically will solve for this issue in the U.S. or Europe. We do it for emerging markets.”
Banks should be the backbone of payments, but they were extremely late to e-commerce payments and their lethargy allowed huge payments specialists to appear in their back yard, he said.
“I think payments were underestimated as a cool place to be, banks thought of the as a commodity business so they didn’t pay too much attention to the business.”
He made an exception for Citi which, he said has been a leader in payments.
Each country requires a specific solution, although both the countries and dLocal are learning as they go. Some regulators are borrowing concepts from countries that have earlier e-commerce experience.
They don’t look to the U.S. where state regulators add friction to the market he said, but they do look to Europe. All markets are trying to replicate what has worked elsewhere, although they may have different priorities. Some are concerned about funds being expatriated, others about funds being repatriated, while still others mainly want to support local companies.
dLocal collects the payment in the local currency and converts it to USD or euro, most commonly, to pay the selling company. It does the FX and handles the currency risk by applying a spread greater than the local currency’s fluctuation, and it closes out is positions daily in most countries — hourly in Brazil.
“You never have a boring day in this market,” he observed.
In an ideal world companies could sell and consumers could buy without all this friction — a user in India would have the same way to pay into a U.S. company as a user in New York and all these barriers would cease to exist.
But for now, dLocal is making a good business of helping sellers and buyers overcome these frictions.
“Our goal is to allow the merchant to be agnostic about where the end user is, and the consumer can get the same service in Morocco or India.”

“El robusto volumen de exportaciones semanales de soja no fue suficiente para asegurar nuevas ganancias. Pero, los precios lograron mantenerse en 335 U$S/tn. El mercado permaneció dominado por números algo más ajustados para el inicio de la campaña que lo que se venía previendo (de todas formas, se mantendrían en niveles récord de 24 mill. tn.); y una caída en el nivel de producción de EE.UU. a 99-100 mill. tn.”, informó Grassi.
En tanto, la corredora agregó que “la gripe africana continúa disparando alertas en China. Se reportan nuevos casos y analistas apuntan a una pérdida de stocks del 55% en lo que va del año. A seguir de cerca la campaña sudamericana. En Brasil y Argentina los suelos manifiestan signos de escasez hídrica, y la oferta de precipitaciones podría mostrarse acotada hacia las próximas semanas”.

Más información Fabricantes de maquinaria agrícola le pidieron financiamiento a Sica: “Cerramos otro año difícil” Representantes de CAFMA le plantearon las dificultades del sector al ministro de Producción, quien prometió avances en los próximos meses. Los granos comerciales cerraron la semana con pérdidas generalizadas Tiro, soja y maíz finalizaron la semana de mercados con bajas. Para el caso de la soja, el plano local recortó 200 $/Tn el disponible, y en el ámbito internacional, las pérdidas superaron los 5 u$s/Tn promedio.
“Pocos cambios en un mercado que busca un nuevo equilibrio. Los precios se mantuvieron sobre 153 U$S/tn. Así, se incorpora el escenario de menores stocks iniciales para la nueva campaña, al mismo tiempo que comienza a ingresar la mercadería del nuevo ciclo. En tanto, los operadores aguardan por datos del desempeño exportador. En consenso, esperan ver un volumen comprendido entre 0,4 – 0,8 mill. tn”, señaló Grassi.
Por último, “los futuros de trigo finalizaron prácticamente a la par. El principal elemento que transmite debilidad continúa siendo un mercado de exportación muy competitivo. Así, al trigo americano le cuesta ganar mercados (sobre todo los asiáticos) al encontrarse en una posición desventajosa frente al trigo proveniente de Europa o la región del Mar Negro. Los operadores aguardan por los datos del reporte semanal de exportaciones, sobre el cual estiman ver un volumen que se ubique entre 0,2 – 0,6 mill. tn. (un volumen típicamente bajo para la época del año)”, destaca Grassi.
Y finalizó: “en contra posición, las perspectivas climáticas en distintos países productores brindan respaldo y evitan mayores caídas. La falta de agua en el hemisferio sur podría llevar a nuevos ajustes para la producción de Australia y Argentina”.
Mercado dlocal con bajas para los granos
“En la tarde de hoy, el mercado de granos local contó con ofrecimientos de compras por debajo del día de ayer, y un volumen escaso de operaciones. Por soja, las fábricas locales ofrecieron U$S 235/t por la mercadería con entrega inmediata (U$S 3/t menos que la rueda anterior). Por su parte, el valor propuesto por maíz con descarga inmediata cayó a U$S 128/t, y la oferta por trigo contractual se ubicó en U$S 160/t, destaca la Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario sobre las cotizaciones nacionales de granos.
En el mercado Matba – ROFEX, el contrato de Soja Noviembre´19 opera a U$S 243.9/t.
En cuanto al mercado local, los precios ofrecidos en el recinto de esta Bolsa se ofrecieron los siguientes valores:

A local interdenominational prayer group, Daughters of Virtue, has held a clean-up campaign in Harare’s Central Business District where members urged people to mantain a clean environment.
A local prayer group, Daughters of Virtue, commonly known as Ndadhiniwa Prayer Group, this Saturday took to the streets of Harare in a clean-up campaign which was joined by the First Lady, Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa.
Amai Mnangagwa joined the ladies sweeping pavements and picking up litter in the CBD, a move which was welcomed by public transport operators and vendors operating in the CBD
“We thank the First Lady and the church for this initiative and call on them to make sure we have running water,” said some city dwellers.
Business in the CBD came to a stand-still as some people jostled to catch a glimpse of the First Lady among the sweepers.
Daughters of Virtue prayer group founder, Prophet Memory Matimbire, said it is everyone’s duty to make sure that the environment is always clean
“It is our duty, this is our city so we have to make sure it is clean always,” said Prophetess Matimbire.
After the clean up, the First Lady called on local authorities to ensure all public places have access to clean running water and there are bins and shelters at all bus stops especially now as we approach the rainy season.

Zambia has praised its bilateral relations with Zimbabwe which have seen the two countries undertaking bi-national economic projects some in the energy sector.
Zambia marked its 55th independence anniversary on the 24th of October and the local embassy celebrated the occasion at a colourful ceremony in Harare.
The country’s envoy to Zimbabwe, Ambassador Emmanuel Tawana Chenda took the opportunity to praise the blossoming bilateral relations that have seen the two countries jointly implementing the Batoka Gorge Electricity Project.
“ As we celebrate our independence, today let me hasten to take note of how Zambia appreciates its cooperation with Zimbabwe especially in terms of the investment in energy sector at the Batoka Gorge Project. This is going to ensure that the countríes jointly generate two thousand four hundred mega watts of electricity which will support the industrialization of the two nations,” said Ambassador Chenda.
The Batoka Gorge Hydro Electricity Project is estimated to cost US4,5 billion and is being undertaken on a Build, Operate and Transfer basis by General Electric of the United States of America.
Two power stations with an installed capacity of one thousand two hundred (1200) mega watts each will be constructed along the Zambezi River on the border between the two countries.

Tens of Thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets today to march in protest against the illegally imposed sanctions by the west in the wake of a string of economic woes facing the nation largely because of Sanctions.
Singing and waving placards, denouncing sanctions, the protesters gathered at the Robert Mugabe Square where the march started from.
Women, men and youths marched from the Robert Mugabe square to the National Sports Stadium marking the SADC solidarity day against western sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe, the inaugural anti sanctions day .
The general populace of Zimbabwe that took to the streets to march today expressed their displeasure at the illegally imposed sanctions highlighting how they have made lives of ordinary citizens very difficult.
In an interview with ZBCNewsonline, individuals who took part in the march said sanctions were making their day to day lives difficult.
“Sanctions must go, right now as youths we are suffering, we do not have jobs because of sanctions,” said a 24 year old youth Forget Majuru.
“We do not want sanctions they should be removed,”said another youth, Naison Tapfuma
“I am doing this because am suffering due to sanctions. I am struggling to fend for my kids however the problem is many of us are blinded because of political affiliations to a point they do not realise that these sanctions affect everyone regardless of political affiliation,” said Patience Tafirenyika a 40 year old woman who was at the march.
“For someone like me who is physically challenged sanctions have made it difficult for me to afford my medication and to even visit the doctor for checkups. Economically things are very tough so these sanctions need to go!” said a 60 year-old man from Chinhoyi.
The march in Harare from Robert Mugabe Square to the National Sports Stadium was led by the first lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa together with the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Professor Amon Murwira, who marched together with the masses.

As Zimbabwe this Tuesday joined the rest of the world in commemorating the International Day of Rural Women, a call has been made to acknowledge their voices and role in economic development.
Addressing a media briefing in Harare this Tuesday, Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Minister Dr Sithembiso Nyoni noted that the inclusion of women in the development agenda will go a long way in growing the national economy.
She said there is need to acknowledge the voices of rural women, taking note of their diversity, roles and circumstances.
The theme for this year, “Rural Women and Girls building climate resilience”, underscores the need for collective effort against combating climate change since rural women are at the fore front of the battle lines when natural resources and agriculture are threatened.
The United Nations’ (UN) international Day of Rural Women celebrates and acknowledges the role of rural women on 15 October each year. It recognizes rural women’s importance in enhancing agricultural and rural development.
United Nations Women says rural women and girls worldwide face daily challenges of access to sustainable infrastructure, services and social protection.
In a statement, UN Women said, “The ubiquity of these challenges offers a large scope for change so that they no longer dominate and constrain women’s and girls’ lives.”
UN Women said rural women make up 43% of the agricultural labour force in developing countries, in work that is time and labour-intensive, informal and poorly paid, with little social protection or income security.
“Child labour is prevalent in rural areas, with girls forming a significant part of the agricultural workforce. Women and girls are responsible for water collection in 80% of households without access to safe drinking water. This work is arduous and will only become harder as water shortages increase.
“The journey to collect water also poses safety risks. Without adequate water and sanitation facilities, women and girls are exposed to illness, violence and other risks to their safety. These deficits also hamper their ability to get a good education, earn an income and move around freely.”
UN Women further said fuel collection, which can take as much as five hours every day, and cooking with unclean fuels can result in long-term and even fatal health problems for women. “In countries that rely heavily on fuels like coal, wood, manure or crop waste for cooking, women account for 6 out of every 10 premature deaths through household air pollution.
“Sustainable infrastructure, services and social protection are central to progress. Measures to improve their delivery can bring both immediate relief and lifelong benefits. For instance, enhanced access to safe drinking water and sanitation brings gains in girls’ education when children stay longer in school, as well as increases in women’s paid work to generate goods and provide services. Extending the reach of water grids and continuous piped drinking water to rural communities is therefore an important priority with multiple benefits,” noted UN Women.
UN Women noted that rural women’s civil society organizations, enterprises and cooperatives are critical in mobilizing rural women, supporting their voice, agency and representation in political and economic spheres, and enabling them to influence the decisions and institutions that affect their lives.
In marking International Day of Rural Women, UN Women urged the international community to work with rural women and girls everywhere and to invest in the sustainable infrastructure, services and social protection that can revolutionize their livelihoods, well-being and resilience.

The First Lady, Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa, has encouraged women to shun stigma and get screened for cancer in order to access treatment at an early stage.
She was speaking in Mhangura, Mashonaland West Province, where more than 200 000 people benefited from the First Lady’s free cervical and breast cancer screening programme.
The free cervical and breast cancer screening campaign programme continues to gather momentum and has moved from provincial to district levels to allow for marginalised communities to benefit.
The First Lady who is also the Ambassador of Health in the country has encouraged women to take advantage of the programme and get screened.
“We need to seek medical attention and undergo testing. Our health is important and let’s shun stigma,” said Amai Mnangagwa.
Last week, the first lady took the programme to Manicaland province where many women also benefited from cervical cancer screening.
In Mhangura, apart from the cancer awareness campaign programme, the First Lady took the opportunity to interact with members of the community where issues of domestic violence, rape and child marriages were discussed.
The session was interactive with members of the community getting an opportunity to openly discuss these problematic issues where women are the most affected.

India is big, no question about that. EY
estimates that India’s global middle class will grow from 50 million people in 2010 to 200 million in 2020, and to 475 million in 2030, almost the size of the whole European Union . Millions of Indians are jumping into the smartphone bandwagon. In Q3 2018, an eye-popping 42.6
million smartphones were sold in India. That is just shy of the number of iPhones Apple sold
globally
in the same period ( 46.9 million ). (Full disclosure: Author owns stock in Apple.) You do not need to wait until 2030. According to The Economist (paywall), there are over 500 million internet connections in India, and Indians use more mobile data than most European phone users
in large part because data costs are so low.
Global e-commerce and other internet companies are keeping an eye on the Indian market. However, those of us who work in cross-border payments in this market know that challenges abound. First, the definition of middle class in India is not quite the same as in Europe or the United States If you plan to sell into India, you need to make sure that you create products and price them accordingly. For example, Spotify priced its service at the equivalent of $1.67, one-sixth of its price in the United States.
But price is not all. Most consumers have skipped the PC and gone straight to smartphones, so you need to make sure your product can support mobile-only customers. Most of the smartphones sold in the country are low-end Android devices, and some, like the basic Jio phone, barely qualify as a smartphone. In fact, Apple is not even in the top five list of highest-selling smartphones in the country.
The payments issue is also a major hurdle to overcome. As of January, there were 45 million credit cards in the country, compared to 931 million debit cards. Unfortunately, most of those debit cards cannot be used online in the same way as in other countries. First, many of those cards are not Visa or Mastercard: 65% of all transactions were done through the Rupay and UPI payment systems. The UPI (short for Unified Payments Interface) system is particularly interesting. It provides a unified layer on top of most bank accounts and wallets. Transactions are initiated by the merchant using a unified user identifier but need to be approved by the user from his or her smartphone.
On top of that complexity, the Reserve Bank of India (India’s central bank) mandates the use of a one-time password (OTP) sent via text, for all card transactions above 2,000 rupees, the equivalent of $29 as of this writing. Any transaction not verified that way is simply rejected. But even implementing OTP is not enough. India is leapfrogging the plastic and beginning to embrace mobile payments instead. This trend was driven in large part by demonetization, the removal in 2016 of all high-denomination banknotes, and by advanced systems such as UPI. Unfortunately, none of the e-wallets nor UPI can currently onboard a merchant from abroad.
Another key thing to consider is whether or not to establish a local presence in the country. Having a local presence makes it easier to accept payments locally, but it has the additional challenge of a changing tax landscape (for instance, the Goods and Services Tax was launched in 2017, and more changes may be coming), and the difficulty of repatriating profits. Selling across the border is simpler, but it does not apply for all products, and you’d need to ensure your cross-border payment aggregator supports the payment methods mentioned above.
So, if you want to sell to India, you need to make sure:
• You evaluate carefully whether to have a local establishment or invoice from abroad.
• You accept e-wallets, UPI and debit cards.
• Your integration supports one-time passwords.
• You’re ready to withstand market changes as new players join and regulations quickly change.
The Indian market represents a huge opportunity for those who make the effort to adapt to it. This means having an adequate product, pricing it according to the purchase power of the Indian consumer and having the right mix of payment methods.

Last year, at the age of 25 and while serving as chief executive officer of fintech firm AstroPay, Sebastián Kanovich felt the frustrations that many retailers, brands and consumers face while trying to do business online and globally: cross-border transactions are a hassle.
So the executive cofounded (and now serves as chief executive officer at) dLocal, which describes itself as “a cross-border payments platform that focuses on enabling e-commerce businesses in the U.S. and Europe to expand into emerging markets.” Here, Kanovich explains the origins of the firm, its goals and business trends he’s seeing in the cross-border market.
WWD: Why did you spin off dLocal from AstroPay?
Sebastián Kanovich: Growing up in Uruguay, I often had to look for creative ways to pay for products that I wanted. International businesses often don’t account for customers in the developing world, and when I wanted something online, I had to look to merchants based in Brazil or Argentina who adapted their sites for regional customers. Most U.S. web sites were out of reach for me, and even though I had a Visa [credit card], it didn’t work for international transactions.
At some point, I did get a card that was approved for international payments, and even ended up sharing it with my grandmother. Most of the country, as well as the whole Latin American region, was in a similar situation. This made it difficult to pay online for physical and digital goods, which, in turn, tremendously inflated the prices for international goods at local retailers.
I knew that payments in emerging markets had to change so that we could level the playing field for people everywhere and make e-commerce a truly global experience. I joined AstroPay, a company that provides a pre-paid credit card to consumers in Latin America, enabling them to pay for international transactions. Then last year, at age 25, I cofounded dLocal to give e-commerce companies, marketplaces and other online businesses a viable way to succeed in emerging markets.
Many e-commerce companies would like to expand their sales into emerging markets, but lack the expertise, knowledge and infrastructure to safely and easily establish a presence and accept the multitude of locally relevant payment options that are prevalent in these markets. DLocal was created to solve cross-border payment challenges for e-commerce businesses, enabling them to securely sell their products and services to more than two billion consumers in emerging markets, including Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, China, Turkey and more.
WWD: How do merchants and retail companies use dLocal? What are the benefits?
S.K.: With just one API [application program interface] integration, dLocal offers a stress-free payment integration for its partners, and supports more than 200 local country-specific payment methods. DLocal also caters to specific consumer preferences in each market, with support for local cards, installments, bank transfers, e-wallets, direct debit and cash payments.
This allows merchants to reach all the potential buyers in a local market rather than just a fraction of them, and eliminates the need to set up local entities or undergo heavy operational and tax burdens, which can slow or simply prevent companies from selling their products and services in these growing economies.
This local approach to handling payments has helped simplify market entry and lift payment conversions by as much as 40 percent. For many of our merchant customers, working with dLocal has become a game-changer, as they’ve tried to enter some of these markets before, but ran into many obstacles including limited consumer reach and inability to repatriate their earnings back to the U.S. or Europe.
WWD: What are some key trends in payments that you see emerging this year? And long-term?
S.K.: Looking at payments through a global (rather that U.S.-based) lens, 2017 is not going to be a year of leap-frog innovations, but rather a year of incremental improvements focused on country-by-country wins. As mobile infrastructure continues to expand and the Internet reaches an additional two billion people in markets where access was previously nonexistent, we’re bound to see a spike in demand for online and mobile purchases.
At the same time, the payment methods landscape will only become more fragmented, requiring payment platforms to optimize between multiple payment options, acquirers and processors, handle currency conversions cost-effectively and transparently, and account for numerous legislative nuances across multiple markets. Decades-old payments systems won’t cut here.
Merchants will have to find partners that understand the changing global landscape, able to develop deep local know-how in a diverse set of markets, and have the technical prowess to build a flexible, modern, globally ready payments technology platform that can play well with numerous ecosystem players, easily integrate with merchants’ internal systems of record, as well as process a serious flow of cross-border payments securely while delivering high approval rates.
Additionally, while we can expect a significant shift towards several common payment methods, it will happen gradually and may take as long as a couple of decades. In the meantime, merchants and payment platforms will need to support their global presence with a localized payment strategy, because even in developed markets like Slovenia, Poland, and Estonia, credit-card access is hardly universal.
WWD: What is your biggest goal for dLocal to achieve?
S.K.: Our dream is to close the remaining digital divide gap through borderless payments. In doing so, we hope to level the playing field worldwide by providing equal access for people in countries that need it the most. We want to create a world where people in emerging markets have the choices that many of us in the U.S. and Europe take for granted, such as: tracking down the least expensive way to buy certain things, then buying them in a matter of a just a few clicks; taking an online course or listening to a paid podcast to improve our earning potential; making extra income by freelancing for a business that could be on the other side of the world, or renting a room in our apartment to a traveler from another country.
Now that reliable Internet access is becoming a reality for most populations around the world, giving people the ability to pay for goods they need or desire, as well as receive payments for services they can render is the missing link. Without localized payments that work seamlessly for both consumers and businesses, none of this is feasible.

Study Shows Doing Business Globally Can Increase Payment Errors

Story 15
Latin America has become one of the most sought-after emerging e-commerce markets. As retailers have seen in the shifting emerging economies of India and Asia-Pacific, the pathway into new markets isn’t always laid out, especially for brands without a local presence.
As developed markets show less growth opportunities for international brands, merchants are turning to LATAM’s $63 billion e-commerce markets where smartphones and Internet penetration are converging with high social media usage to accelerate the growth and increased sophistication of e-commerce.
The potential for high-growth is promising, but not without a nuance for navigating the complexity of the LATAM region, where restricted access to banking, low credit card penetration and idiosyncratic online buying behaviors make for a tricky entrance, particularly for those who do it from afar. Like any challenge though, if there is a will, there is a way.
For a globally-minded company such as Avast, whose digital security products are used by more than 400 million people across the globe, the fragmented LATAM markets could have posed a challenge. Instead, the company’s ‘Go Local’ strategy turned Avast into the largest consumer security provider in the region, with about 85 million active users. Key to Avast’s ‘Go Local’ approach is understanding and catering to their local users’ needs at every step of the user experience journey. Avast, who partnered with dLocal (for transparency sake, I happen to be the CEO of dLocal) to deliver and manage country-specific payment options across Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, reports that the ability to offer all the locally-relevant payment methods to its customers, down to the country level, was the key to capturing a sizable portion of the market in LATAM.
In looking at Avast’s success in the region, Cristian Gallardo, Regional Manager for LATAM at Avast, said: “Our LATAM users appreciate that we listen and tailor our offerings and selling process to their needs. This has been the key to helping us reach a 35% year-over-year growth in the region.”
Avast, like other user-centric companies such as Uber and Home Depot, began with the development of a custom, in-product checkout flow for a user experience in the local currency and in the preferred language. Importantly, it also featured all the relevant payment methods for their country, even off-line payment options and localized customer support.
Go Local or Go Home
Avast, headquartered in the Czech Republic, first launched the free version of its security software in 2001 in LATAM. It spread to millions of users in a matter of months. The problem was that users who wanted to upgrade their device protection, couldn’t purchase a subscription without an international credit card. However, local credit and debit cards can account for 25%-60% of e-commerce transactions, depending on country. For Avast, local cards ended up playing an even more important role – accounting for as much as 80% of their sales in the region.
Avast also found that by offering local cards, banks transfers and cash payments in its cross-border payments mix, they could significantly lift checkout conversions. Reflecting the diversity of the countries it served, the payment mix and local preferences were varied, yet the result were equally impressive, ranging from a boost in checkout conversion of 15% in Mexico to 25% in Argentina, Chile and Colombia.
To reach their full potential in this fast-growing region and unlock the pent-up demand for its products, Avast decided to focus on their users’ needs. By implementing a Go Local strategy anchored on offering a truly localized product and payment experience Avast has seized the opportunity and grown its regional revenue by 35% year over year.
Today, we still encounter many brands who assume that international credit cards are the holy grail of cross-border e-commerce. While they are important, they only are part of the local story. To cross borders as a trusted, user-centric brand and capture a strong foothold in the local markets, companies need to present a hyper-localized user experience that embraces the nuances of a diverse region, local infrastructure and users’ payment preferences.

Story 16
You might expect the woeful state of global financial inclusion to be a concern for the UN or a non-profit, but not necessarily a social media giant like Facebook. But banking the unbanked is now apparently a core mission-statement for Mark Zuckerberg's baby, via its cryptocurrency, Libra.
"1.7 billion adults globally remain outside of the financial system with no access to a traditional bank, even though one billion have a mobile phone," Facebook's documents about Libra point out. It's a statistic that is easy to forget in a world of ubiquitous ATMs and credit cards.
One country Facebook could be targeting when it launches the token in 2020 is Venezuela. According to The World Bank's 2017 figures, 9.5 million Venezuelan adults are currently unbanked, just under 30% of the adult population. That proportion increases if you count their dependents. Meanwhile, those who are banked currently face extreme levels of inflation, meaning the worth of their bolivars, sitting in national vaults, diminish in value every day. No doubt, having access to a stable global currency could help encourage savings and accumulate wealth.
But it's worth unpacking the practical reality at play. What would Facebook need to do to "bank" people, and get them using or storing funds? Or is this just so much PR bromide?
What it takes: on-ramps
The main question here is how the unbanked will get money on to the platform. In other words, if I have Venezuelan bolivars, how do I convert that into Libra?
One solution they might take inspiration from is "Mobile Money", which launched in 2007 in Kenya, masterminded by Vodafone. Here, subscribers simply exchange cash for mobile credit (like from Vodafone) at one of thousands of telecoms kiosks located across host countries. Independent, small agents effectively act as cash depositors, allowing users to digitally store their earnings, receive wages and social welfare. They can also pay their bills with a simple text message thanks to a synergy between regional telecom giants and banks, which allows credit to be transferred into a working currency. In Kenya alone, where Vodafone initiated the service with the launch of “MPESA”, the percentage of unbanked citizens has halved in the ten years hence. In that time, it has spread to 92 countries and counting, with a reported half-billion people from Eastern Africa to Latin America granted banking access through its phones.
Perhaps Facebook plans to let users exchange their bolivars for Libra tokens at kiosk providers? Still, that doesn't solve the issue for the most rural parts of the world however, which even mobile money providers are struggling to access.
Another theory is that Facebook will reward social media users with Libra, rather than having people solely "cash in". If users can simply "earn" Libra for liking photos and other engagements, then theoretically Venezuelans can pay their local Caracas grocer digitally too - meaning users totally bypass cash and rely solely on Libra. Still, that doesn't seem entirely realistic considering it would take a lot of Facebook engagements to feed a family.
The other option is to partner with existing fintech firms in emerging markets, who can simply integrate Facebook's digital currency. It's not totally crazy; Philippines-based Coins and dLocal, a b2b payments provider for emerging markets, already seem to be ready to embracing cryptocurrencies. Libra may be their next chosen solution, although it'll be a slow process.
What it takes: friendly institutions
Although Facebook says that Libra will be global and therefore without regulation, there are limits to that sentiment, because their associates will have to ensure they implement appropriate KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures.
"It will be very hard for Facebook to launch something like Bitcoin. Think about it – they haven't even done anything yet and they are already getting pushback from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee," says Nevin Freeman, co-founder of Reserve, whose stablecoin is also hoping to lift Venezuela out of disarray.
"Are they going to operate a service that they maintain control of, which can be accessed anonymously by anyone, and withstand pressures from the government to add KYC and exclude high-risk users? Are they going to publish a decentralized system that works like Bitcoin, and then tell the government they should not be held responsible since they can't change it anymore? Both of these outcomes seem unlikely," he added.

AnaCap-backed payment services provider heidelpay has announced the acquisition of Universum Group in Germany. heidelpay reports that this is their 5th acquisition since 2017. Details of the acquisition were not disclosed.
Based in Heidelberg, the heidelpay Group is a fintech service provider in the international payment processing space. heidelpay uses in-house developed solutions to provide payments via invoice, installment payments, direct debit, direct payment, and prepayment – and for providers of credit cards or wallet solutions. heidelpay is authorized by the German Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).
Universum is a Frankfurt-based payment service and debt collection provider that specializes in “PayLater” solutions in the DACH region for e-commerce merchants. Their platform covers the entire receivables lifecycle, credit-checking to recovery once debt collection is required, both in Germany and globally.
Mirko Hüllemann, founder and CEO of heidelpay, said this latest acquisition is an important milestone for their future.
“Universum and heidelpay have an established track record of working together in a close and successful manner – so the takeover was a logical next step for both parties. We will now look to drive growth and offer solutions along the entire payment supply chain from a single source. FlexiPay, the white label solution for PayLater and installments, is already integrated smoothly into all product offerings by heidelpay.”
heidelpay said they continue to experience significant growth trajectory with revenues increasing more than 5.5x to €90 million and transaction volume expected to reach €8 billion, driven by a 5x increase in the number of transactions to 140 million.
Tassilo Arnhold, Managing Director at AnaCap Financial Partners LLP, said they continue to pursue their goal of creating a “market leading, omni-channel and multi-jurisdiction payment solutions provider in the DACH region.”

Story 19
Yet again Scotland won’t be there but all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.
The action is already well under way and today The Tele’s look at the tournament continues with our lowdown on the teams that make up Group C in the opening stages.
Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating nation.
Group D
Argentina
The beaten finalists in Brazil four years ago, they will be right up there among the favourites, though a 6-1 friendly defeat against Spain earlier this year is hardly confidence inspiring.
Any team led by the magical talent of Messi, however, has to be rated potential winners. And if he is to challenge for the title of the greatest player of all time, the Barcelona attacker probably needs to win a World Cup.
He turns 31 during the finals, so this might be his last chance to do that.
Star player: Lionel Messi.
Local link: Dundee caused a sensation back in 2000 when they signed Argentina World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.
At the time they already had Fabian Caballero, Juan Sara and Beto Carranza on their books. Another Argentine, Beto Nevada, had brief spells at Dundee and United.
United greats Dave Narey and Paul Hegarty also battled it out with the great Diego Maradona in a Scotland v Argentina friendly at Hampden back in 1979. Maradona won.
Croatia
They finished third when still a new nation back in 1998 in France but have flattered to deceive at times since.
What they always have is a crop of players talented enough to cause shocks if they hit a run of form and, if they can get out of the group, the Croatians could progress further.
Star player: Luka Modric.
Local link: Dragutin Ristic’s name might seem longer than the time he lasted in spells at Dundee and Dundee United but he did make first-team appearances and was born in what is now Croatia.
Although born in Bosnia, one-time non-scoring Dundee United striker Darko Bodul considers himself Croatian and did represent them at U/21 level, as did another ex-Tangerine Mihael Kovacevic.
Iceland
The shock troops of Euro 2016 in France, the Icelandic team could melt a few more hearts in Russia.
They did, of course, beat England in those Euros and apart from making them popular in these parts, it shows they are a unit that’s decent, if not always pleasing on the eye.
Star player: Gylfi Sigurdsson.
Local link: The Dundee legend that is Barry Smith had a spell in Icelandic football, as did United’s 1994 Scottish Cup winner David Hannah.
Heading the other way was one-time wonder boy of European football, Siggi Jonsson, who had an injury-hit spell at Tannadice late in his career.
Last, but not least, Tele columnist Lee Wilkie’s one Scotland goal came against Iceland.
Nigeria
The Super Eagles are now familiar faces at World Cup finals and know their way around tournaments like this.
This will be their sixth finals appearance since 1994 and they’ll be looking to make it through the group for a fourth time.
If they do that and progress one round further, it will represent their best-ever showing.
Star player: Alex Iwobi.
Local link: Seeing as in Nigeria “Dundee United” is slang for idiot (it relates to a disastrous early 70s visit there), at least half our city might not be shouting for the Super Eagles.
Their U/15 side were popular visitors to Dens Park during the 1989 U/15s World Cup.

Story 20
Machine learning, AI, predictive analytics, and other flourishing technologies are remaking the business landscape today. A brave new world is upon us, where every industry from agriculture to healthcare and commerce to advertising is innovating exponentially. The leaders and visionaries ushering in this exciting new era are the entrepreneurs behind the brilliant platforms being developed. Below are 20 innovative technology companies transforming their industries and moving the needle forward for all of us.
Argus Cybersecurity
A leader in a rapidly expanding market, Argus is a cybersecurity firm focused on cars. Just five years ago, the need for a company like Argus would have been marginal. But since the company's founding in 2013, so many new cars have hit the road with "connected" features that car-hacking has become a pressing concern. When self-driving vehicles eventually make their way to consumers, car cybersecurity will take on even greater urgency. Based in Tel Aviv with offices in the U.S., Germany, and Japan, Argus works with car manufacturers and their suppliers. The company's staff includes longtime cybersecurity experts as well as auto industry veterans who have helped to make Argus a go-to shop for cybersecurity on wheels.
BigCommerce
The dilemma for many e-tailers today is whether to focus on building their own online stores or dedicate themselves to selling through Amazon. BigCommerce allows them to do both with little incremental gain in cost and labor. BigCommerce builds and hosts online stores and provides the software to manage them. From the BigCommerce dashboard, retailers can manage listings, inventory, and payments in their own store as well as simultaneous listings with Amazon, Facebook, and eBay. The Austin-based company offers differentiated products--and pricing plans--for upstarts and high-volume brands, including Camelbak and Martha Stewart. Founded in 2009, the company has raised $155 million from investors such as General Catalyst and American Express Ventures.
ControlUp
ControlUp allows a company to monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot its entire IT infrastructure from a single dashboard. In a sense, it is like having a whole IT staff carrying out maintenance, providing early warning signs, and sharing insights around the clock--which frees up actual personnel to do other work that produces value. With a base of 500 enterprise customers, ControlUp has collected valuable data of its own. It feeds all of the data it collects back into algorithms that help detect its customers' IT problems early, identify where costs can be cut and share other insights. In many cases, ControlUp can even intervene automatically to fix bugs. When it can't, it flags problems for a company's staff. The company raised $10 million in March.
dLocal
dLocal is a platform that enables e-commerce companies and marketplaces to sell to consumers in emerging markets. The San Francisco-headquartered startup, founded last year, handles the merchant processing, backend and compliance for online payments from countries that Western companies find traditionally difficult to sell to, for a variety of reasons. These include fraud, regulation, tax complexity and others. By partnering with dLocal, a company can gain access to sell its products and services in dozens of markets - including Latin America, China and India - without assuming the country-by-country localization costs and fraud risks. With the ever-increasing trend towards globalization, dLocal seems to have picked the right niche at the right moment.
Exabeam
In the arms race between cybersecurity experts and hackers, the good guys often seem to be a step behind. The problem is that by the time they have developed tools to detect and repel the latest malware, hackers have developed something new. Exabeam, a cybersecurity firm in San Mateo, CA, has created an alternative approach. Rather than looking for hacking tools, Exabeam's technology monitors human behavior on a company's networks. Relying on big data analytics, it can identify suspicious activity and notify security teams. This user-behavior approach is particularly useful for protecting against insider threats--attempts at hacking or sabotage from employees or contractors who have regular access to a network. In a worst case scenario, Exabeam's software can also be deployed as a forensics tool to analyze an attack that has already occurred.
Feelter
What if online shopping became an experience where peer reviews and ratings from across the web were curated and accessible next to any product on any retailer's site? Feelter has made this a reality by creating a platform that enables an e-tailer to automatically aggregate consumer feedback from review sites and social networks and present the data in a simple screen layover next to every product on its site. The benefit? Bring wisdom and truth from the crowd right to each product on your site, in order to increase consumer confidence and conversions (or alert you to problematic products and what can be improved). The Tel Aviv startup has raised $4 million in funding and won GMIC's global startup competition last year.
Floored
A standout in real estate technology, Floored created a new product category in a staid industry. Founded as a 3D modeling software firm in 2012, Floored "backed into real estate," in the words of its founder David Eisenberg. While considering the process of leasing commercial real estate, he sensed an opportunity. Potential tenants would walk through empty spaces and compare metrics like square footage, while never getting a clear sense of how an office would look until they hired architects. He wondered how much more effective brokers could be in closing deals if they could show prospective tenants something more compelling. Today, Floored creates immersive, 3D models of offices that brokers can share during the leasing process. Tenants get the opportunity to digitally "walk through" a furnished, fully designed office before making a decision. In January, CBRE, one of the world's biggest real estate companies, bought Floored--and hired its management team--for an undisclosed sum
Kaltura
Kaltura has become a leader in delivering video online. If you've ever watched a video on the web, you've probably used Kaltura's technology without knowing it. Part of the reason Kaltura has become widespread--if, largely, invisible--is its relentless development of new video technologies. Today, the company's products include everything from its bread-and-butter online video platform for organizations to a full OTT offering for media companies. Kaltura's apps also support integration with almost any third-party software its customers might want to use, ranging from Moodle and Sakai to IBM Connections and Drupal. Rumored to be worth more than $1 billion, the New York-based, Israel-founded company has moved firmly out of startup territory even if it remains a nimble innovator.
Movable Ink
Movable Ink has created a platform for highly customizable marketing emails. Movable Ink refers to its emails as "containers" for content because they can be filled with just about anything--text, video, account information--at any time. In fact, the content of the email isn't even determined until a recipient clicks to open it. At that moment, Movable Ink's software accounts for where the recipient is, what time it is, and what device she is using, among other variables. Then it fills the "container" with the content it predicts is most likely to grab her attention. The company's case studies boast impressive results, like the doubling of click-through rates. The New York-based startup's client list currently boasts a diverse set of businesses including The New York Times, Delta, and McDonald's.
Nextiva
Tomas Gorny has been on a mission to improve business communication for over a decade. After the turn-of-the-century, enterprise phone systems were still unaffordable, unreliable and hard to use. Gorny formed Nextiva to create a user-friendly and reliable phone system for SMBs and enterprises at an affordable price. A decade later, Arizona-based Nextiva has become a leading VoIP provider with 150,000 business customers, 800 employees and $125 million in annual revenue. But Gorny's vision of improving how businesses communicate doesn't stop there. The company is rolling out a brand-new platform, NextOS, which will combine every aspect of the business communication ecosystem - including phone, chat, CRM, surveys and others - into a cohesive customer sentiment analysis tool that helps businesses better understand and cater to each individual user. NextOS will be released at the company's upcoming annual conference, NextCon, which is aptly focused on how businesses can improve their customer experience.
OptimalPlus
Imagine an autonomous car's hardware systems freezing, malfunctioning or breaking down in the middle of a drive. Or picture your smartphone catching fire during a flight. Well, the latter doesn't need to be conceptualized since it already happened with Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. In our world of rapidly accelerating innovation and transition towards electronic systems, there are tremendous risks and liabilities if hardware quality isn't maximized and defects minimized. Enter OptimalPlus, an Israel-based manufacturing analytics platform that uses big data to reduce the number of defective parts manufactured in electronics and semiconductors. The awesome thing about this platform is that it doesn't just detect and alert problems, it also diagnoses what needs to be done to fix them, and impressively, actively implements the necessary solutions without human intervention. In a world where everything is connected and technological, ensuring the integrity of systems is more important than ever - which is why OptimalPlus seems to have struck gold.
Pulsate
Dublin-based Pulsate was founded in 2013 to help brick-and-mortar businesses manage iBeacons. iBeacons were then a newly introduced technology, developed by Apple, that allowed businesses to transmit information to nearby consumers using Bluetooth. For example, iBeacons allow retailers to share deals or pull up loyalty programs in proprietary apps. Since its founding, Pulsate has evolved into a more comprehensive mobile retail platform. In addition to iBeacon support, it now embeds chat features and e-commerce functions in its customers' mobile apps. Current customers include Paypal, Telepizza, and Coors Light. The venture-backed startup has raised a bit less than $3 million in two funding rounds.
Rain
Rain, a small L.A.-based startup, seems to have cracked the code for hyperlocal mobile advertising. The key is serving ads to users in apps they use frequently and while on the move--like Waze and Instagram. Rain's clients--including chains like McDonald's and CVS--use Rain to offer potential customers deals when they are just a few blocks away from a retail location. (In Waze, users can simply tap a button that says "Drive There" to take advantage of a deal.) If a user interacts with an ad, but doesn't act on it, Rain can "re-market" to the same user by following him through other apps and the mobile web. On the backend, Rain offers detailed analytics so advertisers can track engagement and conversion rates--leaving no question about ROI.
Socrata
Seattle-based Socrata is a leader in creating technology platforms for government. In partnership with local, state, and federal government agencies, Socrata turns public government records into tools. In Dallas and Baltimore, police departments have partnered with Socrata to monitor and report data on violent encounters between officers and the public. In Douglas County, Kansas, Socrata has digitized the annual budget. In Massachusetts, it has analyzed and published state financial information so that agencies and the public can more easily draw insights from it. At agencies throughout the country, Socrata has provided or created tools to help governments track performance of public initiatives. Founded in 2007 with venture capital backing, Socrata has raised $55 million of equity investments to date.
StartApp
In our ever-increasing mobile driven world, applications and companies at large have opportunities to reach, penetrate and monetize markets like never before. But with the endless amount of users, interactions and data available, who can make sense of it all? New York-based StartApp is an insights driven mobile company that empowers app developers, social companies and other types of businesses to understand their users, better connect and engage with them, as well as improve monetization. The company started as a mobile ad network and collected so much data across so many devices that it began to leverage the insights it had gained by selling them to businesses. StartApp is now a one-stop mobile powerhouse, offering its legacy ad network to monetize and reach users, an ad unit creation service, data that helps businesses better understand their users, and a content creation offering.
Turbonomic
Boston-based Turbonomic provides a platform that predicts demand on network resources and distributes cloud computing power to meet it. It does this with what it calls an "autonomic platform" that constantly runs supply and demand simulations and has the power to auto-regulate complex cloud environments. The result is much more efficient and stable networks, which ultimately allows companies to move even more of their computing to the cloud. The company's technology appears to be unique, which has attracted a flood of investment. Turbonomic has raised over $100 million and reportedly has been in recent talks with Cisco about a potential acquisition.
Vestmark
Vestmark provides a wealth management platform to professional financial advisors. Major customers include Fidelity Investment and Edward Jones. Overall, Vestmark's software handles 1.5 million accounts with a total of $500 billion in assets. The software can handle the digital side of almost every aspect of account management, from monitoring stock trading to reporting account balances to clients. But perhaps the most valuable function is compliance. Vestmark helps its customers remain compliant with the thicket of ever-changing rules and regulations that govern their business. In an age when the political pendulum can swing quickly from regulation to deregulation and when federal rules are frequently reinterpreted, automated help with compliance is more than a convenience--it's a business necessity. In the past year and a half alone Vestmark has raised $37 million in equity investments as it has continued to update and expand its software.
VisiSonics
After ten years of academic investigation at the University of Maryland, the researchers behind VisiSonics brought their "3D audio" technology to market in 2012. Now it will serve as the audio that pairs with virtual reality experiences delivered through Oculus headsets. VisiSonic's technology allows virtual reality developers to include location-specific sound in their VR games and films. The sound of footsteps, for example, can "come from" behind you; when you turn you will hear the footsteps approaching you. Remarkably, this 3D audio experience is delivered through normal stereo headphones. Recording in 3D, on the other hand, requires special hardware: a spherical microphone developed by VisiSonics that records sound and location data with "pinpoint accuracy," the company claims. Ultimately, this kind of immersive audio will be necessary to create fully immersive VR experiences.
Zebra Medical Vision
One of the most valuable sources of health science data has usually been off-limits to researchers: clinical medical records. Zebra is aiming to change that by compiling and analyzing vast troves of records. Its objective is two-fold. First, founders Elad Benjamin, Eyal Toledano and Eyal Gura want to make their anonymized, indexed database of clinical records available to scientists as an open research tool. Second, they are using machine learning analysis of the records to develop new diagnostic tools. So far Zebra has released one algorithm that can detect breast cancer at an early stage and others that detect diseases of the liver and arteries. The founders say more algorithms are coming in the second half of 2017. In the long run, Zebra's big data approach to disease detection could help doctors make earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Beyond the health benefits, early diagnosis can be financially valuable--by preventing more costly treatment of advanced diseases.
Zive
Founded by two veterans of the consumer electronics industry, Zive brings what it calls a "humanistic" and "friendly" design philosophy to software. The company's first product, Kiwi for Gmail, converts the entire G Suite of cloud software--including Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Docs--into native desktop apps. It enables users to access all of the functionality of the Google programs from well-designed desktop apps without ever opening a web browser. "The browser is great for content consumption," says Eric Shashoua, Zive's CEO, "but very limiting when it comes to content creation."

12th Street in Manhattan was the scene of the latest rally about the 14th Street busway.
Transportation Alternatives organized the event Wednesday evening to send a message directly to neighbors and the attorney who are suing to stop the complete busway project along the corridor.
Crosstown traffic would not be allowed on the busway from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. and delivery trucks and local pick ups/drop offs would be permitted. The NYC Department of Transportation and MTA hope to speed up bus times along the M 14 routes.
A court is expected to hear the busway case later this year. Opponents argue the city did not study the environmental impact on side streets. The city says the amount of cars would not increase substantially and the agency disputes the data being quoted by the opponents.
A second lawsuit was filed Wednesday against the MTA and NYC DOT to restore some bus stops that were removed along the corridor when it became a Select Bus Route.
Attorney Arthur Schwartz, who lives in the area, is also involved in that case and he held a press conference Wednesday morning with some riders, neighbors and people in the disabled community.

“We will defend against this lawsuit vigorously on behalf of bus riders, who deserve a modern and reliable service that moves people efficiently. Rider advocates observe that it can be faster to walk than take the bus – we’re fixing that. The bus system is fully accessible and far better for the environment than driving in private cars and taxis," said a representative from the MTA's media office.
Before the changes, M14A/D local service had 82 stops. Select Bus Service was created with feedback from riders and meetings with neighbors.
14 stops were removed and 3 were relocated. The MTA says M14 SBS customers do not have to walk more than two extra blocks from a discontinued stop to a SBS stop.

“If you enter these premises you must immediately (within an hour of exiting) announce via press release, video statement, social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) the following statement: ‘I will never run for President of the United States. I’m sorry for wasting everyone’s time on the matter. To be honest, I’m not even sure what I was thinking even flirting with running because no one in my own city thinks I’d do a good job,’ ” the flyer states.

De Blasio, who was reelected in 2017, has reportedly considered entering the already crowded 2020 Democratic field, visiting Iowa in February and telling The New York Times he had “not ruled out a run for president, obviously.”
Neighborhood resident Dave Stevens told the publication he participated in hanging the flyers in hopes they would make the mayor decide against a White House bid.
"Just announce you are running for president and quit as mayor or announce you aren't and focus on making the city better,” Stevens said.
De Blasio is a frequent visitor to the Park Slope gym and has been met by protesters on several occasions.
In October, he refused to engage with a 72-year-old homeless activist who confronted him during his workout and told him that only 5 percent of units in the city’s affordable housing program would go to the homeless. After the incident sparked a backlash, de Blasio agreed to meet with members of homelessness advocacy group Vocal-NY.

Western Union (NYSE:WU), an old tech cross-border payment company has teamed up with Thunes (TransferTo Mobile Financial Services Ltd) to enable Western Union customers to send funds directly into mobile wallets around the world.
Thunes connects diverse payment systems so unbanked or underbanked users gain access to funds and financial services. Thunes’ network makes it possible for Mobile Wallet Operators, Corporations, Merchants, Money Transfer Operators, and Banks to facilitate the real-time movement of funds to and from emerging countries.
Western Union is the original payment tech innovator launching in 1851. Fintech before it existed. Recently, there has been an onslaught of payment platforms that have undermined Western Union’s business model thus the competition is compelling management to update and adapt.
“We are continuously expanding and enhancing our account payout portfolio, providing customers with multiple payout options including bank accounts, cards or mobile wallets,” said Sobia Rahman, Global Head of Account Payout Network for Western Union. “Our goal is to make digital money transfer services more accessible, with a specific focus on enabling mobile transactions.”
Remittances and payments are huge. The World Bank estimates that in 2018, the global remittance market stood at $642 billion and moving higher. While there is plenty to go around, consumers expect immediate transfer at a minuscule cost. Of course, there are plenty of crypto companies sizing up the space. Provide or die.

There are serious and longstanding problems — social, economic, environmental — to solve on pretty much every scale, from global to national to local. It’s frustrating to watch as leaders struggle to come to anything resembling consensus. Stepping back to take a look at the big picture, a question emerges about the degree of bitterness that seems to have seeped in around the edges of our society.
“Why are people so shitty to each other?”
This query is posed by Steve Poulton, central figure of the outstanding avant-soul project Altered Statesman, near the beginning of a short film directed by Price Harrison. The piece accompanies “The Sudden Glamour of Your Glow,” a song from the group’s recent EP Tried as Adults. Poulton, usually a study in effortless cool, stars as himself, and he’s clearly concerned. He’s speaking with his flute-playing therapist, one Webster DuBoyce, Psy.D. (local wind-instrument ace JayVe Montgomery). DuBoyce points to a spiritual issue — not really a religious one, per se, but a broad one to do with the condition of our society.
“I think fundamentally it’s related to the idea that people have bought into the false advertisement that God’s love is finite,” he responds. “And if God’s love is finite, then we must compete with one another for God’s love. We must segregate toward God’s love. We must box each other out toward God’s love. We must build walls toward God’s love. We must build bombs toward God’s love. As you can see, this world has plenty of divisiveness based in God’s love.”
This sets the tone for the song, a contemplation of the kind of universal love you might call compassion. The lyric is generally hopeful, but it points at the heartbreak that comes as part of the present situation, and there’s no pretending that there’s an easy solution to be had.
“Turns out every time the same,” Poulton sings, as Harrison’s camera follows him, some bandmates and other associates around a few locations in the city where things move slowly enough that you can get lost in thought. “Remind me what’s real / Because I’m drawing a blank / Seems like my set needs some adjusting.”
Slow down and take some time with the video above. Altered Statesman doesn’t have any shows on the books right now, but watch their Facebook profile for updates, and buy their records via their Bandcamp page.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (June 7, 2018) ­– In Lincoln County, the hottest ticket in town isn't a big concert or hit musical. It's Jack Blair and his wife Thelma, two local farmers, performing on stage at the Lincoln County Extension Office in Stanford, Ky. In the show, Thelma, concerned with Jack's hearing, asks him if he remembered to wear ear plugs before working with his loud farm machinery.
Jack's response: "WHAT?"
The audience, comprising farmers from the surrounding community, roars with laughter.
This isn't Broadway. It's Farm Dinner Theater, a program started by University of Kentucky College of Nursing professor Deborah Reed, Ph.D. Local farmers come together to watch each other perform skits that are humorous to watch, but serious in nature. While they delight in Jack's feigned deafness, it serves as a reminder to use ear protection when working with machines.
Farming is dangerous work. Most farms in Kentucky are family owned and self-regulated, meaning occupational health and safety standards don't apply. With no one looking out for the well-being of farmers, Reed thought about ways to help farmers recognize hazards of their trade and implement safe practices.
"Health and safety topics have always been low on the priority list for farmers," said Reed. "They'll take care of their cattle or their crops long before they take care of themselves."
Lectures are ineffective, as farmers don't have the time or patience, and pamphlets are easy to ignore.
"Based on our research, we found that farmers learned best from watching each other and stories based on real situations," said Reed. "They like humor. From observing farmers and how they choose their work behavior we know they learn from an apprentice model where role modeling is so important."
Add free dinner as an incentive, and with a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Farm Dinner Theater was born.
The actors are real farmers. The scripts are real stories, based on situations the farmers face every day, including tractor rollovers and road safety, hearing conservation, fatigue, fall prevention, animal handling, skin cancer, cataract prevention, and the importance of a good communication plan – something Thelma Blair has already implemented.
"Jack was on the farm by himself, and he had a heart attack," said Thelma. "Now we're sure to let each other know where we'll be and for how long in case of an emergency."
Farmers age 50 and older have a mortality rate three times higher than younger farmers. As Reed says, farmers tend to learn at the elbow of another farmer. They might have a good role model for health and safety, or they might not. The goal of the theater is to move those social norms by identifying potentially dangerous habits and suggesting ways to modify those habits.
The Blairs are well-known and respected in their community. Both are involved with their local UK Agricultural Extension Office as well as the Kentucky Farm Bureau. When asked by the their local extension office agent if they wanted to participate, they jumped at the chance to help their fellow farmers. And they picked up a few tips for themselves.
"We're more cautious about falls, especially when getting on and off equipment," said Thelma. "And I fuss at my husband to wear sunscreen and a hat that protects his ears."
"From a cultural aspect, most farm meetings come with a meal. They love to eat together and talk," said Reed. "One of the major attractions of the theater, in addition to watching your neighbors on stage, is that couples or even families are invited to attend. So the event becomes a 'date night' or an entertainment for the family."
At one event, the children performed a skit about safety on the farm from their perspective. While families loved seeing the children perform, they were reminded about important issues such as how children should never be around chemicals used for the livestock.
One thing Reed didn't anticipate was how the farmers would come together and work out issues among themselves. At one event, a farmer mentioned how his father, who was grappling with Alzheimer's, kept trying to get the keys to the family tractor. Their solution was to move the tractor out sight. Once they did that, he stopped trying to drive it.
"You just moved it?" asked another farmer, seated two tables over. His family had been struggling with the same situation. He turned to his wife. "We can do that."
"It gives them permission to talk about things they otherwise would have never talked about, these sensitive topics," said Reed. "Because they do feel like they're all alone. And then they realize that others in the community are dealing with the same thing."
Not all of those sensitive issues are as serious as Alzheimer's. When Reed emphasized the importance of the power nap, which reduces fatigue and the risk of injury, a few of the farmers confessed among themselves that they napped during the day. Emboldened by these confessions, others resolved to incorporate power naps into their daily routine.
"One of the things we didn't expect to come out of this, is how people are saying it relieved their stress," said Reed. "One of the big topics in farming right now is toxic stress and suicide. Farms are affected by financial downturn. Farmers are either being advised to downsize or declare bankruptcy. So it gives farmers the opportunity to come together, discuss their situations, and to support each other. Non-farm people in the community come to these events and have a better understanding of the stressors that farmers face and can support them better."
The results of these events have been remarkable. Fifty percent of the farmers who attended reported to have incorporated changes in their habits and on their farms within two weeks. Sixty percent made changes within two months. The program was so successful, Reed, who has won numerous awards for the program and was named by Oprah Magazine as "One of Five Nurses Who Might Just Save the World", was appointed UK's first agricultural nurse, the first at a land-grant university. Her position is funded by UK's College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, and marks the beginning of a unique partnership between the colleges of Agriculture and Nursing.
"I'm living my dream," said Reed. "I get to have my clinical practice and help farmers."
As an agricultural nurse, Reed will continue education and outreach with farmers. She'll assess needs in communities, then mobilize resources to address them. For example, a survey of 1500 farmers revealed that only one-third had a recent tetanus shot. Even fewer get regular flu shots. Reed can coordinate with local health departments or students at the UK College of Nursing to facilitate immunization clinics at local events such as the dinner theaters or field days.
The research portion of the dinner theaters has concluded. The events are now locally owned; any group can access an online toolkit to stage their own productions. Reed has found that communities adapt the shows to address their particular issues, such as financial issues, caregiving and women's health. The officers in the agricultural extension offices can promote resources based on the issues addressed in the shows, as well as help spread the word to other farmers to attend or participate. Local advocates like Jack and Thelma Blair encourage everyone in their community and beyond to attend.
"With farmers, there are a lot of things you can prevent," said Thelma. "Issues that will affect you later in life. You need to build awareness for prevention."
For Reed, it's personal. She grew up on a farm, and her siblings maintain farms nearby.
"I'm a farm girl who grew up from fifteen miles from UK campus," said Reed. "I have four degrees from UK. I don't just bleed blue, I am blue. We're all about trying to serve the Commonwealth. We don't want our farmers to suffer. This is one way I give back to my own family and friends, and give back to the Commonwealth."

Story 30
In the tech world, headlines are more often than not generated by consumer-oriented startups. Companies creating disruptive products for businesses, however, often attract even greater interest from investors than their B2C brethren. One reason for this is that B2B tech companies’ customers are far more likely to actually pay them – and pay them a lot. The 20 enterprise technology companies below are tackling a wide variety of problems from workplace communication to backend data management. What they have in common is that they are all producing significant value for their B2B customers. Here are 20 technologies for businesses to try out in 2017:
Asana
As workplace collaboration software has proliferated, two breeds of programs have emerged. One kind is expensive and fully functioned. It is sold to managers and implemented from the top down. The other—a bottom-up model—is free. It is meant to be adopted by employees who then convince bosses to pay for a premium version. Asana, a San Francisco–based startup valued at $600 million last March, straddles the space in between these two models. Robust enough to handle the demands of big customers, including Uber and AirBnb, it nevertheless offers a “freemium” version that is easy for employees to adopt. Asana has ambitious goals for international growth and recently hired a CFO with experience leading an IPO, both of which are signs that the company could be eyeing a public stock offering.
Bench
One of the fastest growing enterprise markets is sole proprietorships—people who work for themselves in the “gig economy.” The most thankless part of the job for many of them is bookkeeping. In 2012, Bench’s co-founders sensed an opportunity: take number crunching out of the hands of independent contractors and small businesses in exchange for a monthly subscription fee. This has been a winning idea. After emerging from the Techstars accelerator in New York, the company (founded as 10Sheet) moved to Vancouver to set up shop. Last year, after growing to more than 200 employees, Bench secured $16 million in funding in a round led by Bain Capital Ventures. It will use the money, in part, to pay the human bookkeepers who manage client relationships and oversee Bench’s accounting algorithms.
Benchmark
A bootstrapped success story, Benchmark Email was founded by a husband and wife team in 2004. They were both business people in previous lives. Curt Keller, now CEO, ran a printing business. Denise Keller, COO, had been an executive at Accor. But neither had direct experience in tech. Nevertheless, they entered the email marketing business early and became a leading player without taking significant outside funding. Today their product features a slick WYSIWYG design interface and an easy-to-use metrics platform. They claim to have more than 500,000 users—between their paid and free services—and big, paid accounts with the likes of Audi, BBVA, and Century 21.
Confluent
Founded in 2014 by former LinkedIn developers, Confluent sells data streaming software based on an open source service called Kafka. The Confluent founders helped create Kafka in 2010. Now their Confluent platform uses it to monitor—and transmit information about—customers’ IT networks. Confluent can handle everything from data produced by Internet of Things–connected devices to online transaction logs to inventory updates. In all cases, Confluent can produce both backend data transmissions and user-facing messages. In the rapidly growing field of data platforms, Confluent has attracted serious interest. Within a year of launching, it had already raised more than $30 million of venture capital funding, which has kept the company going since.
ControlUp
Founded in Israel in 2012, ControlUp offers a SaaS-based IT management solution that leverages crowdsourced data to help IT departments avoid and quickly fix problems, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The platform offers real-time visibility across the entire IT stack. Perhaps most impressive is the platform’s ability to leverage wisdom of the crowd to create comparative benchmarks that help IT organizations identify and solve IT issues that are common across many data centers. With thousands of enterprise customers, revenue that has doubled year-over-year since 2013, and plans to increase its real time performance metrics capabilities this year, ControlUp is keeping busy. In fact, the company just raised $10 million to expand worldwide.
DataDog
DataDog got its name because it is intended to serve as the loyal pet that an IT professional can't live without. The DataDog platform monitors every application and server in a company’s network infrastructure. Unifying all of this information is essential for modern companies with rapidly proliferating cloud technologies. Although DataDog and its competitors, including New Relic, are unknown to most, they are some of the hottest companies in tech. The New York-based company began the year by closing an eye-popping $95 million funding round. It will use the cash for various purposes including hiring engineers to keep up with the rapidly increasing complexity of the enterprise cloud.
dLocal
dLocal helps Western companies expand into emerging markets throughout the world with their payment technology platform. With pay-ins, payouts and cash collections, dLocal does the work of collections, compliance, handling local regulators (including central banks) and processing a bevy of fragmented, local payment methods in one easy-to-use platform. The company, riding the wave of globalization, helps businesses sell in countries traditionally inaccessible. In doing so, they bring goods and services to over two billion consumers throughout the world who previously had limited access due to lack of digital payment options. dLocal grew 400 percent last year and reaches 18 markets global – including most of Latin America, China, India and Turkey.
Dynamic Signal
While most enterprise communications apps focus on collaboration, Dynamic Signal specializes in one-way messaging. It is designed for big companies that need to push information to a vast number of employees. Dynamic Signal’s customers include huge corporations including Procter & Gamble, IBM, and Capital One. “If you look at a company like Disney,” Dynamic Signal’s CEO, Russ Fradin, told TechCrunch, “it has 180,000 employees. The idea that the CEO would be on WhatsApp or something like that is absurd.” The value proposition of Dynamic Signal is that it can deliver top-down messages to mobile devices that would otherwise arrive via media that are less likely to be read, such as company magazines or mass emails. Dynamic Signal also offers a service that enables its customers’ employees to advertise for their employers by posting directly to their own social media accounts. Last December Dynamic Signal raised $25 million in a round led by Microsoft Ventures, bringing the company’s valuation to $150 million.
Glassbox
Glassbox has developed technology that records and replays visits to a website or app, enabling businesses to see exactly how customers and prospects navigate. Going further than analytics, the platform helps decision-makers understand the underlying root causes contributing to or to detracting from engagement and conversions. The technology works on the macro and micro levels: spitting out everything from aggregated big data to detailed information about a single user’s activity, which collectively paint a picture of how users are behaving with a site. The company claims that the insights derived from these data has increased conversions by as much as 280 percent, decreased customer support call average duration by 75 percent, and overall decreased time-to-insight from weeks to minutes.
Guru
Guru is like a digital box of index cards storing all of a company’s knowledge. Its software can run in the background of every employee’s computer and deliver cards with relevant information on an individual basis when needed. The cards are created and continually updated by experts within the company. For example, IT professionals will manage the cards on cybersecurity measures. Meanwhile, product managers will update cards related to new product features or versions. Guru is particularly useful for sales. When a sales rep is on a call, Guru can pull up the cards about about the prospective client and the product being sold. The result is a highly informed workforce that can think as one. The company uses a “freemium” pricing model, offering its product for free at first and scaling up the cost as usage increases.
JumpCrew
Founded last year in Nashville, JumpCrew offers a hybrid human-technology platform that allows small businesses to outsource social media marketing. It is a tempting pitch for SMB owners who don’t have enough knowledge to run social media themselves, yet don’t have enough budget to pay a traditional service agency. JumpCrew, on the other hand, brings to play a human service component combined with a variety of technology, data, automated processes and economies of scale that drive effective campaigns on reasonable budgets. JumpCrew scaled up at launch with a $3.3 million seed round that enabled it to open offices in its hometown of Nashville and New York. The challenge will be carving a niche in the middle zone of do-it-yourself social media platforms and social media agencies. But the founders aren’t sweating - lead gen and conversion are their specialties.
mParticle
Behind the scenes, an app might be tied to an analytics platform, an ad-serving program, a crash reporting tool, and a push notifications agent, among other services. Before mParticle, app developers had to embed special code for every third party program an app connected with. This made apps bloated and developers overwhelmed by updates. mParticle has largely solved this problem. Its platform collects data from apps and pushes it to any commonly used program. So now mobile developers only have to embed one thing, mParticle, in their apps. Since launching in New York in 2013, mParticle has landed some impressive customers—like AirBnb, Spotify, and Venmo—and collected a war chest of venture capital funding. Last October it closed a $17.5 million round led by Bain Capital Ventures.
Nextiva
One of the original “cord cutters”, Nextiva is a cloud communications company that has helped businesses replace landline phones with digital internet phone systems since its founding in 2006. The company, which is now pulling in $100 million in annual revenue, was the brainchild of Tomas Gorny, a Polish American who has founded and sold multiple high-value companies. He created Nextiva to pioneer new communication technologies and change how businesses communicate. Nextiva has grown to 150,000 customers, primarily with its VoIP offering, though the company says later this year it will release an entirely new business communications product that will enable comprehension of customer sentiment and employee performance.
Outreach
Outreach is a sales engagement platform that can manage an entire sales staff’s communications with prospective clients. The platform has a high degree of automation: it places calls to leads, manages follow up, and can generate mass emails. So it is a good fit for companies with high volume lead generation. Outreach also allows sales teams to manage workflow when multiple reps collaborate on a single account. Like its competitors, such as SalesLoft and ToutApp, Outreach fully integrates with Salesforce and other CRMs. Founded in 2013 and based in Seattle, Outreach started with a few million dollars of seed capital. Since then it has become a leader in its competitive market. Last year, venture capitalists placed a big bet on the startup when Trinity Ventures led a $17.5 million series B round, bringing total funding to $30 million.
Percolate
According to Percolate, the average Fortune 500 company uses 50 different marketing software programs. Percolate integrates all of them into a single platform so that marketing campaigns can be managed end-to-end from one place. Founded in 2011, the company now occupies an enviable market position. The ability to integrate marketing software is most valuable to the biggest companies, so Percolate has landed customers including Unilever, Cisco & Levi's. At the same time, the code required to make so many disparate programs play nicely together is exceedingly complex. So there is a high barrier to entry for any aspiring competitor. The venture capital market has responded by throwing money at Percolate, which has raised $75 million of equity funding to date.
Shopkeep
One of the top point-of-sale systems for small businesses, Shopkeep sells itself on simplicity. The whole system—which manages transactions, inventory, orders, and receipts—runs on an iPad, has low startup costs, and costs a flat monthly fee. It also includes a mobile app that can consolidate data from multiple locations. In a competitive market, Shopkeep’s positioning has been especially attractive to small retail outfits, such as coffee shops, clothing stores, and counter-service restaurants. The company claims to have more than 23,000 customers, a number that has driven intense interest from investors. Since its founding in 2008, Shopkeep has raised almost $100 million in funding, allowing it to open five offices and expand from its New York HQ into foreign markets.
Slack
The heavyweight of enterprise tech startups, Slack rocketed to a valuation of $3.8 billion within two years of its public release. The secret sauce was a simple, yet fully functioned messaging and document-sharing app offered for free. From the time of the product’s launch in early 2014, it spread through word of mouth and its installed user base grew exponentially. It is the classic case of a successful “bottom up” strategy, since employees adopted the free version and their bosses later upgraded to the paid service. Slack has competitors, including HipChat, but none have been able to replicate its adoption rates. To drive continued growth, Slack recently unveiled a version designed for big corporations, which should allow the company to pursue bigger contracts. Disclosure: Slack is an investor in Troops.
TINYpulse
High turnover rates among tech workers have made managers more sensitive than ever to employee morale. Yet morale is a devilishly hard thing to measure. TINYpulse offers a tool meant to provide bosses with live, actionable insights into how their employees feel. The app collects anonymous feedback from workers, tracks progress toward goals, serves as a platform for coaching, and aggregates all of the collected data to provide a view of the workplace’s psyche. An added benefit is that the app can replace annual performance reviews, a time consuming and often dreaded ritual. Employers and investors alike have taken to the idea. Founded in 2012, TINYpulse now counts Facebook, IBM, and Michelin among its customers. Venture capitalists have poured in $9.5 million in two rounds. Yet founder David Niu claims that business is so good that much of this money is still in the bank.
Tipalti
Tipalti is an accounts payable automation platform that helps businesses streamline their entire global payment operations. The company claims that customers are typically able to wipe out 80 percent of their workload related to managing AP operations, while strengthening AP financial and compliance controls, slashing error rates by two thirds, and improving supplier relationships. Something is working, as Tipalti has doubled business year-over-year since 2014 and processed nearly $3 billion in annual transactions to over 1.5 million suppliers all over the globe. With its mission of liberating finance departments from burdensome day-to-day AP operations, Tipalti in its seven-year lifespan has gained a loyal following of hundreds of customers including Amazon, GoPro, Nikon, Twitter, and Vimeo. After all, who wouldn’t want to be free of accounts payable headaches?
TripActions
TripActions has developed a travel management solution that saves businesses money while rewarding employees. Through machine learning, personalization, and a large inventory pulled from multiple providers, the TripActions travel booking platform enables employees to receive cash and gift benefits for saving their company money when booking hotels, flights and cars. TripActions claims that its app can reduce employee travel budgets by 30 percent. If employees book cheaper options, they get rewards, such as Amazon gift cards. The more they save for the company, the more they are rewarded. Several prominent customers, including SurveyMonkey and eHarmony, have adopted the service, which launched in 2015. Meanwhile, investors have made a big bet that TripActions has hit on a winning strategy. In January, venture capitalists funded the company to the tune of $14.6 million.

Photo: Attendees at Vermont League of Cities & Towns discuss small community economic development strategies.
When most communities pursue economic development, local leaders often think of creating a burst of economic opportunity from large employers that can quickly increase employment for residents while at the same time increasing revenue into the municipality’s coffers. However, this strategy often does not support a diverse entrepreneur ecosystem and can increase a municipality’s risk of “placing all your eggs in one basket.”
In Vermont, I saw a different approach. The Vermont League of Cities and Towns convened a Community and Economic Development Forum that challenged local elected officials and municipal staff to think differently about economic development. In a state where small communities abound — only eight of Vermont’s 255 municipalities have populations in excess of 10,000 – cities and towns are exploring new and innovative approaches to boost economic growth.
Local leaders were invited to consider economic gardening, which promotes sustainable and long-term economic growth through non-traditional initiatives – from cultivating community engagement from diverse stakeholders to creating spaces for ideation, and from leveraging small dollars to support economic development, to removing the weeds or barriers for local economic engines. Each of these steps is critical to the economic vitality of any community.
At the Community and Economic Development Forum, local leaders learned five overarching strategies to help small towns leverage their community’s strengths.
Build your civic infrastructure
Economic development can often be viewed just in terms of capital, buildings, theatres, and new jobs. All too often, we lose sight of the residents as the engine that create, promote, and engage economic development locally. The forum’s keynote speaker, Rebecca Sanborn Stone from Community Workshop LLC, encouraged local leaders to focus on developing a Civic Infrastructure. Civic Infrastructure is looking at what is already available in the community, how the community connects, and who you are as a community. Check out her presentation.
Leverage municipal resources to support and grow local businesses
In the town of Bethel, VT, the community worked with the municipality to create a pop-up within the renovated town hall called Bethel University. The community-led educational program, which attracts residents and people from across the state and region, organizes classes on a variety of topics and interests.
The town of Brighton, VT, is known for skiing during the winter, but has struggled to attract off-season tourists. So town leaders created 33 disparate festivals that occur throughout the year. One of the most popular events is the Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Weekend, which was created after Brighton discovered that its annual chicken dinners simply were not profitable. A small team of local leaders and volunteers was able to attract over 15,000 people to a town of only about 1,200, representing a 1,200 percent increase in their population.
Inspire local entrepreneurs to dream and implement
In the city of Detroit, MI, despite being a large city, the community launched Detroit Soup in the small neighborhoods to support local entrepreneurs. At Detroit Soup, attendees pay $5 and receive soup, salad, bread, and a vote to decide on the best business idea pitched at the event. Think Shark Tank for the community. The winner receives the evening’s proceeds to launch their idea.
Use placemaking demonstrations to implement permanent ideas
Through AARP’s national work around placemaking – or the planning, design, and management of public spaces –AARP Vermont has led the way for promoting placemaking opportunities for a variety of communities in the state. Every year, AARP offers $3,000 through its Placemaking Demonstration Project. The friendly competition encourages municipalities and organizations to “employ temporary changes for the goal of leading to permanent change that support healthy active lifestyles for people of all ages and abilities.” Check with your state AARP to see if they offer this grant.
As a title sponsor of NLC’s City Summit this year, AARP will present creative ideas on building age-friendly and thriving communities.
Get out of the way of community ideas
Finally, local leaders are urged to challenge the status quo. Throughout the Community and Economic Development Forum, a thread of reducing policies and regulations that stifle a community’s efforts to dream and implement new and sometimes crazy ideas was common. It is easy for municipal officials to be adverse to change, fearing its impact on the community and future elections. However, being overly cautious can impede your community’s ability to develop and grow economically. Removing barriers to community ideas sometimes take the form of changing policies, ordinances, or even challenging the thinking of municipal staff and officials that “this is the way it has always been done.”
VLCT Executive Maura Carroll said, “It’s wonderful to see local officials be so enthusiastic over the available resources and tools that allow them to work on economic development throughout all of Vermont’s towns and cities.” To learn more strategies and insights to support small municipalities, click here.

CLOSE Indiana residents have made their mark on shows ranging from "Survivor" and "The Voice" to "RuPaul's Drag Race" and "MasterChef." David Lindquist/IndyStar, David Lindquist/IndyStar
Indianapolis resident Johnny Magic will put his stage name to the test on an episode of "Penn & Teller: Fool Us" airing tonight on the CW network.
Magic, a 2007 graduate of Anderson University, will attempt a trick with hopes of outwitting famed performers and magic historians Penn Jillette and the singularly named Teller.
Tonight's episode is titled "Magical Moxie," a reference to bold deceptions in store from Johnny Magic and three other competitors. If Magic stumps the "Fool Us" stars, the Southern Indiana native will be invited to appear as part of Penn & Teller's residency at the Rio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.

Magic said he's relying on a volunteer audience member selected by a "Fool Us" producer.
"When I pitched my trick idea, they immediately expressed their concern and hesitation," Magic said of the series hosted by "How I Met Your Mother" actress Alyson Hannigan. "Who could blame them? It was a big gamble to invite me. My trick didn’t rely on sleight of hand or fancy props. Everything depended on my interactions with a random volunteer, and there was no room for error. 'This could completely fail,' they said. 'That’s true,' I admitted, 'Or it could one of the most impressive mentalism feats ever attempted on television.' I had their attention."
The episode will air at 8 p.m. locally on WISH-TV. A rebroadcast is scheduled 8 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 1.
Magic, who grew up near Batesville, describes himself as an improv magician.
"The audience and volunteers influence what happens, creating unpredictable twists and fun surprises," he said in an email interview. "There is amazing power in being present in the moment, and magic reminds us to see beyond our limiting beliefs. I want to inspire others to wonder, discover and play."
At the same time, audience members are unpredictable. Magic said his volunteer on "Fool Us" expressed a sense of nervousness and even fear.
"Involving a random person in my first national TV appearance was definitely a huge risk," he said. "Adding to the tension was that instead of doing a trick I had been perfecting for years, I created a new trick for the show that I had never performed.

After graduating from Anderson, Magic moved to Indianapolis to work in video for a media company. He became a full-time magician in 2016.
"My performance career started as a kid in our basement, where I charged a quarter for neighbors to see a 10-minute show," Magic said. "Soon I was performing magic for birthday parties, talent shows, and family events at various churches."
Magic said he grew up in an artistic family.
"My dad, Larry, enjoyed building theater sets and producing plays," Magic said. "We spent every summer performing musicals and talent shows in the local high school auditorium. A self-employed interior painter by day, on weekends my dad would also dress up as a clown or other characters when he MC’d local events. In hindsight, I was certainly being groomed to be an entertainer."

The RSA is reminding road users to be careful on roads, and asking people to check local weather and traffic conditions and be aware of the conditions before setting out on a trip.
The RSA has the following advice for road users:
Beware of objects being blown out onto the road. Expect the unexpected.
Watch out for falling/fallen debris on the road and vehicles veering across the road.
Control of a vehicle may be affected by strong crosswinds. High sided vehicles and motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable to strong winds.
Drivers should allow extra space allow between themselves and vulnerable road users such as cyclists and motorcyclists as they may be blown off course by strong winds.
Drive with dipped headlights at all times.
It’s also advising pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists:
Be seen. Wear bright clothing with reflective armbands or a reflective belt.
Take extra care when crossing the road or cycling in extremely windy conditions as a sudden gust of wind could blow you into the path of an oncoming vehicle.
Walk on a footpath, not in the street. Walk on the right hand side of the road, facing traffic if there are no footpaths.

En el año que acaba de comenzar, las personas tendrán que estar preparadas para esconder el teléfono y sumergirse en unas horas o días libres de tecnología o, dicho en otras palabras, para vivir su primer detox digital.
En la publicación se habla de autos eléctricos, de directores de aprendizaje, de bitcoins, de inteligencia artificial; también de muchos otros conceptos cuya aplicación en Uruguay parece estar aún lejana. Para que una tendencia global se considere también para Uruguay necesita de una fuerza suficiente que la empuje hacia esa dirección.
Fue por eso que Café & Negocios seleccionó 10 tendencias globales –provenientes del artículo de Linkedin y otras que se repitieron en conferencias y conversaciones del mundo empresarial local durante el pasado año– e invitó a ejecutivos, empresarios y emprendedores a elegir aquellas que, según su percepción, llegaron para quedarse y consolidarse durante este nuevo año.
Para el CEO de la agencia de innovación The Electric Factory, Andrés Guarino, durante 2018 se verá mayor crecimiento de aquellas empresas nacidas en Uruguay, pero con una concepción global de su negocio.
Guarino define esta tendencia como "Del Uruguay exportador al Uruguay global: "Hasta aquí siempre hubo un adentro y un afuera en donde la exportación era la herramienta para ampliar el mercado. Durante 2018 veremos crecer más empresas que modelan su estrategia sin la restricción geográfica como una limitante auto impuesta", opinó. Otra tendencia, según Guarino, es el procesamiento de feedback. Según el ejecutivo, durante 2018 se deberían ver más compañías que se basen y aprendan constantemente de sus interacciones con usuarios.
El presidente de Young & Rubicam, Álvaro Moré, dijo que prefiere llamar a estas dos compañías como "plataformas digitales de negocios" más que colaborativas, por ser intermediarios que cobran altas comisiones. Indicó que la economía colaborativa como tal, seguirá avanzando "por una razón muy sencilla: tiene sentido".
Para Moré, seguirán apareciendo plataformas colaborativas donde los pares generen acuerdos con baja o nula intermediación.
Por otra parte, el decano de la escuela de negocios IEEM, Pablo Regent, dijo que los negocios con el papel de intermediar irán perdiendo espacio.
La inteligencia artificial fue la tendencia más destacada por los ejecutivos consultados.
Para la coordinadora de emprendimientos de ANDE, Amalia Quirici, el IOT se intensificará este año en Uruguay con "más integración, más soluciones, más servicios que integren tecnología para una mayor y mejor calidad de vida de las personas y productividad de las empresas".
La arquitecta Gabriela Pallares señaló que convivirán proyectos de gestión urbana gubernamental con aplicaciones particulares, y que se generarán "universos unidos en Internet de las Cosas" para mejorar gestiones públicas o privadas en salud, movilidad, tiempo libre, tránsito, educación, seguridad, entre otras cosas. En tanto, el director ejecutivo de la consultora EY, Ernesto Scayola, opinó que si bien no cree que 2018 sea el año de la explosión de Internet de las Cosas, la tecnología debería seguir avanzando y mostrando cada vez mayores aplicaciones. "En el campo empresarial las aplicaciones en sectores industriales, transporte y logística continuarán creciendo generando cadenas de valor más eficientes", dijo.
Para el VP de productos de dLocal, Rodrigo Sánchez, las experiencias en retail se consolidarán como tendencia. Esto, dijo, se debe a que los millennials buscan cada vez más experiencias en lugar de productos para hacer sus gastos. "Esto hace que apostar a experiencias sea más atractivo para los comercios", indicó. Cree que un indicio de esta tendencia en Uruguay son los foodtrucks, "donde solamente la buena comida no es suficiente".
Inteligencia artificial
La directora de Yellow, Virginia Gómez, opinó que los influencers pierden credibilidad desde el momento en que se conoce cuál es su verdadero rol. "La gente necesita creer, una recomendación de verdad, una experiencia sincera, desinteresada", dijo. En ese sentido, el CMO de Woow, Claudio Lombardo, dijo que las marcas tenderán a volver a usar referentes orgánicos propios.
Bitcoin y blockchain
Naor de Bankingly subrayó que será más fácil comprar y vender bitcoins y que startups locales intentarán utilizarlas para solucionar problemas de inclusión financiera o movimiento de dinero.
Detox digital

Para Álvaro García, de PedidosYa, el detox digital "se viene cada vez más", al igual que el mindfulness o la alimentación sana. En las reuniones, dijo que se deja el celular en una bandeja para enfocarse durante una o dos horas sin distracciones. El CEO de Woow, Leonardo Silveira, opinó que tanto a nivel de empresas como de familia y amigos, las personas deberían obligarse a no usar el celular en exceso, y que en reuniones "la calidad de las charlas y del intercambio mejora exponencialmente cuando no hay celulares activos" En las reuniones de Woow, dijo que, aunque muchas veces es dificl de cumplir, tienen la regla de no usar celular: "El resultado no es 100%, pero al menos hemos logrado una cultura en la cual usarlo en reuniones no está bien visto".

- Nigerian media personality and model, Denrele Edun has taken to social media to share some of the challenges he faced in the fashion industry
- According to his post, his breakthrough in the industry didn't come easy as he didn't possess the physical qualities of a model most designers wanted to work with
- He spoke about one of such experiences he had with a designer as he shared a throwback photo
Many Nigerians across the country are familiar with the effervescent cross-dresser identified as Denrele Edun. His big hair, made up face and ginormous heels are not lost on people.
However, not so many are familiar with the challenges he faced on his way towards becoming one of Nigeria's most influential personalities. In a recent post on Instagram in which he shared a throwback photo of himself, he opened up about the trials he faced when he started pursuing a modeling career.
He wrote: "1999. Shola Creative Studios, SuruLere. An (Androgynous) Male Model has to be psychologically strong; there's a lot of rejection! In the spirit of FashionWeek, allow me dig out my dusty portfolios and throwback my first ever professional modeling shot!

I had developed a knack for appearing at Fashion Designer showrooms and their houses to present my pictures & my overwhelming personality. All in a bid to convince them to walk in their shows.
Mind you; I was the shortest, skinniest Male Model at that time, but that didn't deter me. The Hustle was real! I got to a designer's house and saw a cluster of top models. They all burst into laughter when I walked past but then, who cared? Sighting a familiar face, I ran up to her and was told fittings had begun. In my usual bravado, i saw the designer & walked up to him.

Moment i introduced myself & my intentions, he stared me down and asked, "Are you a Refugee?". "No Sir, but I'm the model with a unique look who'll love to walk for u," I threw back confidently. He looked me up and down and said, "U can never walk on my runway. U look like a malnourished Somalian refugee", and with that he faced his tailors & continued giving directives. "I'll wait in d Showroom Sir, till u'r ready to fit me", I answered bk & walked in to the reception.
This designer actually hissed & went in. Came out, dismissed all d other models without me noticing and left the building. Wit all d bravado I could muster, I waited for an agonizing 12 hours. I was scared to go get something to eat cos i didn't want to miss his entrance. At bout 11pm, he strolled in wit some other models. They obviously had finished a shoot & he seemed to be in a light mood. Seein my chance, I walked up to him.
This time, he lost his cool.But that didnt stop me from walking his show weeks after.He refused to pay me & not only was I stranded but had to walk from V/I to Yaba wher Vigilantes made me frog jump on the express! The Designer? We're friends till date! Why? Denrele get clean mind!"

GROSSE POINTE SHORES, Mich. (WXYZ) — If you walk into a restaurant or business in Grosse Pointe Shores, chances are they’re talking about the water rescue that happened early Thursday morning .
Police cars and firetrucks lined Lake Shore Drive during the Thursday morning commute, the remnants of a rescue mission performed by Officer Tony Spina. Spina, who is a certified dive master, was the first officer to respond to a 9-1-1 call — a car had been driven into Lake Saint Clair and was sinking.
“It’s the kind of rescue that makes you proud,” said Chief John Schulte, who was standing alongside the shoulder of Lake Shore Road near Lochmoor Boulevard where the car crashed into the water.
It’s still not known what caused the driver to crash into the water. He never spoke with 9-1-1 operators directly, in fact, it was an OnStar operators that radio’d local emergency responders letting them know that the car was sinking into the lake, and that they had just lost contact with the driver.
“Obviously it’s dark out,” said Officer Spina, recalling the rescue. “There’s no street lights illuminating the lake but I could see taillights out 20-30 yards in the water.”
He called out for the person and ran up and down the shoreline with a flashlight — he heard a voice, but it was faint. That’s when he made a last request before jumping in, he yelled out, “I need a medic.”
According to Spina, he held onto a portion of the iron that is sticking out of the concrete seawall — the man was struggling to get to shore, but he came close enough that Spina was able to grab him and pull him in front of the officer as he essentially bear hugged the man into the wall.
“I just kept telling him, ‘I’ve got you, I’ve got you.’”
The man continued to thrash, but that’s when a giant wave carried the two men out of the water and on top of the seawall — Spina said the man was so scared he continued to kick, but he eventually calmed him down. Both men freezing cold and wet, waited as medics rushed to their aide.
“I may have been in the water, but it was a collective effort,” said Spina, a veteran diver who had trained for something like this but admitted he’d never experienced a rescue like this one.
There was no wet suit, no rope, no safety restraints — Spina said that in a perfect world there would have been time to retrieve the types of things you train for in a swift water rescue, but in this case he chocked it up to luck.
Asked how he enjoyed a warm shower after he finally warmed up, he laughed.
“It was nice, a hot shower felt pretty good.”
“He is a trained diver, but he was not prepared for that at the time,” said Chief Schulte. “He is a top-notch officer and he ended up in the water without even thinking about it, he did what he had to do.”

This article was exclusively written for The European Sting by Ms. Bárbara Okabaiasse Luizeti, a 20 year old third year medical student from Brazil. She is affiliated to the International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA), cordial partner of The Sting. The opinions expressed in this piece belong strictly to the writer and do not necessarily reflect IFMSA’s view on the topic, nor The European Sting’s one.
In the field of medicine, the sixteenth century was consecrated with the birth of human anatomy, the seventeenth century called the cradle of physiology, the nineteenth of scientific bases, from advances in chemistry, physics and biology; and the twentieth century was considered the century of innovation, with the inauguration of biotechnology and the discovery of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.
Nowadays, in the 21st century, the so-called “techno-scientific revolution”. The breadth of the new knowledge of genomics, immunology and nanotechnology, coupled with innovation in the field of fine chemistry, determine the appearance of new vaccines, drugs, surgical techniques, assisted reproduction and gene therapy.
Through all these scientific-technological advances, there are three great human utopias: the eternity/longevity, the beauty and pleasure (by the appearance of new drugs that suppress the pain and promote physical and psychic pleasure). Medicine is daily on the frontier of moral responsibilities, determined by the process of increasingly aggressive intervention of man in the biosphere, accelerating its deterioration, and intervention in the very essence of the human being.
In addition, during the history of Medicine, there have always been ethical dilemmas, such as the confidentiality and privacy of medical information. However, with the evolution of this science, technological innovations in medical care practice constantly generate new ethical impasses. It is worth emphasizing that in the health sector, innovation should aim to improve the quality of life of people, through the use of products and procedures to prevent diseases or eradicate them.
Therefore, the techniques that impose moral and ethical dilemmas must be analyzed by researchers, physicians and medical students in the areas of safety, efficiency, social repercussion and improvement in relation to traditional treatment, that is, to promote a better effect in the process of health and illness of the patient, corresponding to the principle of beneficence. Awareness of an ethics of responsibility must be developed, both at the individual level and at institutional and government levels, exemplified through legal, bureaucratic and protocol regulations.
Modern technologies will only be fully justified if they are conditioned to an effective improvement in the quality of life and health of the human being, and not to represent a form of domination and usurpation of the medical culture by the machine, or by subjecting the patient to the ideology of scientism or market logic.
It is necessary to critically review the goals and values ​​that govern the medical profession, in addition, it is necessary to abolish the ideology of healing illness or maintaining the patient’s life, at any cost, even after all the biological possibilities for maintenance have been exhausted quality of life.
In this regard, Palliative Medicine proposes to reflect on measures related to euthanasia and dysthanasia, as well as to orthothanasia, that is, the humanized medical practice, which allows the natural death, dignified, and without suffering to the patient. There must be a balance between the technical-scientific side and the human values ​​and virtues inherent in the medical profession.

70,000 premises passed mark passed by CityFibre for Vodafone Gigafast roll-out
The Vodafone Gigafast footprint built by CityFibre continues to grow. The footprint in Milton Keynes, Peterborough, Aberdeen, Coventry and Stirling has now reached 70,748 premises and we expect any day to start finding premises in Huddersfield that can also order the service.
This is an increase of 7,000 premises in just over three weeks and while it is unlikely that the build rate will change for individual teams what should happen as places like Huddersfield and other Gigabit Cities start showing up is that the number of teams building will increase and thus the overall rate will rise.
The transformation that full fibre should bring to areas, particularly those that don't have an ultrafast broadband option already should start to become apparent soon as the five local authority areas where the Gigafast network is present have overall full fibre availability as follows:
Milton Keynes 42.6%
Peterborough 23%
Coventry 20.5%
Stirling 12.3%
Aberdeen 8.2%
Remember these figures cover all full fibre operators but the Gigafast service is the largest slice of the cake in each of those five locations. Milton Keynes holds the title of the 3rd most full fibre'd local authority in the UK beaten only by York 49.7% and Hull 98.5%.
Update 13th August 2019 The fibre roll-outs mean figures don't stay static for long and Milton Keynes has been pushed down into fourth place by Salford, with Salford now at 43.7% full fibre coverage versus the 42.6% of Milton Keynes. The change is due to the Openreach Fibre First roll-out on the Walkden exchange.

NEW DELHI: As BJP embarks on an awareness drive across the country, including in Jammu and Kashmir, on the justification for abrogation of Article 370 and the accruing benefits, a parallel educational campaign on the same lines has been launched among Kashmiri people with involvement of the local administration and local self-governments.Source said the local awareness drive will focus on areas like terror-hit south Kashmir where information regarding abrogation of Article 370 has been slow to percolate due to lack of access to newspapers and the communication/internet shutdown."Many local Kashmiris here are not really aware of what the abrogation of Article 370 really means and how they stand to be impacted. So, the local administration and panchayats have been roped in to carry the message to the people on the reasoning behind ending special status for J&K and how this stands to benefit them in terms of access to central schemes and benefits and boosting employment and tourism potential of the state," an officer said.The officer said the educational campaign, launched last week, is being undertaken at various levels - district/tehsil officers and staff, forces' interface with communities, revenue officers and local panchayats. "The purpose is to remove any misconceptions regarding how abrogation of Article 370 would impact Kashmiris and the justification behind reorganisation of J&K. This will prevent local Kashmiris from being misled by any misinformation or politically-motivated versions being put out or likely to be propagated by Pakistani agencies, terror outfits and even local politicians once they are released," the officer said.Amid the awareness drive, teams of various Union ministries and departments are visiting J&K by turn to plan initiatives for the state under existing central schemes. While the local administration claims normalcy is returning to the Valley as curbs are lifted in a phased manner, many markets and shops in Srinagar are voluntarily being kept shut by locals as they fear a backlash from terrorists.

A property owner who has been unable to sell a flat for two years has taken to social media in desperation.
Nicole Bremner is offering a “large personal cheque” to anyone that sells it plus the usual commissions.
She is also dangling the prospect of “about another 100 flats” for sale.
Bremner, who describes herself as an author, speaker, investor, developer and mother, said she has had the property, in South Kensington, London, with three different agents.
She is calling it her £5m problem.
She said: “We did get a cheeky offer in February [but we] said no. Went back with a ‘yes’ and it was retracted.”
She says it has been presented with different sorts of furniture and re-styled three times. And she definitely does not think the price is the problem.
It was first marketed at £5.25m but is now on at £4.25m.
However, those who have responded on Twitter insist that the price is the problem.
It seems buying agent Henry Pryor thought it was worth £3m back in February 2018 when it was on with Knight Frank.
One poster suggests she invites the ten best local estate agents over, and lock them in.
Curiously, the property has other investors as a result of some crowdfunding about three years ago. In a video, Bremner admits that some are losing patience as they’d expected their money back.
Now on with Rickman Properties, it’s described as immaculate.
EYE wondered if for that price we’d want a bigger kitchen, the option of a lift and some garden rather than a small empty terrace.
And maybe more than three bedrooms?
However, we’re not estate agents.
So, over to you . . .
How would YOU sell this property?

Pode ser a melhora para a morte ou para uma classificaÃ§Ã£o inÃ©dita. Fato Ã© que o empate em 3×3 da Argentina com a EscÃ³cia na tarde desta quarta-feira (19) fez com que as Hermanas chegasse a dois pontos no Grupo D e passasse justamente as adversÃ¡rias, com apenas um. Na 3Âª colocaÃ§Ã£o, a Albiceleste precisa ainda que nenhuma das seleÃ§Ãµes que buscam vaga nesta quinta-feira (20) venÃ§a. Ou seja, Ã© preciso que CamarÃµes x Nova ZelÃ¢ndia e TailÃ¢ndia x Chile acabem empatados.
Para as escocesas, a lamentaÃ§Ã£o. Elas chegaram a abrir trÃªs gols de vantagem e sofreram o empate nos Ãºltimos vinte minutos de jogo, dos 29 do segundo tempo aos 49, jÃ¡ nos acrÃ©scimos.

O JOGO
O primeiro tempo teve apenas um gol. Aos 19 minutos, ErinÂ Cuthbert passou da defesa argentina e chutou firme. A goleira Correa defendeu inicialmente, a escocesa recuperou a posse e entregou para Kim Little, em frente ao gol livre, marcar. O segundo gol sÃ³ chegou no segundo tempo, aos 4 minutos, com Beattie. Vinte minutos depois,Â Cuthbert ampliou.
Mas a reaÃ§Ã£o das Hermanas chegou. Primeiro, aos 29. Menendez, que entrou nesta etapa, trabalhou comÂ Ippolito e fez o primeiro gol da Argentina na Copa. Cinco minutos depois comeÃ§ou o drama da goleira escocesa Lee Alexander. Aos 34, ela colocou o chute de Bonsegundo para dentro da rede.
O empate, porÃ©m, nÃ£o chegou de maneira calma. Faltando dois minutos para o fim do tempo regulamentar, um pÃªnalti para as sul-americanas foi analisado pelo Ã¡rbitro de vÃ­deo e confirmado pela Ã¡rbitra coreana. Bonsegundo foi para a cobranÃ§a e Alexander defendeu. A arqueira, contudo, se adiantou e a cobranÃ§a voltou. Dessa vez, Bonsegundo aproveitou os Ãºltimos instantes de jogo para dar o respiro Ã seleÃ§Ã£o alviceleste.

California housing reform took a big step forward yesterday when a state Senate committee voted to advance a controversial upzoning bill that would allow the construction of four- and five-story apartment buildings in areas where only single-family housing is currently allowed.
In a 6-1 bipartisan vote, the California Senate's Government and Finance committee approved SB 50. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Scott Wiener (D–San Francisco), would upzone residential land near frequently serviced transit stops and job centers.
Zoning for more, denser housing, the bill's proponents say, will spur new housing construction, and help arrest the state's ever-climbing rents and home prices.
The bill "will help relieve California's acute housing shortage…make housing more affordable, increase the supply of low-income housing, and reduce pressure to create more sprawl and build in wildfire zones," reads a press release issued by Wiener's office shortly after the vote.
Getting committee approval for the bill is a marginal step, but a significant one nonetheless. A very similar upzoning measure introduced last year by Wiener was killed in its first committee hearing.
Yesterday saw SB 50 survive, but only after a number of substantial amendments.
The bill will now allow fourplexes to be built throughout the state on vacant residential land by-right (meaning no discretionary government approval is required). This will pave the way for the construction of a lot more "missing middle" housing.
Aside from this fourplex provision, most of yesterday's changes will limit the scope of SB 50. One amendment exempts coastal cities of less than 50,000 people from most of the bill's upzoning provisions. Historical districts also got their own carveout, as did counties with fewer than 600,000 residents.
The definition of what counts as a high-frequency transit stop was also pared back.
All these amendments add complexity to an already complicated bill. Wednesday's committee carveouts also come in addition to onerous demolition controls and affordable housing mandates already included in SB 50.
Wednesday's changes are politically expedient, and probably necessary to ensure the bill's continued progress through the legislature. With the exception of the fourplex amendment, however, they all water down the impact Weiner's legislation can be expected to have on housing affordability.
As Steven Greenhut pointed out in a recent Reason column, SB 50 also does nothing to allow new housing on rural- and agricultural-zoned land at the fringes of California's cities. That's by design, as a major purpose of Weiner's bill is to encourage more transit ridership and combat sprawl.
The result, however, is that a big opportunity to allow for the construction of cheaper suburban housing was missed.
By hacking away at some of California's restrictive local zoning codes, SB 50 would be a net benefit to both the state and its hard-pressed renters. Nevertheless, as more and more carve-outs and exemptions are added, the bill starts to look less like a bold reform, and more like only a marginal improvement on the dreadful status quo.

With a free long weekend in Paris, an itch to get out of the city and entering my third month of separation anxiety from my motorcycle in Israel, I rented a bike and traveled north to one of my favorite destinations in France, the Normandy region.
Thanks to history, they still love Americans in this part of France. The Normandy region, only a few hours from Paris, was where the Allies landed for D-Day on June 6, 1944, and there is an abundance of interesting history sprinkled throughout the area. Excellent museums, a multitude of video presentations, well-documented memorials, great beaches, delicious French food, friendly locals, affordable accommodations and winding country roads make this an absolutely perfect destination for motorcycle riders. Bikers from the United Kingdom take their motorcycles on the numerous ferries that cross the English Channel to ride in France and throughout Europe, often booking a year in advance to ensure a spot on the ferry.

After visiting the rental shop in Paris a few weeks earlier and checking out the motorcycles, I chose a 2018 BMW G310GS which I christened Nellie, like a horse, since it was a bit of a chore to get my leg over the seat. But once on it, the BMW sank to the ground and provided the perfect saddle. After picking it up on a Friday afternoon and receiving a briefing on the bike, I made it – teeth clenched during rush hour – out of Porte Maillot to the A-14 highway and through the long, barely lit tunnels that transport you from the city under the La Defense suburbs and then spit you out on the A-13 all the way to Normandy.
As I wanted to get to my destination before dark, I took the autoroute, but the abundance of rest areas and nice scenery along the way made traveling on the highway a pleasant experience. Figuring out how to efficiently navigate through the many gare de peages (toll booths) was initially a bit of a challenge until I realized that I needed to use the dedicated motorcycle lane, pay by credit card (as fumbling for cash and change is too time-consuming), and not panic while removing my gloves and putting them back on, as the gate stays open until passing through. This is easy in a car but a bit more complicated while on a motorcycle.As I wanted to get to my destination before dark, I took the autoroute, but the abundance of rest areas and nice scenery along the way made traveling on the highway a pleasant experience.

This is easy in a car but a bit more complicated while on a motorcycle.A few notes to those who have never traveled by motorcycle or don’t ride: Motorcycle travel is a very different experience than car – or as bikers like to say, “cage” – travel. On a bike, one is totally exposed to the elements, feeling the wind, weather and smells. One connects with nature and the road in a way that cannot be experienced in a cage. One feels the change in temperature as you climb up or down. Road conditions can become downright hazardous in construction zones and sudden downpours making the ride uncomfortable. However, when all conditions are perfect, there is no better way to travel! Thankfully, I had a trifecta – perfect weather, no traffic and no breakdowns.Bikers are a friendly lot, especially in France, and kick their right foot out when passing as a way of saying hello. They wave or give the peace sign from the other side of the road as they pass and you are expected to do the same. At rest stops and restaurants it’s not uncommon to strike up a conversation with a fellow biker about their travels or their motorcycle and share a table, something rarely done by those traveling in a cage. To most bikers, their motorcycle is a source of pride and joy and most riders are happy to talk about their bike, especially if you throw them a few compliments. In France, motorcycles are allowed to “lane split” – ride between cars – which is a great time-saver in traffic, particularly in the heat, and one of the supreme advantages to riding in Europe. Helmet use is mandatory, gloves are required and most riders bring their own gear.

We took the peripherique highway around Caen and followed signs for Arromanches-les-Bains, a delightful small village on the coast of Normandy. Like most, I’m used to traveling by using Waze or Google Maps and blindly follow their directions. But here, with no way to mount my phone on the motorcycle and no communication system in my helmet, I had to navigate the old-fashioned way – by using my intuition and destination road signs. I rarely took out my phone and instead planned my trip by looking at maps and a small atlas I had bought in Paris. I stuffed a few maps in my jacket to ensure I could make it from Paris to Arromanches and realized that it’s actually quite liberating to travel “sans GPS.”AFTER A few hours, Nellie and I were well acquainted and enjoying each other’s company.

I stuffed a few maps in my jacket to ensure I could make it from Paris to Arromanches and realized that it’s actually quite liberating to travel “sans GPS.”Soon after exiting the highway, I was on beautiful twisty country D (local) roads riding through French villages, each one quainter than the last – this is why I came here! Signs of World War II began to appear everywhere. It’s difficult to believe now, but most of these villages were totally destroyed during the war and rebuilt. Many children and adults waved as I passed by, as motorcyclists are well-liked in this part of France. On the way, I stopped in Crépon, another charming village, to view a monument to the sixth and seventh battalions of the Green Howards – the British regiment that liberated the town on D-Day. Monuments to the liberating soldiers are found in most villages, especially those closer to the coast.As it was starting to get late, I wanted to get to my destination before nightfall and as much as I wanted to linger, it was time to move on. Using Tripadvisor, I found the perfect bed and breakfast that caters to motorcycle riders. Normandy Beach B&B is run by Adrian and Karen Cox, expats that left the UK many years ago and opened their place in Arromanches-les-Bains. With only a small sign announcing their B&B, I passed by their location several times before I noticed Adrian standing outside waving me in. He had heard the sound of the BMW and had thought it was me!Amenities included a fridge with unlimited free beer, wine and soft drinks; a common table for breakfast; and a pleasant outdoor picnic area encouraging visitors and riders to socialize and share travel information. For motorcycle repairs, they even have a tool shed and contacts at the motorcycle dealers when things go wrong – a common occurrence on long biker trips! Adrian and Karen, the perfect hosts, provided useful advice when I was planning my day trips, and I wisely altered my planned itineraries as their recommendations were spot-on.Arromanches, on Gold Beach, was the site of Mulberry B, an artificial harbor built by the Allies to unload equipment, cargo and supplies for the D-Day invasion. This village makes the perfect base for traveling in this region – east, west, or south – due to its central location from the D-Day landing beaches, tourist sites and small villages. After a delicious dinner in town of the freshest mussels I ever had in France, I was exhausted and ready for bed. The next morning, I met with the other guests – several non-motorcycle tourists from Denmark traveling by rental car, and a friendly couple traveling on two splendid Triumph Street Triples who took the ferry from the UK to Cherbourg, a French port a few hours away. After a tasty breakfast, it was time to get back on Nellie and explore.Arromanches, on Gold Beach, was the site of Mulberry B, an artificial harbor built by the Allies to unload equipment, cargo and supplies for the D-Day invasion.

After a tasty breakfast, it was time to get back on Nellie and explore.THE WEATHER WAS “parfait” – blue skies, high 70s, no rain in the forecast. Ideal for motorcycling! My plan was to ride along the coast to check out the D-Day Gold and Juno landing beaches and then turn inland, riding south to an area called La Suisse Normande via the Swiss Normandy Route.I donned my gear and pulled out of the B&B, heading east on D-514 that follows the coast. The ride is idyllic! D-514 is a lovely coastal road offering inviting seaside villages, farms, sea views and ports along the way. There was no shortage of places to stop on this route. I made a spontaneous decision to stop at Graye-sur-Mer, one of several towns on the sea with several memorials and monuments that was liberated by the Canadians and other allied forces.This is prime D-Day territory, where D-Day started, and was code named Operation Overlord. The beaches called Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword are forever burned in history. The One Charlie tank, belonging to the 26th Armored Engineer Squadron, the seventh Canadian Infantry, is permanently on display with a plaque that states:This tank landed on Graye-sur-Mer beach at H-Hour on D-Day and was stopped on its way inland, 100 meters south of this spot. The members of its crew were killed or badly wounded. It remains as a memorial to all those who gave their lives here on June 6, 1944.Even more touching is another plaque next to the tank with the following inscription:In accordance with his best wishes, the ashes of Bill Dunn, tank driver of One Charlie, were scattered here on November 8, 2014.There is even a monument to the 16,000 Polish soldiers and 400 tanks that belonged to the First Armored Division of Poland under the direction of Gen. Stanistaw Maczek, which landed here at the end of July 1944. On the beach is a large Cross of Lorraine, the French symbol that stood for “Free France” during World War II as well as its liberation.This tank landed on Graye-sur-Mer beach at H-Hour on D-Day and was stopped on its way inland, 100 meters south of this spot.

On the beach is a large Cross of Lorraine, the French symbol that stood for “Free France” during World War II as well as its liberation.I continued down the coast, veered inland via the D-60 to Caen and then around the peripherique, taking the exit for La Suisse Normande following the signs to Thury-Harcourt, the start of the 65-kilometer and not widely advertised Swiss Normandy Route. After traveling at 50 km. per hour for most of the coastal road, it was a relief to pull Nellie back up to 90-100 KPH on the way south. With few gas stations and mostly small villages, I made sure that I filled up before starting this route. The La Suisse Normande is a serpentine road that is better suited for motorcyclists and bicyclists than four-wheel vehicles. While it is a two-lane route, much of it is wide enough for just one vehicle and meanders through farmland, small villages, across streams and by cute B&Bs. If I had been in a car, I would probably have been nauseous due to the constant curves, but on a bike – it was perfect.The scenery is reminiscent of Switzerland, hence the name of the route, and every turn provides spectacular scenery. Many of the stone country houses appeared as if they had been unoccupied for many years. I had to pay close attention to the signs, as the road constantly splits again and again, and it would be easy to lose your bearings. I encountered few other bikers, attesting to the “secret” of this route. For lunch, I stopped in Pont-d’Ouilly, a gorgeous town on the banks of a river with ideal, Instagram-worthy picnic areas and a starting point for kayak trips. Never did a camembert, butter and cucumber baguette sandwich picked up at the local deli taste so good!AFTER LUNCH, I continued on to Clécy, one of the jewels of the area. This is the quintessential French tourist town and has it all; location, local restaurants and nature abound.A pleasant park on the banks of the river offers watersports, kayaking, picnicking and walks. I stopped at the Miniature Railway exhibit, a labor of love that is continued by the founder’s son. It replicates the town of Clécy in miniature with trains running throughout and is well worth a visit. It was truly amazing, and with the lights off – it was simply wow! While the guided tour is in French only, there is a translation document in English, but no words are necessary.After eight hours of traveling, it was time to head back to Arromanches for a rest, dinner in town and sleep.After a very long day of riding on Saturday, Sunday was going to be more relaxing. I started by visiting the D-Day Arromanches museum that documents and explains the artificial harbors that were built by the Allies to support the logistics required for Operation Overlord. Remnants of the harbor in Arromanches, Mulberry B, are still visible in the water and on the beach. A second harbor, Mulberry A, was built at Omaha Beach for the Americans but was destroyed on June 14 by a major storm.Construction of these harbors was an impressive feat, especially considering the engineering skills available at that time. The area was constructed piece by piece in the UK in many sections, then towed over for installation. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and vehicles and millions of tons of equipment were unloaded at both harbors to support the Battle of Normandy, and were used until November 19, 1944. Simply incredible!I then hopped on Nellie and traveled west on the coastal road, stopping for the Sunday market at Port-en-Bessin. A short walk around this nice harbor town, a quick stop for lunch and off to Pointe du Hoc, a monument built by the French to honor the American Second Ranger Battalion. Before the Americans could land at Utah and Omaha beaches, the Rangers were tasked with taking out the artillery positions held by the Germans at Pointe du Hoc. If the artillery were not captured, the Americans would have been fired upon by these large German guns as they landed on the beach. However, to capture this position, the US Rangers had to scale 100-foot cliffs! Once the guns were found and captured, the Rangers blew them up with grenades. Out of 250 soldiers, only 90 survived without being killed or injured and were true heroes. A must-see: Remnants of the German bunkers and platforms housing the guns remain as well as a monument to the Rangers at the top of the cliff.I was back on Nellie for a quick stop at the German cemetery, a striking contrast to its American counterpart. The cemetery is well maintained and worth a visit. I made it to the American cemetery for the 5 p.m. lowering of the flag ceremony, which I found to be quite emotional. With 9,387 graves of US servicemen, one cannot help but feel connected to the soldiers who fought for freedom. A new visitors center was opened several years ago and is a wonderful place to learn about Operation Overlord and the D-Day operation. Museums abound in this area and you can spend days visiting them all.After returning to the B&B, Adrian provided gratis pizza to several of us chatting over drinks outside. The Triumph Street Triple couple and I agreed to ride east together the next morning to Benouville, where the famous Pegasus Bridge was captured by the British on D-Day. This capture was of strategic importance as it limited the Germans from reinforcing their positions and counter-attacking during the Battle of Normandy.On Monday, I joined everyone for breakfast, said my farewells and packed for the return to Paris. I had a nice ride to Pegasus Bridge, where it was raised to let a French Navy vessel pass. We enjoyed coffee, and I left at 1 p.m. to return the bike by the evening, as I had a three-to-four-hour ride ahead of me. I made it back by 4:30 p.m. after a few harrowing minutes navigating around the Arc de Triomphe, where 12 avenues converge into a roundabout. The total mileage allowed was 900 kilometers without additional payment, and I squeaked by with 870 km.Nellie served me well and was the perfect motorcycle for this short excursion.After 27 years with the U.S. Department of State as a foreign service security engineering officer, the writer retired in 2014 and moved to Ra’anana with his family.

The invasion resulted in a fiercely fought but decisive victory on the Western European front for the Allies that paved the way for the liberation of France and eventually the rest of Europe.Meticulously planned for over a year, D-Day, considered the largest amphibious invasion in world history, pitted tens of thousands of US, British and Canadian troops (buttressed by soldiers from other countries) against the heavily entrenched German forces. There was also significant air support.Within a week, the beaches were fully secured and more than 300,000 troops, 50,000 vehicles and some 100,000 tons of equipment had landed.Fighting in the area continued until August, when northern France was completely liberated. Both sides suffered thousands of casualties.As a result of D-Day, the Nazi momentum was halted and German troop morale plummeted. They were relentlessly driven back toward their borders. Within a year, Hitler committed suicide and Germany surrendered.Interesting fact: The “D” in D-Day actually did not stand for anything. The Allies so named it in order to mask the actual date and time – dubbed H-Hour – from Axis forces. Fake communications directed at the Nazis confused them into thinking the actual landing would be somewhere else, causing the Germans to be less prepared and slower to respond.– Jerusalem Post staff

Story 58
Argentina has traditionally been the most sophisticated Latin American country in terms of internet usage. Its consumers are tech-savvy, and years of instability have trained them to get what they want. Argentina is also an amazing producer of entrepreneurs, with a disproportionately large amount of Latin America’s startups coming out of that country. Just to mention a few cases, MercadoLibre (the largest e-commerce company in Latin America), Despegar.com (the largest online travel agency in the region), Globant (software) and Satellogic (a world pioneer in nano-satellites) all started in Argentina.
Just four years ago, Argentina was second only to Brazil as a market for cross-border merchants in Latin America. Unfortunately, capital controls, tight customs regulations and other barriers have made life very difficult for Argentineans, leaving the country behind smaller ones such as Colombia or Chile.
Why Are E-Commerce Sales In Argentina So Low?
To understand the situation, consider the case of Ana, a 35-year-old resident of Buenos Aires. Ana used to buy from DealExtreme, a popular Chinese website where you can buy cheap goods. She got an international credit card just for that purpose.
Then, a few years ago, payments started to fail. The same transaction would be successful one day and fail the next day. Rumors said that the central bank would block cross-border credit card transactions when reserves were low. It was bothersome, but Ana kept buying. This meant retrying every day and checking online forums for the newest ways around the hurdles.
Then, the government imposed a new measure: International parcels had to be picked up in person, in a few designated locations. The populist government of the Kirchners did not want hard currency to leave the country. In a huge and congested city like Buenos Aires, this meant spending three or four hours to retrieve a package. This did the trick, and Ana stopped buying everything except for a few things she could not find locally.
And then in 2013, Argentina imposed a 35% tax on cross-border credit card transactions. At that point, Ana gave up. When she really needed something, she would buy locally, or wait for a friend to travel. In some cases, the situation was extreme. Her husband owns a German car, and tires for that model were unavailable. The solution was to travel to neighboring Uruguay just to buy new tires.
What Changed?
In late 2014, a new government was elected. The current, business friendly government has lifted most of these restrictions. Ana is still skeptical. She has slowly started buying again. For her coming vacation in Punta del Este, she booked an apartment through AirBnB, and to her surprise, she managed to pay online. The previous year she had to pay in cash.
The government has now completely simplified customs clearance. At 60%, the tax is high, but compared to local prices it is still a bargain. She has recently bought some branded clothes at TiendaMIA.com (a Miami, Florida-based company that ships to Latin American countries). Even after shipping and taxes, the final price is cheaper than what is available locally. And she appreciates the fact that she can pay in local currency through PagoFacil or RapiPago, her favorite payment method.rs to return.
While cross-border e-commerce has stagnated under the previous government, local e-commerce has boomed. CACE (the Argentinean Chamber of E-Commerce Companies) reported a 61.7% growth in e-commerce in 2014 and projected 58% growth for the following year.
Argentina is now ready for takeoff; 75% of the population has internet access and 45% has a smartphone. You can expect this number to explode once import barriers are lowered, and for Argentina to become one of the fastest-growing markets for cross-border e-commerce in the world this year.
Is There Anything Businesses Should Be Doing Now?
Whoever is first to market will grab the spoils, so the time is now. There are a few things that you may need to consider:

The Government's revised National Planning Policy Framework has left local transport planners with enough wriggle room to support limiting parking spaces for major developments, senior sources have told Transport Network.
The NPPF, the central document for local planning, did not include wholesale the calls for absolute maximum parking standard rights, however a reform to the wording from the draft version has provided more grounds to build a case.
A major alliance of transport and planning groups - including the Local Government Technical Advisers Group (TAG) - had called for the Government to allow councils to set maximum parking standards in order to combat urban sprawl and congestion.
The document now states: 'If setting local parking standards for residential and non-residential development, policies should take into account:
a) the accessibility of the development;
b) the type, mix and use of development;
c) the availability of and opportunities for public transport;
d) local car ownership levels; and
e) the need to ensure an adequate provision of spaces for charging plug-in and other ultra-low emission vehicles.
'Maximum parking standards for residential and non-residential development should only be set where there is a clear and compelling justification that they are necessary for managing the local road network, or for optimising the density of development in city and town centres and other locations that are well served by public transport. In town centres, local authorities should seek to improve the quality of parking so that it is convenient, safe and secure.'
The section emphasising the case for 'optimising the density of development' was not included in the draft version.
TAG spokesman John Elliott told Transport Network: ‘Most Major urban areas have a congestion problem. Therefore it should be possible to demonstrate that there is a compelling justification that maximum parking should apply to alleviate this. Local Authorities probably need to get our act together and lay out the clear case as to why limiting parking provision and including public transport provision should apply to all major developments in urban areas.
'It’s necessary for managing the network and imperative that public transport provision is included in any new plans to meet this test outlined in the new NPPF.
'Building the series of individual cases for maximum parking standards should help developers get maximum value out of their land for spatial development.'

Candidates and issues have been filed for the May 7 primary election. The Licking County Board of Elections will meet Tuesday to certify candidates and issues to appear on the ballot. (Photo: Staff photo)
NEWARK – Licking County voters will head to the polls on May 7 to select candidates for Municipal Court judge, Newark City Council at-large and nine issues.
Republicans will have a contested primary for Municipal Court judge, with three candidates filed. B. Matthew George, James Hood and Deborah Lang filed their petitions with the Licking County Board of Elections before Wednesday's deadline.
George is Licking County Common Pleas Court magistrate. Hood has been the Reynoldsburg city attorney for 13 years. Lang is a magistrate in the Licking County Domestic Relations Court.
Democrats have two candidates for the open judge position, with Philip Proctor and Max Sutton seeking the office. Proctor is a Newark attorney practicing mainly in divorce and domestic relations law. Sutton, a local attorney, ran for mayor in 2011, previously served as president of the Downtown Newark Association and is president of the Licking County Bar Association.
Incumbent Judge Michael Higgins is not eligible to seek another term because of the state's mandatory judicial retirement age of 70.
In Newark, Democrats will have a primary election for Newark City Council at-large, with incumbent Bill Cost Jr. running with Daniel Crawford, Seth Dobbelaer and Jen Kanagy for three at-large seat nominations.
The Republicans will not have a primary for Newark City Council but have three candidates. Incumbents Ryan Bubb and Mark Fraizer seek re-election, as well as former councilman Jeff Harris.
Newark voters have two mayoral candidates, incumbent Republican Jeff Hall and Democratic councilman Jeremy Blake, who will face off in the November election.
Hall seeks his third term as Newark mayor, following two years as city treasurer. If victorious, Hall would match former Democratic mayor Frank Stare as the only mayors in city history elected to three consecutive four-year terms.
Blake has been an Ohio Senate staff member, former Newark School Board member and president, founding board president of the South Newark Civic Association and ran for state representative last year.
Each party also has a candidate for Licking County Municipal Court clerk, where incumbent Democrat Marcia Phelps and Republican Roy Van Atta will compete in the general election. Phelps is a former Licking County Commissioner. Van Atta is Licking County deputy auditor and executive director of the Licking County Land Bank.
The other Newark and Heath offices to be elected this year have only the incumbent filed for the election.
The Licking County Board of Elections meets 4:30 p.m. Tuesday to certify the candidates and issues for the primary ballot.
Independent candidates for the offices can file later, but must gather far more signatures to get on the ballot.

FREMONT - Sandusky County voters on Tuesday narrowly rejected a renewal of the health department's 0.5-mill levy, plus an additional 0.5-mill levy.
In Fremont, voters approved an ordinance to lower the penalty for misdemeanor marijuana offenses to $0 fines and $0 court costs.
County Health Department Commissioner Bethany Brown had said the department's proposed levy, if passed, would cost owners of a $100,000 home the equivalent of $31 a year in taxes.
Unofficial vote totals from the Sandusky County Board of Elections showed 10,502 no votes (52 percent) for the levy to 9,697 yes votes (48 percent).
"We were hoping more people would see the benefits we give to the community," Brown said Tuesday night.
The current levy results in the collection of about $500,000 annually for the department, Brown said.
She said the additional 0.5 mill levy was the first time the health department sought an increase in 30 years, and would have generated an additional $500,000 a year for the department.
Brown said the department would regroup and decide if it will put the levy on the May 2019 ballot.
The Fremont marijuana ordinance, which had been proposed by the group Sensible Fremont, passed with 56 percent of the voters approving the measure.
The proposed ordinance reads: "Shall the City of Fremont adopt the sensible marijuana ordinance, which lowers the penalty to a $0 fine and $0 court costs for misdemeanor marijuana offenses to the lowest penalty allowed by state law?"
Joe Linder, an organizer with Sensible Fremont, said in August that the marijuana ordinance is modeled after similar legislation passed in Toledo in 2015.
Linder said Chad Thompson wrote the proposed legislation to amend Fremont City Code Section 558, which deals with marijuana laws and penalties.
Other issues on Sandusky County ballots in Tuesday's election included:
• Sandusky Township - Renewal of 0.5 mill for current operating expenses for five years commencing 2018, and renewal of 0.5 mill for general construction, reconstruction, resurfacing, and repair of streets, roads and bridges for five years commencing 2018. It passed with 65 percent of township voters voting yes.
• Madison Township — Additional 2.3 mills for fire department operations for five years commencing 2018. The levy passed with 67 percent voting yes.
• Bellevue — Renewal of 2 mills for ambulance service and emergency medical services for five years commencing 2019. 71 percent of Sandusky County voters voted yes on the renewal levy.
• Ballville Township — Additional 1.25 mills for current operating expenses for five years commencing 2018. The levy failed, with 57 percent of township voters voting no.
• Scott Township — Renewal of 3 mills for fire protection for five years commencing 2018. The levy passed with 70 percent of voters voting yes.
• Old Fort Local School District — Renewal of 1 percent income tax for current expenses, continuing, beginning Jan. 1, 2020. In Sandusky County, the vote was tied with 52 votes for and against the renewal.
• Gibsonburg Exempted Village School District — Renewal of 1 mill for permanent improvements for five years, commencing 2019. This passed with 61 percent of the vote.
• Lindsey — Replacement of 4 mills for current operating expenses / five years / commencing 2019. This levy passed with 81 percent of the vote.
• Riley Township — Local Liquor Option for Jimmy Bukkett’s for Sunday sales. This local option passed with almost 68 percent of the vote.
• Fremont 4-D — Local Liquor Option for Aldi’s for Sunday sales. The local option passed with almost 68 percent of voters voting yes.
Several Sandusky County precincts reported heavier-than-normal voter turnout Tuesday, as voters cast their ballots for a number of local candidates and ballot issues, including a renewal of the Sandusky County Health Department's levy.
Poll workers at Anjulina's Catering and Banquet Hall on Hayes Avenue described turnout as steady, with one worker calling the number of voters in the midterm election as big as any she's seen even during a presidential election.
The board of elections reported voter turnout on Tuesday at 55 percent of the county's 40,243 registered voters.

Business owners in Morpeth have voted against creating a Business Improvement District (BID) in the town, after owners opposed levies used to finance the scheme.
The BID proposal aimed to boost Morpeth’s economy by increasing footfall in the centre of town, promoting the local area to a wider audience, and supporting businesses, but ultimately failed to get off the ground.
Plans were put forward by Morpeth BID Steering Group but faced staunch opposition from a number of local businesses, many of which were against the financial cost of setting up the BID.
BIDs are funded by local businesses and if the plans had been approve,d local ratepayers would have faced a levy of 1.4% of their rateable value.
Business owners were given four weeks to cast their vote on whether to approve their plans and by the end of the process 221 votes were cast, representing nearly 60% of the local business community.

Only 78 votes were cast in favour of the BID plans, 35.3% of the overall votes cast. The proposals required 50% of the votes to be approved.
Morpeth BID Steering Board said it was “disappointed by the result of the vote” but would “fully respect the ‘no’ outcome”.
In a statement Morpeth BID Steering Board said: “We know there were mixed views from businesses throughout the engagement process and this BID proposal has probably received more scrutiny than most BIDs due to the failure of the Hexham BID, which occurred during the Morpeth BID consultation and development process. This has had a significant, negative impact on the way the proposal was received.
“Every effort was made to alter the BID proposal to address the concerns of those smaller businesses, through an extensive engagement process, but it appears that the changes were not enough to gain their support.
“We still believe that there are many businesses who want to collaborate and commit resources to make Morpeth an even more successful town and this provides a level of momentum and an opportunity to move forward. Indeed, at a recent meeting held by the Town Council, those representatives from the ‘No’ Campaign, were clear that they supported most of the aspirations and projects in the Business Plan and Prospectus, but were against a compulsory levy.”
The Steering Board went on to say it was now “looking to the ‘No’ Campaigners to deliver their alternative” strategy.
The rejection of Morpeth BID is also a blow to Northumberland County Council, which has voiced its support for such schemes across the region. However, the council said it would only support BIDs that were backed by local businesses. The council also declined to vote in the ballot in an attempt to remain impartial.
Coun Richard Wearmouth, cabinet member for economic development and regeneration at Northumberland County Council, said: “I would like to thank everyone who took part in the ballot.
“As a council we are clear that BIDs must be supported by the business community and this ballot result means that a BID won’t be introduced in Morpeth.
“I am very hopeful, however, that the local business community will continue to work together to maintain and build on Morpeth’s strong reputation.”
Busines Improvement Districts have proved popular in other parts of the North East, with the NE1 BID in Newcastle responsible for a number of initiatives that have boosted city centre trade.
But the BID in Hexham is being wound down after proving unpopular with some traders.

LAKEWOOD, NY -- One of Upstate New York's biggest and best known craft brewers is expanding with a new "innovation brewery" and tasting room in downtown Cleveland.
Southern Tier Brewing Co., based in Lakewood just outside of Jamestown, will open this spring in Cleveland's Gateway District at 811 Prospect Ave. It's across from the Winking Lizard, a bar known for its big and diverse beer selection.
Southern Tier's new location will feature a line of 'Cleveland Brew'd' local specialty beer, plus the full Southern Tier roster, which includes beers like 2XIPA, Unearthly Imperial IPA, Pumking, and many more.
Southern Tier opened in 2002 in Lakewood, about 140 miles (or two hours) from Cleveland. It grew quickly, and now ships to 33 states, although its location makes Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Buffalo some of its core markets.
In 2016, it joined with the larger Victory Brewing Co. of Downington, Pa. to form a new company, Artisanal Brewing Ventures. Last year, the national Brewers Asscoaition ranked the combined Southern Tier/Victory partnership as the 22nd biggest brewer in America, and the 13th biggest craft brewer. Southern Tier and Victory continue to operate as separately branded breweries.
In 2015, Southern Tier opened a New York farm distillery at its Lakewood location. In January 2017, Southern Tier opened its first satellite location with a brewpub located in downtown Pittsburgh, near the stadiums used by the NFL Steelers and MLB Pirates.
The Cleveland location, according to a Southern Tier news release, will have a street-level tasting room and a barrel-aging basement lounge and will host weekly events. "The site will provide beer enthusiasts and the Cleveland community with access to a truly unique tasting experience," the release says.
It's also located a few blocks from the homes of the NBA Cleveland Cavaliers and the MLB Cleveland Indians.
"Since we opened our doors, we've really appreciated the number of people from Cleveland who have visited us in Lakewood, so I couldn't be happier to open a brewery there," Southern Tier founder Phin Demink said in the news release. "The neighborhood is fun, has a lot going on, and it's close to the Indians and Cavs. I can't wait to get in there and start brewing really cool beer."

Australian rock band Twelve Foot Ninja took to Australia-based crowdfunding platform Pozible in an effort to crowdfund a music video. The campaign ended in May of 2013 after raising $52,600 on a goal of $45,000. The big news at the time was that the campaign had broken Eskimo Joe’s record for a music act on Pozible.
Also of note: according to FasterLouder, one superfan of the band from Singapore dropped around $10,000 for the top reward tier which included a private concert and BBQ with the band among other perks.
The fruits of Twelve Foot Ninja’s crowdfunding labor have now been realized in the form of the video embedded below. No, it is not suitable for work. Yes, it is completely disgusting. You’ve been warned. Having said all of that, it’s pretty epic!

O’Connor was working for People’s Liberty , a philanthropic community organization based across the river from Covington in Cincinnati, when she latched on to how parkets can transform places. While managing People’s Liberty’s basement gallery, O’Connor began to wonder how they could draw the lunch crowd from the popular market across the street to the exhibit space. O’Connor and the People’s Liberty team installed a life-size version of Cards Against Humanity in a parking space in front of their organization, asking people to hang fill-in-the-blank responses to the prompt, “Cincinnati Needs…” from a piece of black plywood.
The Wish-Igloo is one of five parklets to pop up in Covington this past spring. Installed on May 6, they’ll be around through the end of October. Through a program called Curb’d , local businesses and design teams paired up to pitch ideas for the installations last fall. Out of a pool of 11 finalists, five were chosen, says Sam O’Connor, the founder and program manager of Curb’d.
In front of the Left Bank Coffeehouse in Covington, Kentucky, a giant wooden igloo-like structure sits flush against the sidewalk. It takes up an entire parking space. From its beams, passerby hang their personal, handwritten wishes out to flutter in the breeze.
But to expand her idea that would grow to be Curb’d, O’Connor looked across the Ohio river, to Kentucky, where they landed on Covington. “We wanted to find a neighborhood that would be as excited about the project as we were,” O’Connor says. Renaissance Covington, a local nonprofit, has been working to revitalize the city’s downtown area, focusing on promoting independent businesses unique to the Kentucky city; when O’Connor pitched the organization her idea, “they were immediately hooked,” she says.
For each of the five selected businesses, the parklets offer a whimsical interactive experience where a car would otherwise sit. The Braxton Brewing Company is now home to Hopscotch Gardens, where adults can sit with a beer while kids clamber through tiers of nooks and crannies and jump around on the sidewalk; they can also walk into Stoney’s Village Toy Shop, grab a mallet, and bang on the larger-than-life xylophone parklet there. At the Cutman Barbershop, the mini installation appeals to the storefront’s old-timey vibe with a boxing-ring theme, complete with Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots; the restaurant Inspirado takes dinner-and-a-movie to the next level with its parklet, Ride, named for its outdoor movie theater powered by stationary bikes.
Looking at Covington from above, the parkets form a line across the city, from east to west. This, O’Connor says, is intentional. Covington has two city centers: the downtown, and an area to the west called MainStrasse Village. “They seem like they’re completely separate from one another,” O’Connor says. “If people have dinner in downtown and want to do drinks in MainStrasse Village, they’ll take a taxi.” But it’s actually no more than an eight-minute walk between the two.
The parklets span downtown and MainStrasse, connecting the two areas. “It’s about creating destinations,” O’Connor says. If people plan to see the parklets, they’ll often seek out all of them; if they happen to come across just one, they’ll get interested in walking across town to see the rest. They’re designed as activities in and of themselves; unlike parklets in San Francisco or Chicago, O’Connor says, which are mostly aimed at providing more seating, Covington’s installations are focused on interaction.
It’s a model she thinks could work well everywhere. O’Connor has her sights on reaching other parts of the Cincinnati area. Funding is an issue (the Covington parklets were each awarded a $15,000 grant from the Haile Foundation, which also funds People’s Liberty), but the benefits of these mini parks, O’Connor hopes, will pay dividends.
“They’re just these great ideas,” she says. “They promote walkability, but also bring some character into the neighborhood.”

It’s been a good year for cryptocurrency investors but is the bubble about to burst? The market is fast learning that the usual rules don’t apply to a scarce digital commodity.
Even though bitcoin and its cryptocurrency peers are still far from being used for their intended purpose — digital cash to ease online spending, reducing bank fees and clearing times — the value of the biggest digital coins has grown beyond all expectations this year.
If you’re still new to bitcoin, blockchain, and the world of crypto, take a look at Verdict‘s guide here.
Read more: what you need to know before the next bitcoin crash
From bans in China to a historic fork in the bitcoin network, bitcoin has never been far from the headlines in 2017.
Verdict takes a look at just how far the seven biggest cryptocurrencies have come this year.
Bitcoin
The original and biggest cryptocurrency, bitcoin’s value is up a whopping 754 percent so far in 2017 and isn’t showing any signs of slowing down.
Bitcoin — created in 2009 by the mysterious person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto — is currently worth over $8,000 per coin while its market cap, the value of all bitcoins in existence, is some $137bn.
The coin’s value is highly volatile, last week bouncing across a $1,000 range, making the buying and selling of bitcoin in the short term very risky.
Some have suggested there could be widespread adaption of bitcoin in 2018, however with the technology and interface to use bitcoin to buy things beyond all but the most tech-savvy, bitcoin would appear to still be far from the mainstream.
Ethereum
3 Things That Will Change the World Today Get the Verdict morning email
The price of Ether, the digital token used on the Ethereum blockchain has climbed by a staggering 5,928 percent so far in 2017.
On 23 November the ether price broke $400 for only the second time in its history, setting a new all time high early on Thanksgiving morning in the US.
The value of all ether has just passed the $40bn mark.
The recent price surge came as the billionaire cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager on Wall Street, reversed his bearish prediction on Ethereum.
The main difference between Ethereum and bitcoin is that while bitcoin is just a digital currency, Ethereum is a ledger technology that companies are use to build new programs using ether as an exchangeable commodity on it.
Bitcoin Cash
Bitcoin Cash, the result of a fork in the bitcoin blockchain in August of this year, is up 203 percent so far this year.
Bitcoin Cash’s market cap is $28bn with each coin worth around $1,600.
Bitcoin Cash has positioned itself as a direct challenger to bitcoin, claiming to be able to make transactions quicker and cheaper though its critics say it is too central controlled by a small group of miners and investors.
The value of Bitcoin Cash rose rapidly earlier this month due to a spike in South Korean trade volumes.
Ripple
The price of Ripple is up 3,612 percent so far this year and it’s currently trading at around $0.24 with a market cap of $9bn.
Ripple is different from the likes of bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as it wants to work closely with existing financial services companies to speed up payments.
Ripple’s cross-border payments system is based on using its XRP cryptocurrency, which customers buy and sell almost instantaneously to move money between countries and currencies over the company’s system.
Earlier this month banking giants American Express and Santander teamed up with Ripple to speed up cross-border payments between the US and the UK by using blockchain technology.
It’s also done deals recently with France’s Crédit Agricole, Brazil’s Bexs Banco and Uruguay’s dLocal.
Dash
Dash, a a cryptocurrency created in 2014 using bitcoin as a base, is up an impressive 4,913 percent so far this year.
One Dash coin is currently worth $562.47 and has boomed in November thanks to KuvaCash, a pilot program intended to promote dash adoption in Zimbabwe.
Some in Zimbabwe — which has a notorious monetary policy history and struggled with hyperinflation — have turned to cryptocurrencies as an alternative to the country’s broken banking system.
Litecoin
The price of Litecoin is currently up by 1,612 percent so far this year.
One Litecoin is worth $74.08 at time of publication with some speculating that South Korean exchange Coinone’s decision to add Litecoin to its platform is the primary reason for a recent price jump.
Litecoin is again similar to bitcoin, using bitcoin’s code as it’s foundation and is designed to be quicker and cheaper than bitcoin.
Monero
The value of Monero is currently up by 1,045 percent so far this year.
One Monero coin is worth $158.57, and it’s thought the price has recently been boosted by South Korean trading — something that has pushed up all the big cryptocurrencies over recent months.
Monero is again similar to bitcoin, but uses a different protocol for its base and emphasises privacy — something bitcoin is known for but arguably could improve.

Story 74
Almost a year ago I wrote my blog “Blockchain and the Ripple effect: did it Ripple?”. Now twelve months later we may conclude it did. And even more than that. Ripple is making many waves. A lot happened both in broadening their offerings and in enlarging their network. A growing number of banks and payment providers, increasingly join RippleNet, Ripple’s decentralized global network, to “process cross-border payments efficiently in real time with end-to-end tracking and certainty”. By using the growing set of Ripple solutions they are able to expand payments offerings into new markets that are otherwise too difficult or too expensive to reach. The focus of Ripple therefor has especially moved towards emerging markets.

BROADENING RIPPLE OFFERINGS

Ripple was set up in 2012 to create a streamlined, decentralized global payments system named RippleNet, using technology inspired by the blockchain, to record transactions between banks. RippleNet is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform, that nowadays has over 100-member banks and financial institutions. These partners can use all the Ripple offerings.
Solutions
Ripple makes software products based on blockchain technology and sell them to banks, payment providers and others to be used on RippleNet. These are aimed to make cross border payments truly efficient for these players and their customers. Next to their digital asset XRP, the XRP Ledger, and xCurrent, that helps banks settle transactions, Ripple has added a number of new services/offerings to the platform including xRapid and xVia. This in order to attract more clients to enter RippleNet. Ripple is now taking the next step to help build the Internet of Value (IoV), by establishing an Infrastructure Innovation Initiative.
a. XRP: digital asset
From the outset, XRP, Ripple’s digital asset was expected to be an important part of Ripple’s decentralised payment system. Ripple uses its own XRP cryptocurrency as a payment method to make it easier for banks to move money internationally. Banks and payment providers can use Ripple’s digital asset XRP to further reduce their costs and access new markets. One rationale for using XRP is that unlike Bitcoin, the token has one narrowly defined (payments method!) but clearly useful purpose: to help banks move cash faster and more cheaply, especially across borders. The token could be used as a kind bridge currency between fiat currencies. For example South African rands in Johannesburg could become XRP, which could then be turned into baht in Thailand. That could help banks avoid the time consuming and expense of tying up money in different currencies in accounts at other banks.
b. xCurrent: processing payments
RippleNet is powered by xCurrent, for payment processing. xCurrent is the new name of Ripple’s existing enterprise software solution that enables banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking (and bidirectional messaging across RippleNet). It provides real-time messaging, clearing and settlement of financial transactions. The xCurrent messaging platform however does not involve XRP. It includes a Rulebook developed in partnership with the RippleNet Advisory Board to standardise all transactions across the network. That ensures operational consistency and legal clarity for every transaction. The Interledger Protocol (ILP) is the backbone of the solution and makes it possible for instant payments to be sent across a variety of different networks.
c. xRapid: sourcing liquidity
xRapid is one of Ripple’s newly developed solutions. It is aimed for payment providers and other financial institutions who want to minimize liquidity costs “while improving their customer experience”. This especially is useful in emerging markets where payments often require pre-funded local currency accounts around the world. As a consequence, liquidity costs are high.
xRapid uniquely uses digital asset, XRP, as a money-transmission medium. This to offer on-demand liquidity. By embracing XRP, banks and other providers will solve the liquidity issue most financial institutions face right now. With xRapid and XRP, financial institutions can eliminate the need for costly intermediaries or pre-funded Nostro accounts in destination currencies. This may dramatically lower the capital requirements for liquidity, thereby firmly lowering costs while enabling real-time payments in emerging markets.
“Ripple, XRP and fiat currency fit hand in glove. What we’re doing together is realizing one of the best use cases for frictionless transactions, which is international settlement. xRapid allows us to drive down the cost of currency exchange and global settlement, making our customers more competitive and saving them tens of millions of dollars each year.” Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple
d. xVia: sending payments
The xVia solution is also a newly presented product for corporates, payment providers and banks who want to send international payments across various networks (through a bank or payment provider) on RippleNet. By using a standard interface as a simple API, xVia enables users to send global payments with transparency into the payment status and with rich payment information (like invoices), without the need of software installation.
e. Internet of Value
Ripple is now taking the next step to help build the so-called Internet of Value (IoV). This by establishing an Infrastructure Innovation initiative. IoV is Ripple’s long-term vision for moving money the same way information moves today — instantly. The ideal global payments network works just like the internet does — by using a common language to connect all those disparate systems (read ledgers!).
“All ledgers should work the same way and use a simple, common language so that money can move around the world real-time, much like information does today — enabling the Internet of value. “Dilip Rao, leader Ripple’s Infrastructure Innovation team
The goal of the Initiative is to help central banks, regulators, and market infrastructures pilot real-world blockchain solutions. Potential blockchain solutions include creating regional networks, reducing the cost of payments and opening up networks to new participants while managing risks. Ripple’s vision is that in the in the future (5 to ten years from now?) there will be a large number of isolated payment networks (as supply chains of value - trading houses or clearing exchanges) that have adopted blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
This Internet of Value will depend on interoperability between all these ledgers. There is a global technical standard that provides this level of interoperability: The Interledger Protocol (ILP). ILP can connect any network or payment system, without fundamentally changing how they work. All banks and payment providers — from the smallest bank to the largest institution — can use the open protocol to power payments across networks globally.
“My first priority will be piloting interoperability between payment systems, the use of DLT for domestic clearing and settlement and novel applications of xCurrent as well as our digital asset XRP.” “I look forward to exciting new initiatives in building the internet of value in 2018!” Dilip Rao, leader Ripple’s Infrastructure Innovation team
ENLARGING THE RIPPLE NETWORK
Ripple continues to build a dominant position in the global-blockchain-market. Ripple has seen interest in its network continue to accelerate around the world. RippleNet, Ripple’s decentralized global network of banks and payment providers utilizing, has seen growing attention from established financial institutions as well as from new players like money transfer companies and remittance companies.
Growing partnerships in RippleNet
Ripple’s enterprise blockchain, network, RippleNet — is constantly growing. Now, more than 100 financial institutions — across banks, payments providers and specialised companies — wish to use the power of Ripple’s blockchain technology “to provide a global payments experience that delivers instant, certain, low-cost global payments to their customers”. Next to established banks like Banco Santander, Credit Agricole, Ripple is increasingly concluding partnerships with payment institutions that are involved in or dealing with emerging markets.
Recent new clients include names like Bexs Banco, AirWallax, Credit Agricole, Cuallix, Currencies Direct, dLocal, IFX, RAKBANK, and TransferGo, amongst others. The can be added to older existing partners such as SBI Remit, and Siam Commercial who also use RippleNet to send cross-border payments.
Increased focus on emerging markets
The focus of Ripple is increasingly on emerging markets, esp. in Asia, with a big emphasis on markets like India and Japan. This is not surprising as more and more companies are seeing RippleNet as the answer for providing near-instantaneous low-cost cross-border payments in these regions. By the way, these countries have some of the largest remittance markets around the world.
“The payments problem is a global problem, but its negative impact disproportionally affects emerging markets. Whether it’s a teacher in the U.S. sending money home to his family in Brazil, or a small business owner in India trying to move money to open up a second store in another country, it’s imperative that we connect the world’s financial institutions into a payments system that works for their customers, not against them.” Patrick Griffin, Ripple’s head of business development
Ripple recently announced new collaboration with two new banks (Itaú Unibanco) (Brazil) and IndisInd (India)) and three remittance providers (InstaReM) (Singapore), Beetech (Brazil) and Zip Remi (Canada)) joining RippleNet to facilitate payments both into and out of emerging, global markets.
Entering the growing remittances market
Migrant workers throughout the world annually send large volumes of earned money to their families mostly in emerging countries. Ripple’s solutions are seen as a significant step toward helping corporates and migrant workers around the world unlock trillions of dollars in trapped working capital, accelerate global commerce, and send vital funds home as quickly as possible. Using RippleNet may as a result afford partner companies the opportunity to expand into growing remittance markets.
“Joining RippleNet allows us to connect to other member banks, extending our remittance footprint. This will help us scale our business and provide customers a first-class digital payments experience.” Peter England, CEO at RAKBANK
“As one of the top 10 FX houses in Brazil, it is vital for us to use RippleNet to quickly and seamlessly connect our banks to other member banks in Asia and Europe — giving us the ability to send fast, low-cost payments.” Luiz Henrique Didier, Chairman at Bexs Banco
Broadening Ripple offices worldwide
Ripple, that has been committed to provide “frictionless global payment services to financial institutions around the world”, is actively opening new offices to serve their growing customer base. Next to its headquarter in San Francisco, Ripple has offices in New York, Sydney (2015), Japan (through a joint venture with SBI in early 2016), London (2017), and last summer in the U.K. To support Ripple’s rapidly-growing customer base across Asia-Pacific markets they recently expanded further with new offices in Singapore and Mumbai (India).
“Our new office can support this ambition and equally brings us closer to our customer base across the Asia-Pacific region, enabling banks, payment providers and corporates to make instant payments into-and-out of the country using blockchain. As a leading trade and fintech hub, Singapore offers Ripple leverage in the region as we expand our global footprint.” Dilip Rao, managing director for Ripple APAC

Real world Ripple practitioners
While most banks and payment services that partnered with Ripple are still in the testing-phase, since early this year a – small but - growing number of institutions are also practising it.
Banks like Siam Commercial in Thailand, Standard Chartered in Singapore, Axis in India and Rakbank in the UAE are among those companies that are already sending and receiving payments in commercial volumes. In Japan, 61 members of the Japan Bank Consortium are in pre-production stage on a hosted Ripple platform.
Most are thereby applying the Xcurrent solution, while xVaria also shows some uptake. Ripple is also speeding up plans for xRapid, an XRP-powered product that seeks to enhance cross-border payments for emerging markets. Many however are still reluctant to apply xRapid and XRP, and that is not that strange given the recent massive fluctuations in in the cryptocurrency markets.
Use of xCurrent
A growing number of companies are eager to utilize Ripple’s xCurrent offering for cross border transactions including remittances. Most recent names are LianLian, Itaú Unibanco, IndustryInd and InstaRem that wish to use this offering to facilitate real-time, cross-border transactions to its customers, over the blockchain. Through the recent partnership with LianLian, RippleNet can now also provide instant access into emerging markets such as India, Brazil and China, some of the world’s largest remittances markets.
LianLian
Recently, Hong Kong-based money service LianLian (the fourth largest payment processor in China) officially partnered with Ripple in order to make use of the company’s blockchain technology to process real-time cross-border payments into China. With RippleNet, LianLian will be able to provide merchants and consumers with on-demand payments, which they weren’t able to before. Under the terms of the agreement between LianLian and Ripple, the company will make use of the xCurrent platform for all of their settlement requirements. This platform will allow LianLian to connect to other Asian banks who are using the RippleNet network already. Those consumers who bank with these other institutions will be able to easily and effectively buy products on a large Chinese e-tailer in their own currency.
Axis Bank/Standard Chartered/RAKBANK
To meet the increasing demand for real-time payment services, Axis Bank (based in India), Standard Chartered (Singapore), and RAKBANK (United Arab Emirates) will now use RippleNet to send live, fast, frictionless cross-border payments. These three major banks use Ripple’s leading enterprise-blockchain solution xCurrent to power real-time, on-demand corporate payments from Standard Chartered to Axis Bank, and retail remittance payments from RAKBANK to Axis Bank beneficiaries.
Retail remittances between the two countries are significant and growing, thanks to the large Indian workforce in the UAE. These workers send a significant proportion of their salaries home every year, which RAKBANK wants to support with faster, easier, and more transparent payments between both countries. Processing individual remittance payments over RippleNet will allow RAKBANK to offer their retail customers an easier, more affordable experience, helping them to increase their market share in this crowded and competitive space.
Japan Bank Consortium (JBC)
The Japan Bank Consortium (JBC) — a collection of 61 Japan-based bank members brought together by SBI Holdings and SBI Ripple Asia — has made significant progress to become production-ready on RippleNet. JBC and Ripple worked together closely to create a unified platform for domestic and cross-border payments using Ripple solution xCurrent for real-time settlement. Aim is simplify international money transfers, reduce correspondent and operational costs, expand access to foreign banks, and increase visibility into the status of payments.
In addition, early 2018 JBC released an API connection called Common Gateway that provides banks with easy access to xCurrent on the shared platform. When ready, Japanese banks will easily connect to other member banks in Ripple’s network — furthering their reach with real-time global settlement. Each bank will have the ability to use Ripple solutions to send real-time, low-cost, transparent domestic and cross-border payments.
Japan Bank Consortium / Korean Banks
The Japan Bank Consortium has announced the launch of a new Ripple pilot with two of South Korea’s largest banks. The Japan Bank Consortium will use Ripple’s settlement technology, xCurrent, to settle transactions between participating Japanese banks and South Korea’s Woori Bank or Shinhan Bank. The pilot solidifies the Japan Bank Consortium’s commitment to modernize payment systems — specifically in the Japan/Korea corridor where Korea is Japan’s third largest trade partner — to send money instantly, removing the need for intermediaries while reducing the cost of sending global payments.
Itaú Unibanco/InstaReM
In the case of remittance companies, new partners Itaú Unibanco (Brazil’s largest private sector bank) and InstaReM (Singapore’s major remittance provider), have announced their plans to use xCurrent. InstaReM which processes more than 500,000 transactions per year, is thereby focusing on connecting businesses and individuals from Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and India.
“We are pleased to partner with Ripple. Now, RippleNet members will be able to process a large number of payouts in Southeast Asian countries through InstaReM’s secure rails.” Prajit Nanu, co-founder and CEO of InstaReM


Use of XRapid
xRapid is also being tested by some of the top five money transfer companies worldwide. As of January 2018, MoneyGram,MercuryFX, IDT Corporation and Cuallix, have publicly announced their pilot use of XRP in payment flows through xRapid. Their aim is to settle retail remittances and corporate transactions quickly and to provide liquidity solutions for their cross-border payments, so enabling on-demand liquidity for global payments.
Cuallix
The Mexican financial services firm Cuallix was the first worldwide institution to announce its use of xRapid and XRP as a liquidity tool for cross-border money transfers. By doing this Cuallix , a credit and payments processing provider based in the US and Mexico, wishes to reduce the cost of sending cross-border payments. Since October it has used XRP in 10 to 12 transactions to send money between the two countries.
MoneyGram
Ripple had recently partnered with the large money remittance company, MoneyGram, based in Dallas, Texas. MoneyGram expressed its wish to use XRP in its payments flows through the xRapid protocol to speed up their remittances at partner banks, reducing the costs of transferring money, while giving customers visibility into the status of their payments. On Jan. 11, Ripple announced that MoneyGram would begin testing the XRP cryptocurrenncy for sending remittances.
“Ripple claims an average transaction on its network takes between two and three seconds to process. By using XRP, MoneyGram would be able to move money "as quickly as information." Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse
Mercure FX and IDT Corporation
Mercure FX and IDT Corporation – two other payment transfer companies - were the last to partner with Ripple using xRapid.
“Digital assets promise fast transaction speeds but XRP is far faster than all of them, including bitcoin. Cutting settlement times from hours and days to just three seconds or less will remove billions of dollars in unnecessary intermediary fees.” Alastair Constance, CEO and founder of Mercury FX.
“We’re excited to pilot Ripple’s xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost.” Alfredo O’Hagan, senior vice president of IDT’s consumer payments business

Use of xVia
Another two remittance providers, Beetech in Brazil and Zip Remit in Canada, have also joint RippleNet, using Ripple's xVia API to open payment corridors for their customers around the world. Additionally, both companies will look to establish a connection for their customers into China via e-commerce network LianLian, which signed up to RippleNet in January.

LianLian
LianLian will utilize xVia, Ripple’s standard interface for corporates, payment providers and banks interested in sending cross-network payments. xVia’s simplicity and ease of use are attracting further attention from China, thanks in large part to LianLian International’s recent agreement to join RippleNet.
Beetech/Zip Remit
The other two fast-growing remittance providers, Beetech of Brazil and ZipRemit from Canada that recently entered the RippleNet will also be using Ripple’s xVia technology solution with open payment gateways for its customers from around the world.
VISION OF INTERNET OF VALUE
To realise its vision of Internet of Value more payments institutions must use Ripple’s solutions in a much higher volume. But most benefits in terms of cost savings can be realised when using Ripple's xRapid including the related XRP cryptocurrency. The problem is however that a number of partners – especially some global banks - are now moving away from the idea of ​​using XRP. And that is understandable given the spectacular events on the world’s cryptocurrency markets recently including the enormous fluctuations.
“For Ripple to grow, it needs large banks to buy its payment software and use its XRP cryptocurrency, a major challenge considering it must convince financial institutions to change how they’ve been doing business for years. The biggest obstacle in convincing banks to use Ripple’s services is that many banks have other IT-related projects that are a greater priority to them than Ripple”. Garlinghouse said.
Regulation is however needed to create more stability in the cryptocurrency markets (see my recent block “Regulating Cryptocurrencies: Walking the Tightrope”, 12 February 2018) As soon as cryptocurrency regulations have taken a definitive path, banks and financial institutions can really start using xRapid and XRP for cross-border payments so getting the most benefits out of these Ripple solutions. In that case Ripple might become a rolling coaster!

Sensible Fremont has put a proposed ordinance on the November ballot to change the eliminate fines and court costs for misdemeanor marijuana offenses in Fremont. (Photo: Daniel Carson/The News-Messenger)Buy Photo
FREMONT - A proposed city ordinance that would eliminate misdemeanor marijuana possession-related fines and court costs is one of several issues that will be on the ballot in November.
The Sandusky County Board of Elections released a list of ballot issues after the Wednesday 4 p.m. filing deadline that qualified for November's general election.
Included in those issues is a marijuana ordinance for Fremont voters proposed by the group Sensible Fremont.
The proposed ordinance reads:
"Shall the City of Fremont adopt the sensible marijuana ordinance, which lowers the penalty to a $0 fine and $0 court costs for misdemeanor marijuana offenses to the lowest penalty allowed by state law?"
Joe Linder, an organizer with Sensible Fremont, said the marijuana ordinance is modeled after similar legislation passed in Toledo in 2015.
Linder said Chad Thompson wrote the proposed legislation to amend Fremont City Code Section 558, which deals with marijuana laws and penalties.
"We can't affect that marijuana possession is a misdemeanor charge. But we can affect the costs," Linder said Thursday in an interview inside the Hookah Connection on West State Street.
Fremont police recorded 34 arrests for marijuana possession and 17 for possession of marijuana paraphernalia in 2017.
So far this year, the police department has made 21 possession arrests and 10 for marijuana paraphernalia possession.
Fremont Law Director Jim Melle said the city approved the proposed ordinance's ballot language, with the board of elections verifying petition signatures.
Melle said the effort to get the ordinance on the ballot came solely from Sensible Fremont and did not involve Fremont City Council.
Linder said Sensible Fremont organizers got about 900 signed petitions over the course of roughly six months to get the proposed marijuana ordinance on the ballot.
He said a lot of residents gave positive feedback on the proposed legislation, with some people saying they were not aware that the state had approved medical marijuana or that other cities had removed fines for misdemeanor marijuana charges.
The end goal for him and other marijuana advocates is for the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, Linder said, with the drug regulated, sold and taxed like alcohol.
The state approved use of medical marijuana in 2016 and final preparations are under way for its production, processing and sales.
Linder said he thinks Ohio will legalize recreational marijuana in the next couple of years.
Sharie Chagnon, the board of elections' deputy director, said the proposed Fremont marijuana ordinance language has not yet been approved by the Secretary of State’s office.
Other issues on Sandusky County ballots in November include:
• Sandusky County Health District - Renewal and increase 0.5 mill for necessary expenses for five years commencing 2019
• Sandusky Township - Renewal of 0.5 mill for current operating expenses for five years commencing 2018, and renewal of 0.5 mill for general construction, reconstruction, resurfacing, and repair of streets, roads and bridges for five years commencing 2018.
• Madison Township - Additional 2.3 mills for fire department operations for five years commencing 2018.
• Bellevue - Renewal of 2 mills for ambulance service and emergency medical services for five years commencing 2019.
• Ballville Township - Additional 1.25 mills for current operating expenses for five years commencing 2018.
• Scott Township - Renewal of 3 mills for fire protection for five years commencing 2018.
• Old Fort Local School District - Renewal of 1 percent income tax for current expenses, continuing, beginning Jan. 1, 2020
• Gibsonburg Exempted Village School District - Renewal of 1 mill for permanent improvements for five years, commencing 2019.
• Lindsey - Replacement of 4 mills for current operating expenses / five years / commencing 2019.
• Riley Township - Local Liquor Option for Jimmy Bukkett’s for Sunday sales.
• Fremont 4-D- Local Liquor Option for Aldi’s for Sunday sales.

Made from organic and non-GMO’d local ingredients, it’s 80 percent corn, 20 percent wheat, bottled at 90 proof, and aged in oak barrels made by a small artisanal cooperage. Named for the door on the house Liedholm grew up in (also the bottle’s picture) the bourbon has a graham cracker, vanilla, caramel lushness, with floral notes and an approachable nature, ideal for both sipping and mixing.
In addition, though it’s not whiskey, I’d be remiss if not mentioning Bothell-based Wildwood’s other recent release, Ärande grappa. Made from Chenin blanc grapes, its slightly sweet, red apple, grape, and raisin layers are sure to turn reluctant tasters into grappa fans (those already fans of this misunderstood spirit are sure to sing with joy). It’s only available at the Bothell tasting room, and more Wildwood grappas are on the way.
2bar Rye: Like a number of our local releases, this is a limited-scope bottling, just one big 30-gallon barrel. It’s also only available for pick up at the distillery in SoDo, so head down and get it while you can – but also be on the lookout for future rye releases from 2bar.
Aged two years and bottled at 90 proof, this rye is crafted from 65 percent rye, 10 percent corn, and 25 percent malt (and is “grain-to-glass” as the fine folks at 2bar like to say). It delivers a sweet and spice personality – think caramel, pepper, baking spices, cinnamon – with a memorable buttery and smoky finish that shines in cocktails, solo, or with a little ice.
Woodinville Whiskey Port Finished Bourbon: The second batch of the rapidly-runs-out Port Finished straight bourbon from Woodinville Whiskey came out mid-February, and you might still be able to pick some up at the tasting room.
It starts with their five-year straight bourbon (which won 2016 whiskey of the year from the American Distilling Institute), which is finished for six months in Port barrels first used by local Port producers. The extra time in Port – barrels, that is – adds hints of candied cherry, dried plums, berries, and chocolate to the bourbon, as well as a slightly thicker mouthfeel.
Scratch Whiskey: The very first whiskey from this renowned Edmonds gin-maker was released on January 20, created from a singular mash bill that included spelt, millet, soft white winter wheat, and malted barley (in that order as far as amounts), with all grains organic and from the Skagit Valley. It was a heady mixture, with cereal grains, honey, and caramel on the nose flowing into honey, caramel, and chocolate on the tongue.
Sadly, I’ve just found out that it’s already sold out, but they are hard at work on the next batch, which is scheduled to release in November. Don’t miss out by picking up a future now, ensuring you get a bottle. Find out how here.

Story 79

As the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends Friday, a spate of recent terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists — including massacres in Tunisia and Kuwait — has marred a time intended for contemplation and prayer.
But for Muslim American immigrants in the Washington area, this Ramadan has offered an opportunity to send a contrasting message about Islam and to engage in unprecedented public outreach.
Dozens of interfaith events have been held in mosques, embassies and government offices. Muslim charity drives have raised funds for damaged African American and Pakistani churches. Families have opened their homes to neighbors and colleagues to break the daily fast with evening feasts.
One of the largest events was an interfaith Ramadan dinner Sunday at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) mosque in Sterling, Va., where the hundreds of guests included FBI officials, Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D), local politicians and candidates for office, and leaders of area churches, synagogues and other worship communities.
“We condemn all terrorism, and we condemn ISIS, which is a twisted, horrific deviation from Islam,” Rizwan Jaka, outreach director for ADAMS, said in an interview, using a common term for the Islamic State. He said the rise of the group — whose leaders vowed to make Ramadan a time of “calamity for the infidels” — had created “a lot of confusion” and abetted “anti-sharia hysteria” in American society.

“We are asked left and right what we are doing to counter radicalization,” Jaka said. “Well, we are leading the way.”
Other parts of the country have experienced scattered incidents of violence and confrontation in recent months, including the shooting deaths of three Muslim college students in North Carolina and the attack on a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Texas by gunmen who claimed a link with the Islamic State.
But the Washington area has become a relative oasis for Muslim Americans, a fast-growing immigrant populace that has attained increasing social integration, economic success and political clout.
Many recall feeling ostracized after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; some described hateful outbursts from strangers or scarf-pulling in school. But no one interviewed at mosques, homes and public events across the region this month said they had faced anything more discomfiting since the rise of the Islamic State than stares in the Metro or extra questions at airport security checkpoints.
The change, they said, is partly a result of growing familiarity, with Muslims more numerous in the region and the country than 14 years ago. The Pew Research Center in Washington estimates that the number of Muslim Americans reached 2.6 million by 2010 and will grow to 6.2 million by 2030. In the Washington region, the Council on American Islamic Relations puts the populace at about 250,000.
A growing voice in the area
In some regions, the growing number of Muslim families, businesses and mosques has created tension and suspicion. But in the Washington area, Muslims have become better organized, more confident, and more connected with government and law enforcement agencies, as the high-level official turnout at the ­ADAMS dinner suggested.
“In other areas, there is still a lot of ignorance, but people here are educated, they know us and our kids have grown up together,” said Qaith Abdo, 68, a technology specialist from Jordan who attends a mosque in Silver Spring. Once, Abdo said, a driver shouted at him to go back to his country. “That was back in 2003, and there has been no such incident since,” he said.

On the other hand, many Muslims here said the surge of extremist violence abroad, paralleled by the growth of Islamophobia in parts of the United States, had galvanized them to try to foster a magnanimous, nonviolent image of Islam.
To this end, Muslim organizations are increasingly aiming their efforts at victims from other minorities and faiths, especially African Americans. One group distributed food in Baltimore after a surge of unrest over the death of Freddie Gray, who died of injuries he suffered in police custody in April. During Ramadan, an Internet campaign raised $45,000 in Muslim circles to help rebuild black churches that had been burned down.
Another kind of venture is using innovative business marketing to break down religious barriers. One of the Muslim practices least understood by Westerners is the use of water for washing after using the toilet instead of relying on toilet paper. Sonia Rehman, a Pakistan-born psychologist in Fairfax, has worked with her husband, Tariq to design a variety of attractive water jars called “Aquabeans” and promote them for sale as an environmentally-sound alternative to toilet paper.
“Our goal is to connect American cultural identity with Muslim lifestyle,” Rehman said. She noted that thousands of American restaurants now sell “halal” food, ritually blessed for Muslims. “You can even get halal Philly cheese steak,” she said. “But with watering jars, people usually hide them from white guests or colleagues to avoid questions. Now we can tell them Aquabean is another way to go green.”
In the shadow of attacks
Although local Muslim immigrants have faced relatively little harassment, they are keenly aware of the tensions percolating in other parts of the country. Legislators in more than 20 states have introduced laws to ban Muslim practices in the name of curbing “foreign” ideologies.
They also worry that their efforts to cultivate a moderate image are competing with images of each new Islamic State atrocity, domestic terrorist attacks such as the Boston marathon bombing and Internet recruitment of Muslim youths by extremist groups. Authorities are also investigating the shooting deaths of four Marines at a Navy facility in Tennessee on Thursday as a possible terror attack.
In the Washington area, there have been several high-profile cases, including the indictment of 11 Muslim men for using paintball exercises to train for attacks on India, and the FBI pursuit of a Somali cab driver for allegedly supporting Islamist militias in Somalia.
“It feels like there is a split personality within Muslims these days,” said Ahmed Mahmood, a Muslim student leader at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. “We may feel very secure in our own communities, and internally we have resolved this debate about terrorism, but externally it feels like there is a shadow that looms over you.”
At ADAMS, Jaka said leaders have counseled young Muslims who seemed drawn to militant ideas and have formed close ties with county police and the FBI. A Northern Virginia group called MakeSpace enrolls Muslim students and young professionals to “develop an American Muslim identity” through education, civic engagement and community service.
Other ideas have emerged from recent “hackathon” conferences, including a project called “champions of Islam,” which aims to create superhero role models for Muslim youths. “Groups like ISIS recruit on the basis of Islamic masculinity and say they are defending the community,” said Maryland lawyer Asma Uddin, who created the project. She said this appeal has created a “crisis of manhood among Muslim men, and they need positive champions.”
Neighborly acts
Many local Muslims said the best method of countering public fears is not making grand gestures, such as holding interfaith dinners or giving money to charities, but simply being a good neighbor or colleague.
One mosque leader said he won over a suspicious new neighbor by plowing the person’s driveway after several snowstorms. Tariq Rehman, a urologist, said he first met with suspicion when he set up a medical practice in rural West Virginia but that over time he built a good reputation and starting introducing patients to his faith. “I add 10 minutes to each appointment, and I talk with clients about what Islam is really about,” he said.
Muslim women in the area have become especially active as ambassadors for their faith, in part because wearing a headscarf immediately identifies them. By contrast, young Muslim men in jeans and short beards may easily blend into ethnically diverse campuses and social gatherings.
Nada Mousa, 19, a student at American University, said she had not been harassed since she was a Maryland high school student and someone pulled off her scarf and called her a terrorist. Now, she said, her college peers are “more mature and aware,” but the brutal behavior of the Islamic State has made life more difficult in other settings.
“When you go for a job interview, you have to decide whether to wear the hijab or not. It becomes a struggle between your faith and your profession,” she said. Mousa said she was working on a Web site aimed at showing that Muslim women are “normal, we like to draw and sing and dance.” And when people ask her questions about Islam, even ignorant or offensive ones, she said, she is always polite.
“I want to present them with a choice,” she said. “Do we trust people who behead others and claim to represent Islam, or do we trust this sweet girl on our street?”

L'innovation à l'occidentale, ce sont des budgets colossaux de R&D et des armadas de chercheurs qui conçoivent des produits toujours plus sophistiqués pour des marchés de plus en plus saturés. Ce modèle a-t-il vécu ? D'Inde nous vient le jugaad (le système D local), une forme d'innovation frugale, plus modeste, mais mieux adaptée. Elle devient « innovation inversée » lorsque des industriels occidentaux l'adoptent pour leurs propres pays.

Comment mieux résoudre les problèmes du quotidien d'une population très nombreuse et très disparate, disposant d'un pouvoir d'achat très faible et d'un accès limité à des ressources essentielles comme l'électricité ou l'eau ? Devant l'impossibilité de donner des réponses globales à l'échelle d'un pays-continent peuplé de 1,2 milliard de personnes, des entrepreneurs sociaux indiens ont développé une stratégie d'adaptation au cas par cas, à l'échelle de l'économie locale, qu'on désigne sous le nom d'innovation frugale. Elle se fonde sur des petites innovations pratiques pour concevoir des équipements qui satisfont leurs besoins, quand l'industrie classique échoue à concevoir un produit adapté à leurs conditions matérielles de vie.
Quelques exemples : l'absence d'accès à l'électricité prive les campagnes indiennes des bienfaits du réfrigérateur ? Mansukh Prajapati, un potier désormais célèbre, conçoit un modèle en argile, qui ne consomme pas d'électricité, mais permet de conserver les aliments plusieurs jours. Une révolution sanitaire parce qu'elle permet la conservation de tout ce qui n'est pas consommé le jour même, mais aussi sociale, car elle libère les femmes de la tâche de collecte quotidienne d'aliments frais. Mitticool, son entreprise, développe bien d'autres produits, comme des filtres à eau en argile.
Au Kenya, des entrepreneurs sociaux ont imaginé un moyen astucieux de recharger les téléphones portables : en pédalant, tout simplement. Lorsqu'on sait que dans ce pays, 30 % des transactions se font par paiement mobile, on voit l'intérêt pour une population qui n'a le plus souvent aucun accès aux banques. Les grands industriels emboîtent le pas. Nokia a conçu un chargeur de mobile à fixer sur un vélo, entraîné par la roue. En Chine et au Brésil, le fabricant d'équipements électriques Legrand conçoit et fabrique des disjoncteurs modernes, à bas coût, performants et conformes aux usages locaux, pour équiper des programmes de logements sociaux.

La pratique de l’innovation frugale est aussi utile dans les pays riches
Cette innovation bottom-up profite donc également aux industries de pointe. C'est en constatant que le prix de ses électrocardiographes était trop élevé pour que l'usage s'en généralise en Inde, que l'américain GE a conçu et fait fabriquer en Chine le MAC 400, un électrocardiographe réduit à l'essentiel (absence d'écran, de clavier, etc.), mais parfaitement fiable et fonctionnel, disponible pour un prix dix fois inférieur à ses modèles classiques. Autre projet novateur, toujours dans le domaine médical : pour lutter contre l'épidémie de diabète en Inde, aggravé par l'éloignement d'une grande partie de la population des centres hospitaliers, le docteur Mohan, diabétologue reconnu, a eu l'idée d'un service de télédiagnostic par satellite. Le satellite existait, son accès a été fourni gratuitement par le gouvernement. Restait à former un réseau de personnes pour arpenter le terrain : une solution typique de l'innovation frugale.
Cette approche modeste de l'innovation est bien un nouveau paradigme, qui pourrait révolutionner nos économies occidentales. Développer des produits efficaces et bon marché pour les pays émergents puis les vendre aussi dans les pays riches : c'est ce que l'on appelle désormais l'innovation inversée (ou reverse innovation en anglais). Le MAC 400 de GE, conçu pour les marchés indiens et chinois, est désormais disponible en Europe. La Logan de Renault, destinée aux marchés émergents, est un succès commercial indéniable en France et dans les autres pays européens. La frugalité est en marche...

Rail/Trail Myths
Myth : There isn’t room for both rail AND trail.
Truth: Within the 32 miles of the corridor, 31.7 miles are currently wide enough for both rail AND a paved trail that is 12-16 feet wide, wider than other local trails such as Arana Gulch. Adjacent public land is available for use on the narrowest 0.3 miles of the corridor to provide the minimum required width.
Myth: “Railbanking” is a solution.
Truth: Railbanking is a deeply flawed concept. Not once, anywhere, has railbanking been used to rip out tracks, replace them with a paved path, then later remove the path and put tracks back, and restart rail service.
Myth: There isn’t money available for the Rail Trail.
Truth: The Rail Trail is essentially fully funded thanks to voter-approved Measure D, local fundraising commitments, and matching funds from state and federal government sources. Future rail service could be funded through a combination of State SB-1 and Measure D funds.

With the statewide housing crisis at the forefront of the California Legislature's 2017 agenda, legislators unleashed an avalanche of more than 130 bills this year. Housing advocates have argued, back by staggering statistics, that California's local land use approval process has slowed housing production and made it more expensive.1 After vetoing housing bills in the past, Gov. Jerry Brown approved 15 housing bills for the first time in his tenure on Sept. 29, 2017. Some of these laws streamline entitlement processing and attempt to reduce local agencies' discretionary approval rights in order to remove local hurdles to housing. These laws provide political "coverage" to decision-makers in development-friendly jurisdictions looking to approve projects in the face of vocal community opposition and also increase the ability to enforce development rights in less friendly jurisdictions where decision-makers oppose new development. More generally, other laws evidence the statewide goal to encourage housing production now that the lack of housing supply is reaching emergency levels.
The following analysis summarizes each new law, grouped into the following categories: (I) Enforceability, (II) Streamlining and Other Incentives, (III) Housing Element Law Amendments, (IV) Funding and (V) Other.
I. Enforceability
1. SB 167 (Skinner)/AB 678 (Bocanegra) and AB 1515 (Daly) Housing Accountability Act amendments. These laws strengthen the Housing Accountability Act (HAA), also known also known as the "Anti-NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) Act." As background, the purpose of the HAA is to limit the ability of local agencies to deny or make infeasible qualifying housing developments without making specified findings that require the analysis of the environmental, economic and social effects of the action. In short, SB 167/AB 678 strengthens the HAA by increasing the standard of proof required for a local government to justify a denial of low- and moderate-income housing development projects. AB 1515 provides for a broader range of housing projects to be afforded the protections of the HAA if the project is consistent with local planning rules. Taken together, and as reported previously (see Holland & Knight's alert, "California Governor Signs into Law Major Reforms to Housing Accountability Act," Sept. 29, 2017), amendments to the HAA include the following:
a) Increased Eligibility for Mixed-Use Projects. The HAA previously permitted a limited set of mixed-use projects to qualify for the Act's protections. Under the revised HAA, a mixed-use project qualifies as long as at least two-thirds of its square footage is designated for residential use.
b) Tightening the Definition of "Objective Standards ." Some anti-housing jurisdictions have attempted to avoid the HAA by making claims that a project does not comply with the jurisdiction's "objective" standards and criteria. The reformed HAA establishes a standard that is very favorable to housing developers and advocates: A project must be considered consistent with objective standards as long as "there is substantial evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude" that a project complies. If a local government determines that a project does not comply with the jurisdiction's objective standards, it must inform applicants of the basis for this conclusion on a specific timeline, and if the local government fails to do so, the project is legally deemed to be consistent. The new law also clarifies that a project's eligibility for a bonus under California's Density Bonus Law does not render it inconsistent with the local jurisdiction's objective standards.
c) Jurisdictions Can Apply Only Those Standards in Effect at the Time the Application Is Complete. Some jurisdictions have attempted to adopt new objective standards for the purpose of avoiding the HAA. The revised act clarifies that, for affordable housing projects as well as market-rate projects, changes to the change to the zoning ordinance or general plan made subsequent to the date the application was deemed complete are not a valid basis to disapprove a project.
d) Increasing the Burden on Jurisdictions that Reject Housing . Any local government that disapproves or reduces the size of a housing development project must now meet the more demanding "preponderance of the evidence" standard – rather than the more deferential "substantial evidence" standard – in proving that it had a permissible basis under the HAA to reject the project or reduce its density.
e) Increased Availability of Attorney's Fees. California's Fifth District Court of Appeal had previously interpreted the Act to authorize an award of plaintiff's attorney's fees only when a local government rejects an affordable housing project. The revised HAA overrules this interpretation, making attorney's fees available – and presumptively required – regardless of whether the project contains affordable housing.
f) Increased Fines and Increased Authority for Court to Order Projects to Be Approved . The Act previously limited the circumstances under which a court could issue fines or directly order a local government to approve a project. Under the revised HAA, after a successful court challenge, a court must issue an order compelling compliance with the HAA, and any local government that fails to comply with such order within 60 days must be fined a minimum of $10,000 per housing unit and also may be ordered directly to approve the project. If an agency does not carry out a court order within 60 days, a court may also directly order the jurisdiction to approve the project rather than merely order it to comply with the Act. If a local jurisdiction acted in bad faith when rejecting the housing development, the applicable fines must be multiplied by five.
2. AB 72 (Santiago/Chiu) HCD oversight. This law strengthens the ability of the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to enforce housing laws that require local governments to achieve housing goals.
a) Increased HCD Oversight of Local Agency Compliance with Housing Element Law . Specifically, it requires HCD to review any action or failure to act by a local agency that it determines is inconsistent with an adopted housing element and to issue findings whether the action or failure to act substantially complies with the housing element. If HCD finds that the action or failure to act by the agency does not substantially comply with the housing element, HCD may, after allowing no more than 30 days for a local agency response, revoke its findings until it determines that the city, county, or city and county has come into compliance with the housing element.
b) HCD Obligation to Report Violation to Attorney General's Office . The law also requires HCD to notify the city, county, or city and county as well as authorizes HCD to notify the Office of the Attorney General that the city, county, or city and county is in violation of state law (including the HAA, state density bonus law and "no net loss" in zoning density law) if HCD makes certain findings of noncompliance or a violation.
II. Streamlining and Other Incentives
3. SB 35 (Weiner) "By Right" Approval Processing. This law streamlines the approval process for infill developments in local communities that have failed to meet their regional housing needs.
a) Ministerial Approval Processing . The law authorizes a development proponent to submit an application for ministerial processing where a multifamily housing development satisfies specified planning objective standards and specified criteria. The law includes a long list of qualifying criteria, including payment of prevailing wages, use of a "skilled and trained workforce, and consistency with objective development standards. The law will apply only if it is shown in a housing production report (the first reports are due April 1, 2018) that a city is not achieving affordable housing targets. The law requires a local government to notify the development proponent in writing within 90 days of submittal (for projects of more than 150 units) if the local government determines that the development conflicts with any of those objective standards; otherwise, the development is deemed to comply with those standards. Design review or other public oversight of the development may still be conducted but is directed to the "objective and be strictly focused on assessing compliance with criteria required for streamlined projects, as well as reasonable objectives design standards published and adopted by ordinance or resolution by a local jurisdiction before submission of a development application, and shall be broadly applicable to development within that jurisdiction." The design review or public oversight process must be completed within 180 days (for projects of more than 150 units) of submittal of the development.
b) Limitations on Local Government Imposition of Parking or Other Requirements for Qualifying Projects . The law limits the authority of a local government to impose parking standards on a streamlined development approved. The law also prohibits a local government from adopting any requirement that applies to a project solely or partially on the basis that the project receives ministerial or streamlined approval pursuant to SB 35.
c) Limitations on Approval Expiration . The law provides that if a local government approves a project pursuant to that process, that approval will not expire if that project includes investment in housing affordability where more than 50 percent of units are affordable. The approval of a project that contains less than 50 percent affordable units expires automatically after three years, unless that project qualifies for a one-time, oneyear extension of that approval. Separately, the law provides that an approval shall remain valid for three years from the date of the final action establishing that approval and shall remain valid thereafter so long as vertical construction of the development has begun and is in progress; it also authorizes a discretionary one-year extension.
d) Local Government Housing Production Reporting. The law also requires local governments to include in the annual general plan report specified information regarding units of net new housing, including rental housing and for-sale housing that have been issued a completed entitlement, building permit or certificate of occupancy. The law also requires local governments to report on the housing produced pursuant to SB 35's requirements.
4. SB 540 (Roth) Workforce Housing Opportunity Zones. This law streamlines the environmental review and planning process for certain housing projects located within to-beestablished "Workforce Housing Opportunity Zones" and meeting affordable housing, prevailing wage and other specified criteria.
a) Workforce Housing Opportunity Zone Planning and Environmental Review. The law encourages local agencies to prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and adopt a specific plan. A local government may submit an application to HCD for funding to support the local government's efforts to develop a specific plan and EIR within a Workforce Housing Opportunity Zone.
b) Streamlining for Compliant Housing Project Processing. Housing projects meeting certain criteria (including providing affordable housing and paying prevailing wages), would not require a separate CEQA review, and the local jurisdiction would be required to take action on such projects within 60 days after an application is deemed complete.
5. AB 73 (Chiu) Housing Sustainability Districts. This law gives local governments incentives to create housing in "Housing Sustainability Districts" on infill sites near public transportation.
a) Creation of Housing Sustainability Districts. The law prescribes the contents of the ordinance that must be established to create a Housing Sustainability District, including the obligation to require that at least 20 percent of the residential units constructed within the district are affordable. The law requires the agency to prepare an EIR when designating a Housing Sustainability District. However an EIR is not required if, when reviewing a housing project, the agency has certified an EIR within 10 years of the lead agency's review of a housing project.
b) Zoning Incentive Payment for Compliant Housing Sustainability Districts . The law requires HCD to approve a zoning incentive payment for those agencies that apply for such payment if its housing sustainability ordinance meets the specified requirements and the city's housing element is in compliance with specified law. The law requires HCD to issue a certificate of compliance if the agency meets specified criteria pertaining to the continued compliance.
c) Streamlining Compliant Housing Project Processing . The law authorizes a developer to develop a project in a Housing Sustainability District in accordance with the housing sustainability ordinance or the agency's otherwise applicable general plan and zoning ordinances. The law imposes deadlines for an agency's processing of a project within a Housing Sustainability District and limits the instances in which an approving authority may deny a qualifying project.
Notably, the law requires that prevailing wages be paid and a skilled workforce be employed in connection with all projects within the Housing Sustainability District. The law establishes procedures for review of an application by an approving authority, including requiring the approving authority to conduct a public hearing on an application and issue a written decision within 120 days of receipt of the application. The law also prescribes procedures for review of a decision of the approving authority to deny or approve with conditions an application for a permit within a Housing Sustainability District in the appropriate superior court.
d) HCD Obligation to Prepare Housing Sustainability District Program Report . The law requires HCD to publish a report containing specified information about the Housing Sustainability District program on its website no later than Nov. 1, 2018, and each Nov. 1 thereafter.
III. Housing Element Law Amendments
6. SB 166 (Skinner) Residential Density. Existing "no net loss" in zoning density law requires that local governments identify adequate sites to meet regional housing needs when a housing element is adopted. This new law bolsters existing law to ensure that agencies maintain an ongoing supply of housing construction sites for residents of various income levels, throughout the entirety of a housing element planning period.
a) Prohibitions on Reducing Density. Specifically, the law prohibits an agency from reducing residential density to a density that is below the density utilized by HCD in determining compliance with housing element law unless the agency makes findings that the reduction is consistent with the general plan and that the remaining sites identified in the housing element are adequate to meet the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need. It also prohibits local agencies from causing their inventories of housing sites to be insufficient to meet their required housing needs for lower-income and moderate-income households. The law also requires agencies to make specified written findings if the agency allows development of any parcel with fewer units by income category than identified in the housing element for that parcel. If the approval of a development project results in fewer units by income category than identified in the housing element for that parcel and the remaining sites in the housing elements are not adequate to accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need by income level, the agency must then identify additional adequate sites within 180 days.
7. AB 1397 (Low) Residential Development Inventory. Existing law requires an agency's housing element to contain an inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having the potential for redevelopment. The new law strengthens housing element law by limiting the reliance of local governments on sites that do not have a realistic capacity for development of housing.
a) Modified Analysis of Land for Residential Development . Specifically, the new law makes changes to the definition of land suitable for residential development to increase the number of sites where new multifamily housing can be built. Specifically, the law requires the inventory of land to be available for residential development in addition to being suitable for residential development and to include vacant sites and sites that have "realistic and demonstrated potential for redevelopment during the planning period to meet the locality's housing need for a designated income level."
b) Local Agency Obligation to Consider Infrastructure and Resource Availability . The law also includes new requirements for requiring parcels included in the inventory to have sufficient water, sewer and dry utilities supply available, or be included in an existing general plan program or other mandatory program or plan to secure sufficient water, sewer and dry utilities supply to support housing development and to be accessible to support housing development. This law requires the agency to specify for each site the number of units that can realistically be accommodated on that site and whether the site is adequate to accommodate lower-income housing, moderate-income housing or abovemoderate-income housing.
c) Local Agency Obligation to Consider Local Experience in Housing Production. The new law requires the agency's discussion of the methodology used to determine development potential to consider, among other things, the city's or county's past experience with converting existing uses to higher-density residential development, the current demand for the existing use, and an analysis of existing leases or other contracts that would perpetuate the existing use or prevent redevelopment.
8. AB 879 (Grayson) Housing Production Reporting, Development Constraints Analysis and Local Fees Study. This law requires additional analysis of housing production and housing constraints in an agency's annual general plan report as well as an HCD-prepared study of local fees charged to new residential developments that will also include a proposal to substantially reduce such fees.
a) Local Agency Obligation to Report on Housing Production . Specifically, the law now requires an agency, as part of its annual general plan report, to report on the number of housing development applications received in the prior year, units approved and disapproved in the prior year, and a listing of sites rezoned to accommodate that portion of the city's or county's share of the regional housing need for each income level that could not be accommodated on specified sites. The law also extends the obligation to prepare the general plan report to charter cities.
b) Local Agency Obligation to Analyze Housing Constraints . The law also now requires an analysis of governmental constraints upon the maintenance or development of housing to also include any locally adopted ordinances that directly impact the cost and supply of residential development. The law requires the analysis of nongovernmental constraints to also include the requests to develop housing at densities below those anticipated in a specified analysis as well as the length of time between receiving approval for a housing development and submittal of an application for building permits for that housing development. The law requires the analysis of nongovernmental constraints to demonstrate local efforts to remove nongovernmental constraints that create a gap between the locality's planning for the development of housing for all income levels and the construction of that housing.
c) HCD Obligation to Prepare Local Fees Study and Recommend Means to Reduce Fees . This law also requires HCD, by June 30, 2019, to complete a study to evaluate the reasonableness of local fees charged to new developments. The law requires the study to include findings and recommendations regarding potential amendments to the California Mitigation Fee Act to substantially reduce fees for residential development.
IV. Funding
9. SB 2 (Atkins) Building Homes and Jobs Act. This law establishes a permanent funding source for affordable housing to fill the gap in funding lost from the loss of redevelopment agencies and the exhaustion of prior bond funds. Specifically, the law establishes funding through a $75 fee on real estate transaction documents. The fee is capped at $225 per transaction and exempts real estate sales. The fees would generate roughly $225 million per year, which would be split among state and local housing programs.
10. SB 3 (Beall) Veterans and Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018. This law authorizes $4 billion in general obligation bonds for affordable housing programs and a veteran's home ownership program. SB 3 must be approved by voters in November 2018.
V. Other
11. AB 1505 (Bloom/Bradford/Chiu/Gloria) "Palmer Fix." The law declares the legislative intent to supersede the holding and dicta in Palmer/Sixth Street Properties L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1396 (Palmer) to the extent that the decision conflicts with a local jurisdiction's authority to impose inclusionary housing requirements on rental housing.
a) Authorization of Inclusionary Housing Ordinances for Residential Rental Units . Specifically, this law authorizes cities and counties to adopt an inclusionary ordinance for residential rental units in order to create affordable housing.
b) HCD Review of Inclusionary Housing Ordinances . This law also authorizes HCD – within 10 years of the adoption or amendment of an inclusionary ordinance by a county or city after Sept. 15, 2017, requiring more than 15 percent of the total number of units rented in the development be affordable to, and occupied by, households at 80 percent or less of the area median income – to review that ordinance if the county or city fails to meet specified conditions (i.e., that the county or city has failed to meet at least 75 percent of its share of the regional housing need allocated or that the agency has failed to submit its annual general plan report). The law authorizes HCD to request – and require that the county or city provide – evidence that the ordinance does not unduly constrain the production of housing by submitting an economic feasibility study that meets specified standards.
c) Limitation on Inclusionary Housing Obligations if Not Economically Feasible . If HCD finds that the economic feasibility study does not meet specified standards, or if the county or city fails to submit the study within 180 days, the law would require the county or city to limit any requirement to provide rental units in a development affordable to households at 80 percent or less of the area median income to no more than 15 percent of the total number of units in the development.
12. AB 1521 (Bloom/Chiu) Preservation Notice Law Amendments. This law strengthens the Preservation Notice Law by requiring additional notice of a scheduled expiration of rental restrictions and by requiring owners of expiring affordable rental properties to accept any market-rate purchase offer from a qualified preservation entity that intends to maintain the property's affordability restrictions. The law requires HCD to monitor compliance and allows tenants the right to enforce the law. The law applies to an "assisted housing development," defined as a multifamily rental housing development that receives governmental assistance pursuant to specified federal or local programs. The granting of density bonuses, concessions or incentives is included as a type of local assistance that renders a project subject to the law. However, assisted housing developments in which 25 percent or less of the units are subject to affordability restrictions are exempt from the requirement to accept any market-rate purchase offer from a qualified preservation entity that intends to maintain the property's affordability restrictions.
13. AB 571 (E. Garcia) Farmworker Housing Tax Credits. This law makes it easier to develop farmworker housing by easing qualifications for the Farmworker Housing Tax Credit.

Posted; Thursday, January 18, 2018. 10:09 a.m. CST. By BBN Staff:Minister of State with responsibility for Public Service, Energy and Public Utilities Frank Mena is heading a delegation to the Eighth Session of the Assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), which commenced on January 13, 2018.
On Sunday, January 14, 2018, a bilateral meeting was held between the Delegation from Belize and the Government of the United Arab Emirates to announce the emPOWER Rural Electrification project (emPOWER Project).
The emPOWER Project aims to provide renewable energy solutions to assist Belize in achieving universal energy access.
This project plans to install 344 kW of solar PV and battery storage in rural villages that currently do not have access to the national electricity grid.
The villages selected are (Crique Sarco, Indian Creek, Gold Stream, and Medina Bank).
The project is estimated to cost US$2.736 million and is in alignment with Belize’s Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), which sets a goal of universal access to energy services by 2030.
The Government of Belize intends to install smart solar PV, battery storage, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) off-grid system and stand-alone solar PV systems (SAS) to remote communities to provide energy services and electricity.
The UAE announced the landmark $50 million grant fund for renewable energy projects in the Caribbean, launched by Her Excellency Reem Al Hashimy, Minister of State for International Cooperation.
The UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund represents one of the largest-ever, single investments in the region’s clean energy sector, as well as a significant deepening of bilateral relationships between the UAE and Caribbean countries.
Belize was one of the seven Caribbean countries awarded grant funding for works to be commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in early 2019.
The other Caribbean countries eligible to tap into the UAE fund are Guyana, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia.
IRENA is an intergovernmental organization that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future and serves as the principal platform for international cooperation, a centre of excellence, and a repository of policy, technology, resource and financial knowledge on renewable energy.

Hide yo' kids, hide yo' wife...hide yo' brisket? Another local barbecue joint has fallen victim to the beef-stealing jackass we've dubbed the Brisket Bandit. This time, B & B Smokehouse at 2627 Pleasanton, was broken into last Friday, January 31.General Manager Catherine Lopez was the first to notice the burglary, who discovered the Brisket Bandit had made away with more than 200 pounds of brisket halfway through the smoking process."The footage shows it happened at around 3:20 a.m., but you can only see a shadow," Lopez said of the break-in, where the BB cut into their fenced in enclosure and picked the lock. B & B Smokehouse has upgraded their camera system and changed their locks. The Austin Chronicle first connected the break-ins: Conger's Smoke Shack was also hit in early January, a Jason Dady's Two Bros. BBQ Market lost $2,500 worth of product in the early hours of January 16.As NPR'sreported in late January, brisket prices are up 60 percent from last year, so we can speculate that this is a) not going to stop any time soon; b) there seems to be an underlying connection as the guy knows his way around the pits; c) someone somewhere is selling a whole lot of black market brisket; and d) local barbecue joints would do well to beef up security (pun very much so intended), like, yesterday.

Animals
Adult male CD1 mice (8–10 weeks old upon arrival) used in this study were obtained from Laboratory Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Animals were housed with food and water available ad libitum and kept in controlled room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity (60–80%) under a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. All the behavioral tests were done in blind respect to the drug treatment. All experimental procedures and animal handing were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain and the animal protocols were approved by Soochow University Animal Committee. The authors tried all efforts to minimize the number of animals used.
Drugs and administration
We purchased NaHS, Na 2 S, GYY4137, compound 48/80, chloroquine, Resiniferatoxin (RTX), chlorpheniramine maleate, and capsaicin from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Zinc chloride was obtained from China Sinopharm Chemical Reagent CO.,Ltd (Shanghai, China), and ascorbic acid was obtained from China Shanghai Xiandai Hasen (Shangqiu) Pharmaceutical CO.,Ltd (Shanghai, China). Naloxone hydrochloride was obtained from China National Medicines Guorui Pharmaceutical CO.,Ltd (Huainan City, Anhui Province, China). Mibefradil dihydrochloride, capsazepine and HC-030031 was obtained from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Morphine hydrochloride was obtained from China Northeast Pharmaceutical Group Shenyang No.1 Pharmaceytical CO., Ltd (Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, China). lidocaine(2%) was obtained from China Otsuka Pharmaceytical CO.,Ltd (Tianjin, China). Capsaicin, Resiniferatoxin (RTX), capsazepine, mibefradil and HC-030031 were dissolved in 10% DMSO. Other reagents were dissolved in sterile saline if not specified.
Selective Ca v 3.2 siRNA (sc-42707) and scrambled Ca v 3.2 control siRNA (sc-37007) were synthesized by Santa Cruz (Shanghai, China). siRNA was dissolved in RNase-free water at the concentration of 1 μg/μl as stock solution, and mixed with polyethyleneimine (PEI, Fermentas) (Shanghai, China), 10 min before injection, to increase cell membrane penetration and reduce the degradation. PEI was dissolved in 5% glucose, and 1 μg of siRNA was mixed with 0.18 μl of PEI. We intrathecally injected 10 μl of siRNA (2 μg) once a day for 2 days to knockdown Ca v 3.2 expression. Intrathecal injection was performed by a lumbar puncture to deliver reagent into cerebral spinal fluid. A successful spinal puncture was evidenced by a brisk tail-flick after the needle entry into subarachnoid space22. Capsaicin (10 μg in 20 μl 2.5% DMSO) or NaHS (200 μg in 20 μl saline) was intraplantarly injected into one hindpaw, and the number of flinches was counted for the first 10 min.
Neck model of itch
As described previously23, mice were shaved at the nape of the neck at least 2 day before experiments. On the day of behavioral testing, mice were individually placed in small plastic chambers (10 × 10 × 12.5 cm) on an elevated metal mesh floor and allowed at least 30 min for habituation. Under brief anesthesia of isoflurane, mice were given an intradermal injection of 50 μl of agents via a 26G needle into the nape of the neck. Immediately after the injection, mice were returned to their chambers and were video recorded for 30 min. The video was subsequently played back offline and itch behavior was quantified by counting the number of scratches in a blinded manner. A scratch was counted when a mouse lifted its hindpaw to scratch the shaved region and returned the paw to the floor or to the mouth for licking.
Cheek model of itch
To distinguish itch and pain behavior, we used the cheek model by injection of chemicals into the cheek of mice. Mice were shaved on cheeks (approx. 5 × 8 mm area) at least 2 day before the experiment. On the day of experiment, mice were intradermally injected of 20 μl of reagent (NaHS or Na 2 S) via a 26G needle into the cheek under brief anesthesia with isoflurane. Immediately after the injection, mice were returned to their chambers and were video recorded for 30 min. The video was played back and the number of wipes and scratches were quantified by counting their number. One wipe was defined when mouse unilaterally wipes the injected site with the forelimb, which was not part of grooming behavior. One scratch was defined as a lifting of the hind paw toward the injection site on the cheek and then returning the paw to the floor or to the mouth.
Alloknesis assay
According to a previous report24, alloknesis after intradermal injection of pruritogens was evaluated. Briefly, 30 min after the injection of NaHS or Na 2 S, a von Frey filament (0.7 mN) was applied to the affected skin site. A scratch bout directed to the site of mechanical stimulation was considered as a positive response. The alloknesis score was determined by calculating the total number of scratches elicited by three mechanical stimuli and was evaluated at 5-min intervals.
Tail immersion test
As previously described25, tail immersion test was employed to assess heat pain sensitivity in mice. Briefly, the terminal 3 cm of a mouse’s tail was immersed in hot water bath at 52 °C and the latency of tail flick was recorded with a cutoff time of 10 seconds to avoid potential tissue injury.
Rotarod test
The mouse motor function was tested using DXP-2 Rota-Rod equipment (Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences). Each mouse was trained for two consecutive days (6 trails per day) where the speed of the rotor was accelerated from 4 to 25 rpm with an acceleration of 0.2 rpm/sec. One day after the last training session, the mouse was tested at the speed of the rotor (25 rpm) for three times and the longest duration of running time was recorded.
Pharmacological treatments
To test the possible effects of μ-opioid receptor agonist or antagonist on H 2 S donors-induced scratching, μ-opioid receptor agonist morphine (1 mg/kg) or antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg) was i.p. injected into mice 20 min before i.d. injection of 200 μg NaHS or Na 2 S in mice. To assess the possible effects of antihistamine on H 2 S donors-induced scratching behavior, chlorpheniramine (10 mg/kg), the selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist, was i.p. injected 20 min before i.d. injection of NaHS or Na 2 S in mice. To examine the role of mast cells in the H 2 S donors-induced itch, we deplete mast cells by daily treatment with compound 48/80 (1, 3, 10 and 10 μg per site on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th days, respectively) before injection of NaHS. As we described previously23, to examine the role of TRPV1-expressing C-fibers in the H 2 S donors-induced itch, we destroyed these C-fibers by daily treatment with the ultra-potent TRPV1 receptor agonist resiniferatoxin (RTX, 30, 70 and 100 μg/kg, subcutaneously for 3 consecutive days), one week before injection of H 2 S donors. Intradermal injection of lidocaine (2%) was also used for testing the possible role of A-fibers in H 2 S donors-induced scratching in both vehicle and RTX-treated mice26. To assess the involvement of TRPV1 or TRPA1 in H 2 S donors-induced scratching behavior, capsazepine (10–50 μg; the selective TRPV1 antagonist) or HC-030031 (10–50 μg; the selective TRPA1 antagonist) was intradermally co-administrated with NaHS. To assess the involvement of Ca v 3.2 T-type calcium channel in NaHS-induced scratching behavior, mibefradil (i.d. 5–25 nmol; T-type calcium channel blocker), ascorbic acid (i.d. 1 nmol; i.p. 1 mg/kg; selective Ca v 3.2 blocker) or zinc chloride (i.d. 5 nmol; i.p. 1 mg/kg; selective Ca v 3.2 blocker) were administrated. The doses chosen for inhibition experiments were based on previous reports and our pilot experiments.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
We collected cervical DRGs and spinal cord, isolated total RNAs using RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed for each sample using Omniscript reverse transcriptase according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen). Q-RT-PCR sequences for Ca v 3.2: forward: TCTCGCTACCCAATGACAGC; reverse: CTCCGTGTAGTCTGGGATGC; Ca v 3.1: forward: ACATTGGAGCAGCCTCTTCAG; reverse: CTGCTGGTTGGGAGTGAACA. Triplicate qPCR analyses were performed using the SYBR Green master mix (KAPA) and Opticon real-time PCR Detection System (ABI Life7500) as described previously27.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were terminally anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused through the ascending aorta with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The L4-6 lumbar spinal cords were collected and postfixed in the same fixative overnight. The spinal cord sections were cut at the thickness of 14-μm in a cryostat. The tissue sections were blocked with 10% goat serum, and incubated over night at 4oC with the primary antibodies guinea pig anti-TRPV1 antibody (1:1000, Neuromics) (Edina, MN, USA). The sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch. West Grove, PA, USA). Immunostained tissue sections were examined under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope AXIO SCOPE A1 (Oberkochen, Germany), and images were analyzed with NIH Image software or Adobe PhotoShop.
Western blotting
Mice were terminally anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS, and the DRGs were rapidly removed and homogenized in a lysis buffer containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors for total protein extraction and assay according to our previous report28. The protein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), and 25 μg of proteins were loaded for each lane and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After the transfer, the blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST and PVDF membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary polyclonal antibody against Ca v 3.2 (goat, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For loading control, the blots were probed with Tubulin antibody (mouse, 1:1000, Vazyme, Suzhou City Jiangsu Province, China). The blots were washed and incubated in horseradish peroxidase–conjugated donkey anti-goat or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) and the band densities were detected and analyzed using Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS + System (Bio-Rad, Shanghai, China). Data from five mice were used for statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis
All values were presented as the mean ± S.E.M. Student’s t test was used for two group comparison. One-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Bonferroni test was used for multiple comparisons. Two-way repeated-measured ANOVA was also used to analyze the data with multiple time points. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered as statistical significance.

TODAY IS NOLLAIG na mBan, also known as Women’s Christmas, Little Christmas and the Feast of the Epiphany.
The religious feast marks the day the three kinds are said to have arrived at the stable in Bethlehem to visit the baby Jesus.
This is also, in Ireland, the day on which you’re supposed to take all your Christmas decorations down – something that is particularly strictly adhered to in rural parts of the country.
However, the translation of the Irish name means Women’s Christmas and it has long been recognised as a day for celebrating the contribution of Irish women to society.
Originally, it was considered as a kind of day of rest for women after the Christmas rush and they would often gather together in a pub or one of their homes to chill out away from the children for a few hours.
The men would stay at home to mind the little ones and do the chores to give them a well-deserved break.
Though we have moved on considerably from a time when women were (figuratively) chained to the kitchen counter throughout the festive period, the tradition lives on.
All across the country Irish ladies still meet up with their female friends and relatives to celebrate their own mini Christmas, with a few tipples for those who have not decided to go dry for January.

Li 2 MSiO 4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co) have been the subject of intensive studies as promising Li storage materials because of their high potential capacities, low cost, environmental friendliness and excellent safety characteristics1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Realizing a two electron exchange per formula in orthosilicates leads to higher capacities (e.g. ~331 mAh/g for Li 2 FeSiO 4 ) than the olivine phosphates where there is only one Li atom per formula unit2,3. In the last decade, much effort has been devoted to the study of different Li 2 MSiO 4 polymorphs. However, it was reported that Li 2 FeSiO 4 exhibits a reversible capacity of only 130 ~ 165 mAh/g1,4,5 or high initial charge capacities (~240 mAh/g) with noticeable decay in the following cycles6,7, while both Li 2 MnSiO 4 2,8,9,10 and Li 2 CoSiO 4 11 show more than one electron exchange in the first charge cycle but suffer from poor rate capability and drastic capacity fade.
In comparison with the Li compounds, much less experimental work was carried out to investigate the orthosilicates as Na host matrix. The chemical similarities between Na and Li imply that exploration of the sodium equivalent offer more opportunities to advance energy storage technology through rechargeable batteries, owing to the even lower cost and ubiquitous availability of Na. Recently20, Na 2 MnSiO 4 was synthesized and investigated for use as a positive electrode material for Na secondary batteries. A reversible capacity of 125 mAh/g was found compared with the theoretical capacity of 278 mAh/g based on the two electron reaction.
The discrepancy between measured and calculated capacities has been attributed to the instability of the crystal structures upon delithiation/desodiation3,12,13,20. In order to circumvent the capacity fading and further improve the electrochemical properties, it is essential to understand their crystal structures and explore other possible polymorphs that may be stable in the delithiated/desodiated state.
Experimental data indicate that the crystal structures of the orthosilicate compounds A 2 MSiO 4 (A = Li, Na; M = Mn, Fe, Co) belong to a family of tetrahedral structures that exhibit a rich polymorphism21,22. Polymorphs of these tetrahedral structures were classified into low- and high-temperature forms, which differ in the distribution of cations within tetrahedral sites of a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) based arrangement of oxygen. Five different structures were observed and studied for Li 2 FeSiO 4 1,4,5,14,15,16, three as-synthesized (two are orthorhombic, Pmnb and Pmn2 1 ; one is monoclinic, P2 1 /n) and two cycled phases (Pmn2 1 -cycled and P2 1 /n-cycled). Likewise, multiple phases have been reported for Li 2 MnSiO 4 (Pmn2 1 2, Pn12, P2 1 /n17 and Pmnb9) and Li 2 CoSiO 4 (Pnb2 1 18, Pmn2 1 11,18, and P2 1 /n18). The recent work of Na 2 MnSiO 4 20 showed that Na 2 MnSiO 4 has a monoclinic structure with space group Pn.
In the above reported structures of A 2 MSiO 4 , all the atoms form tetrahedral units, i.e. every atom is in the center of a tetrahedron and has a coordination number of 4. Taking advantage of this structural feature, we used a fast motif-network scheme based on genetic algorithm (GA)23 to explore the complex crystal structures of these materials. Our results provide a more comprehensive tetrahedral structure database to assist future effort on the study of delithiation/desodiation process.
Although systematic enumerations of 4-connected crystalline networks have been applied to zeolites and other silicates24,25,26, considering the great effort of selecting energetically preferable structures out of millions of possible configurations owing to the lack of decent classical potentials for A 2 MSiO 4 , here we took a different route to obtain tetrahedral networks from the low-energy crystal structures of silicon. Silicon is well known to have rich phases and forms sp3-hybridized framework structures27. We used GA and Tersoff potential28 to search for silicon structures that form tetrahedral networks. Once such a silicon structure was located, all the sites were re-assigned to A (Li or Na), M (Mn, Fe or Co), Si and O atoms in the ratio of 2:1:1:4. During the substitution, only structures where every oxygen atom bonds with two A atoms, one M atom and one Si atom, as illustrated in Fig. 1, were accepted. This is because of the observation that structures with uniformly distributed A, M and Si atoms have noticeably lower energies. Newly generated structures that had not been visited were collected for further refinement by first-principles calculations. In this way, various A 2 MSiO 4 structures were obtained. More details on the first-principles calculations can be found in the methods section.
Figure 1: Schematic representation of the structure generations. The A 2 MSiO 4 structures are generated from tetrahedral networks, where A = Li or Na; M = Mn, Fe or Co. For a given tetrahedral network, once one of its sites (e.g. the center of the tetrahedron) is assigned to oxygen, its four neighbors are randomly assigned to two A atoms, one M atom and one Si atom. Then, neighbors of A, M and Si are only assigned to oxygen atoms. In such an iterative manner, the occupations of all sites are determined. The oxygen-centered tetrahedron is shown by red, transparent planes. Full size image
Generation of the tetrahedral networks costs very little time due to the usage of classical potentials during the GA searches. In this work, up to 48 atoms in the unit cell were searched for Si to find tetrahedral networks, i.e. up to 6 formula units were considered for A 2 MSiO 4 . In order to obtain as many tetrahedral networks as possible, energies of the silicon structures that satisfy the coordination constraints (every atom in the structure has a coordination number of 4) were lowered by a pre-set amount to increase their chance of survival.
Results of the A 2 MSiO 4 structures from current study are summarized in Fig. 2, where the relative energies are plotted by setting the energy of the ground state structure to 0 eV for each system. We found that the structures of A 2 MSiO 4 are highly degenerate in energy, in agreement with the rich crystal chemistry observed in experiments. Using our method, in addition to the structures previously reported in the literature (shown in red color in Fig. 2a) and structures included in the Materials Project database29, many more structures with competitive or even lower energies were found. Within the energy windows plotted in Fig. 2a, less than 10 structures were included in the Materials Project database for each Li system and none for the Na systems, while more than 30 structures are shown in Fig. 2a for each system. We classified those low-energy structures into three different types based on the frameworks formed by M, Si and O atoms13,15, i.e. the structures with 1D/2D/3D M-Si-O framework.

Abstract Three-dimensional ultrasound is a powerful imaging technique, but it requires thousands of sensors and complex hardware. Very recently, the discovery of compressive sensing has shown that the signal structure can be exploited to reduce the burden posed by traditional sensing requirements. In this spirit, we have designed a simple ultrasound imaging device that can perform three-dimensional imaging using just a single ultrasound sensor. Our device makes a compressed measurement of the spatial ultrasound field using a plastic aperture mask placed in front of the ultrasound sensor. The aperture mask ensures that every pixel in the image is uniquely identifiable in the compressed measurement. We demonstrate that this device can successfully image two structured objects placed in water. The need for just one sensor instead of thousands paves the way for cheaper, faster, simpler, and smaller sensing devices and possible new clinical applications.
INTRODUCTION Ultrasound imaging is a widely used technique in medical decision-making, mainly due to the fact that ultrasound devices use nonionizing radiation and are relatively low-cost. By carefully aiming the transducer, the operator can use ultrasound to obtain real-time images of specific cross sections of the body. The contrast in ultrasound images is due to sound speed and density differences between tissues. This is why, for example, a baby’s skull in a watery womb forms a clear picture in ultrasound imaging. Almost all ultrasound images are made with transducers composed of many tiny sensors (between 64 and 10,000) that can transmit short ultrasonic bursts (typically 1 to 40 MHz). These bursts are then reflected by the tissue and recorded by the same sensor array. The time delay between transmission of the burst and detection of the echoes defines where the tissue is located. The strength of the reflected echo contains information on the density of the tissue. The sensors that make up these arrays are made mainly from piezoelectric crystals. When a voltage is applied to the material, the crystal vibrates and produces a short ultrasonic burst of a few cycles (1). When the sensors are activated with appropriate delays, the emitted ultrasound wave travels along a straight line (in the form of a narrow beam) and can be focused on a point of interest. With these focused beams, a whole volume can be scanned (Fig. 1A). In terms of receiving the signal reception, similar delays can be used to selectively enhance the signals from scatterers along the beam of interest. This type of focusing that uses delayed signals in transmitting and/or receiving is named beamforming and has been a source of active academic research for many years (2). One advantage of applying beamforming in receive mode is that it can be carried out digitally after the received ultrasound field has been recorded (Fig. 1B). An alternative technique applied in ultrasound imaging is to use an unfocused (“plane”) wave during transmission. The focus is then regained upon reception, allowing for a faster frame rate because the medium is not “scanned” line by line with a focused beam. Fig. 1 The three techniques of ultrasound imaging formation. Conventional ultrasound imaging requires an array of sensors to (A) focus the transmitted and received wave field or (B) only the received wave field by postprocessing the individual signals after analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). We propose using only one sensor without focusing in transmission or receive (C). The majority of ultrasound imaging is performed using transducer arrays that have their sensors distributed along one dimension (Fig. 1, A and B), thereby offering a two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional view of the inside of the human body. To obtain a full 3D view, one needs to mechanically move or rotate the 1D array or to create a 2D array that allows beam steering in two directions. These 2D arrays have been shown to produce stunning high-resolution 3D images, for example, of faces of fetuses (3, 4). However, 3D ultrasound imaging is a long way from achieving the popularity of 2D ultrasound imaging apart from in certain medical disciplines, such as obstetrics, cardiology, and image-guided intervention. This is surprising given that a full 3D view should in almost all cases allow for a better assessment of the specific medical question. One of the main reasons for this low acceptance of 3D ultrasound imaging is that 3D imaging requires a high hardware complexity (>1000 sensors on a small footprint, integrated electronics, high data rates, etc.). Most of this is necessary to cope with the constraints imposed by the Nyquist theorem when sampling the received radiofrequency ultrasound signals. Fortunately, as shown by recent discoveries in statistics (5–7), the classical idea that digitization of analog signals (such as ultrasound waves) demands uniform sampling at rates twice as high as the highest frequency present (known as the Nyquist theorem) is no longer a rule carved in stone. This discovery has opened up a very active field of research known as compressive sensing (CS) (8). One of the leading thoughts in CS is that signals generally contain some natural structure. This structure can be exploited to compress the signal to one that is many times smaller than the original, as is done, for example, in jpeg compression of images. However, until recently, this size reduction was always done after the signal had been acquired at full Nyquist rate. CS now allows the compression to be merged with the sensing. As an immediate consequence, the number of measurements required to recover the signal of interest can be drastically reduced, potentially leading to cheaper, faster, simpler, and smaller sensing devices. In the case of ultrasound imaging, this has already led to the development of successful new strategies for sampling and image reconstruction (9–12). One of the most striking implementations of CS has been the design of the single-pixel camera by Duarte et al. (13). Here, the authors managed to reconstruct images using an adjustable mirror mask and a single photodetector. By projecting the image onto the photodetector using random mask patterns, they were able to recover the actual image from a number of measurements much less than the number of image pixels, hence the name compressive imaging. This work has inspired many others to try and use the idea in a similar way for different applications (14–16), including within the ultrasound research community. Our work follows the concept central to compressive imaging: that of projecting the object/image information through a set of incoherent functions onto a single measurement. A successful strategy for obtaining these compressed measurements is to apply a so-called “coded aperture” (17–19). In this case, the information—whether it entails different light directions, different frequency bands, or any other information that is conventionally needed to build up an image—is coded into the available aperture and associated measurement. Smart algorithms are then needed to decode the retrieved measurements to form an image. Along these lines, here we introduce for the first time in ultrasound imaging a simple compressive imaging device that can create 3D images. Our device contains one large piezo sensor that transmits an ultrasonic wave through a simple plastic coding mask. Local variations in the mask thickness (Fig. 1C) cause local delays, which scrambles the phase of the wave field. Similar techniques were demonstrated by Melde et al. (20) and Brown et al. (21) to produce holograms that generate predefined (photo)acoustic fields. This enables a complex interference pattern to propagate inside the volume, removing ambiguity among echoes from different pixels, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The interference pattern propagates through the medium, scatters from objects within the medium, and then propagates back through the coding mask onto the same ultrasound sensor, providing a single compressed ultrasound measurement of the object. Fig. 2 A spatiotemporally varying ultrasound field allows for compressive imaging. (A) One sensor (transmitter and receiver) cannot distinguish between two objects when the transmitted wave field has no spatiotemporal diversity. (B) A simple coding mask can introduce a spatiotemporally varying wave field, which allows unique signal separation between two objects. Using our device, we aim to mitigate the hardware complexity associated with conventional 3D ultrasound. The manufacturing costs of our device will be much lower. A simple, cheap, single-element transducer is used, and the plastic coding mask can be produced for less than a euro. These lower costs enable broader use of these 3D compressive imaging devices, for example, for long-term patient monitoring. Because the imaging is 3D, finding and maintaining the proper 2D view does not require a trained operator. One could also envision other applications, such as minimally invasive imaging catheters that are too thin to accommodate the hundreds or thousands of electrical wires currently needed for 3D ultrasound imaging. Here, we discuss this new imaging concept and demonstrate experimentally that a simple setup with a coding mask allows for 3D ultrasound imaging—thereby paving the way for an entirely new method of imaging in which the complexity is shifted away from the hardware and toward computing power.
RESULTS Ultrasound wave field diversity using a coded aperture For single-sensor compressive imaging, the 3D object information needs to be projected onto a set of incoherent basis functions via a coded aperture. This is accomplished by breaking the phase uniformity of the ultrasound wave in both transmission and reception. Conventionally, the loss of phase uniformity (for example, through aberration) is unwanted because it leads to blurring and artifacts in the image. In our case, however, the pattern of this interference is known and is used to our benefit. The coding mask placed in front of the ultrasound sensor consists of a plastic material that supports ultrasound propagation with a speed of around 2750 m/s, in contrast to the speed in water, which is 1480 m/s at room temperature. Varying the mask thickness consequently varies the time the ultrasound wave spends within the plastic before entering the medium, in our case water. For an ultrasound wave with a central frequency of 5 MHz to be delayed by a full wavelength with respect to the rest of the wave requires a local thickness increase of 641 μm. When the thickness of the plastic varies spatially, the phase uniformity of the propagating wave is broken, initiating a random deterministic interference pattern in the medium. The mask covers the complete aperture of the sensor (diameter, 12.7 mm), and the thickness randomly varies between 0.1 and 1 mm. For more details, see the Materials and Methods section. It is important to note that the mask generates an interference pattern that essentially stretches in four dimensions (three spatial and one temporal). So for every location in 3D space (every pixel), we have one unique ultrasound signal that originates from that location. Figure 3 and movie S1 show how the natural focusing of the ultrasound sensor is altered after we place our coding mask in front of the sensor. Fig. 3 A random delay coding mask breaks the phase uniformity of the ultrasound transmission to enable compressive imaging. The top panel shows the ultrasound field transmitted from a normal piezoelectric sensor recorded by a small microphone (hydrophone) in front of the sensor. Note that the transmitted wave focuses naturally into a narrower bundle after propagation. The bottom panel shows the same transmitted wave field after propagation through the plastic coding mask. Here, the phase uniformity of the wave is completely lost. The images in (A) and (D) show one time sample (at 8.75 μs) of the transmitted wave field in a 2D plane (12.7 mm away from the sensor surface) perpendicular to the propagation axis, before and after the addition of the coding mask. The images in (B) and (E) show a projection of the total ultrasound energy over time in the same 2D plane that is used for (A) and (D). The images (C) and (F) show the energy projection over time in a 2D plane parallel to the ultrasound propagation axis. After excitation with a short high-voltage pulse, the piezo sensor used to insonify the medium produces a short ultrasound burst. Although short, the limited bandwidth ensures the burst has a certain length (time) and contains several (positive-negative) cycles. After propagating through the mask, the pulse length increases further due to the distortion of the wavefront by the coding mask (Fig. 4A). These waves will propagate spherically in the medium and will interfere constructively and destructively, a process that stretches out longer in time than an undistorted wavefront does. Consequently, the available spatial bandwidth increases compared to an undistorted burst by a mask-less sensor. This effect is highlighted in Fig. 4B, which shows two spatial frequency spectra: one at the beginning of the pulse and one spectrum a few microseconds later. Here, we assume that most of the acoustic energy is directly transmitted through the coding mask; yet, in reality, some of the energy will be reflected back from the mask-water interface and possibly redirected in the medium through the mask in a second pass after bouncing back from the mask-transducer interface, thereby increasing the spatial variability even more. Fig. 4 Spatiotemporal diversity as well as wave field rotation provides a unique signal for every pixel. (A) A 2D slice (time and y dimension) of the 4D ultrasound field (time and three spatial dimensions), where x = 0 and z = 12.7 mm. Every time sample of this 4D wave field has unique spatial properties, as is shown in (B) and (C). (B) The spatial ultrasound field at a later point in time contains higher spatial frequencies, which is desirable for reconstructing objects with high resolution. The possibility of rotating the mask offers another dimension of signal variation to be used for image reconstruction. (C) Analysis of two samples based on their spatial properties with respect to coding mask rotation. For pixels further away from the center, the local variance is higher than for pixels closer to the center. Any ultrasound imaging problem requires information about the spatial ultrasound field, typically acquired by array sampling. By modeling the aperture mask as a collection of point sensors, each having different transmit/receive delays, the mask can still be regarded as a sensor array. However, all these point sensor signals are subsequently summed by the piezo sensor just after they have passed though the mask, resulting in a single compressed measurement, as depicted in the right panel of Fig. 1 (for a further comparison between a sensor array and a single sensor with a coding mask, see text S2 and figs. S1 and S2). The delays produced by the mask create complex spatiotemporal interference patterns that ensure that each pixel generates a unique temporal signal in the compressed measurement. This unique pixel signature enables direct imaging without the need for uncompressed spatial measurements. Because of the limitations in temporal bandwidth, as well as in mask thickness distribution, it is not guaranteed that all pixel echo signals are uncorrelated. To introduce more diversity between the pixels, we chose to rotate the mask in front of the sensor such that the interference pattern is rotated along with it, thereby obtaining additional measurements containing new information. Mask translations (in x, y, or z dimension) would provide similar pixel diversity. Note that for a sufficiently good mask, mask rotation or translation is not necessarily required but significantly decreases interpixel correlations. The result on the ultrasound field as received by every pixel in one xy plane is depicted in Fig. 4C, where the effect of rotation in terms of temporal variety is shown at two points in time for three different pixels in the field of view. Pixel diversity If we model the ultrasound field of the coded aperture by approximating the mask aperture as a collection of point sources and sensors (see Materials and Methods section), we can analyze the coding performance of the aperture. To this end, we compute the pulse-echo signals for pixels in the central (xy plane) area at a fixed depth (z) relative to the sensor and then compute their cross-correlations. Ideally, all signals are uncorrelated, so that any superposition of pulse-echo signals can be uniquely broken down into its composing individual pulse-echo signals (as in Fig. 2), in which case the signals for each pixel can be unambiguously resolved. Figure 5B shows the histogram of interpixel correlations for a plane parallel to the sensor surface at a depth of 12.7 mm (aperture diameter size). We computed these correlations without a mask for several rotations. Because the wave field phase without using a mask is highly uniform, most pulse-echo signals are highly correlated. However, adding a mask to the single sensor causes the distribution to be zero-mean and removes the high correlations around +1 and −1. As expected, these results illustrate that adding more measurements by rotating the mask causes correlations to be distributed more narrowly around zero; pulse-echo signals become more orthogonal. This tells us that the use of rotation removes ambiguities and consequently increases resolvability of scatterers. Here, we do not include the signal correlations over the depth dimension, because generally speaking, the decorrelation in the acoustic propagation direction comes naturally with the pulse-echo delay, or in other words, using only one sensor, we can estimate the depth of an object, but we cannot see whether the object is located left or right from the sensor. Fig. 5 Random delays in the coding mask generate signal variability for unique pixel reconstruction. (A) Schematic drawing of the approximated ultrasound field in a plane inside the medium parallel to the sensor surface. For every pixel in this plane, we want the echo signals to be as uncorrelated/orthogonal as possible. (B) The histograms show the cross-correlation values of a large set of pixels in the plane, obtained using an approximate simulation model. When the plastic delay mask is rotated, the cross-correlation values distribute closer to zero, which suggests better image reconstruction. (C) Mask layout where the gray values indicate the thickness variations, causing local delays of the ultrasound field. (D) Local correlations for a pixel at a fixed (x, y) position at several depths using 72 mask rotations. (E) CRLB analysis. The leftmost panel shows the level curves for one SD of position estimation error for a depth z of 12.7 mm. The center graphs show the SD in x, y, and z over radius (distance to the center of rotation) at depth 12.7 mm, and over depth for a pixel at a distance of 3 mm from the center. The rightmost graph shows how the CRLB changes as more measurements are added by rotation for a pixel at a distance of 3 mm from the center and at a depth of 12.7 mm. Instead of looking at the pixel-pixel correlation in an entire xy imaging plane, we can also observe the local correlations. Such observations are demonstrated in Fig. 5D, which visualizes the correlations between the center pixel and all other local pixels. A higher correlation between pixels results in lower resolution due to their increased ambiguity. These figures show that the resolution in x and y worsens as the depth increases and that the resolution in z is better than that in xy, which is often the case for ultrasound imaging. For a more detailed analysis, we can also use the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and apply it in the aforementioned approximate model (22). The CRLB is a bound on the best attainable estimation variance for any unbiased estimator (for example, the estimated parameter can be the image itself). That is, the CRLB is related to the average squared estimation error. Hence, a lower CRLB suggests that the best obtainable resolution is lower as well. The actual estimator (beamformer) used in this paper is described in the next section and does not necessarily achieve the CRLB. Consequently, the error covariance of the actual estimator is typically greater than the CRLB, but the CRLB is a good measure to study trends in the resolution. The CRLB is derived for the case of estimating the position of a single scatterer given a pulse-echo measurement with additive Gaussian noise (see the Materials and Methods section for more details). For a 3D problem, this results in estimating three unknowns (x, y, and z coordinates) from N measurements, where N is the total number of samples. Although position estimation and imaging are not the same, one could argue that the best value obtained for positional error spread (for example, 3 SD of error) nevertheless is indicative for the achievable imaging resolution. To analyze the behavior and performance of the mask, we compute the CRLB for several points in 3D space, comparing the bounds for measurements obtained with no and four rotations (Fig. 5E). We distinguish two main factors that contribute to the CRLB. First, rotation of the mask significantly reduces the CRLB, and a very large performance gain is obtained by using more than one rotation. This effect is apparent when comparing the CRLB for several rotations in the graphs in Fig. 5E. Second, when we analyze the CRLB for no rotation, we see that the geometry of the problem determines the performance, which is visible in the second panel in Fig. 5E. That is, the performance for a small radial distance is dependent on the specific mask layout and worsens as the received energy decreases inversely proportional to the distance from the sensor. For computing the CRLB graphs, we used a constant noise energy such that the signal-to-noise ratio of a pixel at (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 12.7 mm) is equal to 10 dB. Signal model and image reconstruction Because only one sensor is used, there is no possibility of applying standard beamforming techniques typically used in conjunction with sensor arrays. These techniques mainly consider the geometry of the problem and do not require detailed information on the ultrasound transmission itself. In our case, it is essential that this detailed information is available because we only have one sensor observation. Thus, instead of applying a standard geometric operation to multiple sensor observations, we attempt to explain the received signal as a linear combination of point scatterer echo signals (23, 24). Without loss of generality, let us represent the unknown true image by a vector v, containing N pixels at a desired resolution. In our case, we use a pixel size smaller than two times the smallest wavelength detected (0.120 mm). We found that this discretization size was a good trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Furthermore, we assume that the data obtained by the measurement device are linearly related to the image v and can be modeled as where u is an M-dimensional vector containing the sampled pulse-echo signals, which are concatenated when using multiple rotations, such that M is equal to the number of time samples times the number of rotations. The M-dimensional vector n represents the additive noise. Note that in this model, the system matrix or so-called observation matrix H is determined by the measurement device (hardware) and contains all pulse-echo signals of all the pixels in v. For more details on the dimensions of H, a comparison to multisensor arrays, and the relation to CS, see text and figs. S2 and S3. Having defined u, H, and v, and assuming that a linear propagation and scattering model holds, imaging can be accomplished using a wide variety of linear inversion methods. To demonstrate the system, we imaged two plastic letters that were positioned at a distance of 17 and 23 mm away from the sensor. Here, H contained pulse-echo signals for all pixels within a 3D volume containing the scattering objects and was constructed using the calibration method discussed in the next section. As seen in Fig. 6 (B, D, and F), both letters were successfully reconstructed, demonstrating the 3D imaging capabilities of the presented methods. For Fig. 6 (B and D), we imaged a small volume containing each letter and applied regularized least squares inversion using the LSQR algorithm (25) with limited iterations to regularize the problem, which is known to be equivalent to a filtered singular value decomposition inversion (26). Fig. 6 Compressive 3D ultrasound imaging using a single sensor. (A) Schematic sketch of the signal model involved in this type of compressive imaging. Each column of the observation matrix H contains the ultrasound pulse-echo signal that is associated with a pixel in 3D space, which is contained in the image vector v. By rotating the coding mask in front of the sensor, we obtain new measurements that can be stacked as additional entries in the measurement vector u and additional rows in H. (B) Result of solving part of the image vector v using an iterative least squares technique. The two images are mean projections of six pixels along the z dimension [individual z slices shown in (D)]. (C) Schematic overview of the complete imaging setup. A single sensor transmits a phase uniform ultrasound wave through a coding mask that enables the object information (two plastic letters “E” and “D”) to be compressed to a single measurement. Rotation of the mask enables additional measurements of the same object. (D) Reconstruction of the letter “E” in six adjacent z slices. A small tilt of the letter (from top left corner to bottom right corner) can be observed, demonstrating the potential 3D imaging capabilities of the proposed device. (E) Image showing the two 3D-printed letters and the plastic coding mask with a rubber band for rotating the mask over the sensor. The two right-hand panels show close-ups of the plastic coding mask. (F) 3D rendering of the complete reconstructed image vector v, obtained by BPDN. The images shown in (B) and (D) were obtained using 72 evenly spaced mask rotations, and the full 3D image in (F) was obtained using only 50 evenly spaced rotations to reduce the total matrix size. For the full 3D reconstruction shown in Fig. 6F, we made use of the sparsity of these two letters in water by applying the sparsity-promoting basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) algorithm (27). As can be seen, this prior knowledge about the image could be effectively exploited to improve image quality, significantly improving the dynamic range from 15 to 40 dB. Unlike in CS reconstructions, sparsity is not necessary for linear inversion due to the local correlations of the encoding. However, sparsity can be exploited to improve the reconstruction as discussed in fig. S3. Constructing the system matrix H For computing the column signals of H, it is crucial to know the entire spatiotemporal wave field. To this end, we adopt a simple calibration measurement in which we spatially map the impulse signal (using a small hydrophone and a translation stage) in a plane close to the mask surface and perpendicular to the ultrasound propagation axis (Fig. 6C). This recorded wave field can then be propagated to any plane that is parallel to the recorded plane using the angular spectrum approach (28, 29). Note that this procedure is required only once and is unique for the specific sensor and coding mask. According to the reciprocity theorem, we are able to obtain the pulse-echo signal by performing an autoconvolution of the propagated hydrophone signal with itself (30). Using these components, we can then compute the pulse-echo ultrasound signal for every point in 3D space and subsequently populate the columns of H. The additional rotation of the coding mask can be regarded as a rotation of the ultrasound field inside the medium. Because every rotation provides a new measurement of the same image v, we can make use of this information by stacking these new signals as additional rows in the matrix H. The more independent rows we add to H, the better conditioned our image reconstruction problem becomes. More formally, let u i denote the ith sampled pulse-echo signal of length K, where K is the number of temporal samples obtained from one pulse-echo measurement and i indexes the various measurements obtained from different rotation angles. Let H i denote the measurement matrix for rotation i of size K × N, where N is the number of pixels. Then, if R rotations are performed, u and H are defined as follows: and , where u is length M, with M = KR, and H has size M × N. Furthermore, because each H i is obtained by propagating and rotating the same calibration measurement (see “Acoustic calibration procedure” section in the Materials and Methods), each H i can be computed from a reference measurement matrix : , where φ i is the angle of rotation corresponding to measurement i, and the function f(H, φ i ) computes the matrix H i from the reference matrix and input angle φ i by appropriately rotating the acoustic field implicitly stored in . Consequently, H is expressed as .
DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that compressive 3D ultrasound imaging can be successfully performed using just a single sensor and a simple aperture coding mask, instead of the thousand or more sensors conventionally required. The plastic mask breaks the phase uniformity of the ultrasound field and causes every pixel to be uniquely identifiable within the received signal. The compressed measurement contains the superimposed signals from all object pixels. The objects can be resolved using a regularized least squares algorithm, as we have proved here by successfully imaging two letters (“E” and “D”). Furthermore, we have provided an in-depth analysis of the qualities of our coding aperture mask for compressive ultrasound imaging. We believe that this technique will pave the way for an entirely new means of imaging in which the complexity is shifted away from the hardware side and toward the power of computing. The calibration procedure that we use and our imaging device both share common ideas with the time-reversal work conducted by Fink and co-workers (30–34). Time-reversal ultrasound entails the notion that any ultrasound field can be focused back to its source by re-emitting the recorded signal back into the same medium. Consequently, the ultrasonic waves can be focused onto a particular point in space and time if the impulse signal of that point is known. Using a reverberant cavity to create impulse signal diversity and a limited number of sensors, Fink et al. have shown that a 3D medium can be imaged by applying transmit focusing with respect to every spatial location. Hence, they need as many measurements as there are pixels, resulting in an unrealistic scenario for real-time imaging. Our work differs in the fact that rather than focusing our ultrasound waves to a single point, we encode the whole 3D volume onto one spatiotemporal varying ultrasound field, from which we then reconstruct an image based on solving a linear signal model. This has the advantage of requiring only a few measurements to image an entire 3D volume, in contrast to time-reversal work. This difference in acquisition time is crucial for medical imaging where the object changes over time, for example, in a beating heart. Another important distinction is the small impedance difference between our coding mask and imaging medium (less than a factor of 2). As a consequence, there is very little loss of acoustic energy as compared to reverberant cavities that inherently require high impedance mismatch to ensure signal diversity (33, 34). Besides the time-reversal work, our technique also shares some common ground with the 2D localization work by Clement et al. (35–37). They successfully showed that frequency-dependent wave field patterns can be used to localize two point scatterers in a 2D plane using only one sensor in receive. Instead of solving a linear system as we propose here, the authors used a dictionary containing measured impulse responses and a cross-correlation technique to find the two point scatterers. By contrast, we propose to induce signal diversity using local delays in both transmit and receive. This type of “wave field coding” can be applied to many other imaging techniques and seems to offer a much higher dynamic range than the slowly varying frequency-dependent wave fields. As a result, we are able to move beyond the localization of isolated point scatterers but perform actual 3D imaging as we show in this paper. The findings reported in this paper demonstrate that compressive imaging in ultrasound using a coded aperture is possible and practically feasible. Our device has disadvantages and limitations and does not deliver similar functionality as existing 3D ultrasound arrays. For example, we cannot focus the transmission beam, making techniques such as tissue harmonic imaging that require high acoustic power less accessible (37). In addition, the mechanical rotation of the mask is expected to introduce a fair amount of error in the prediction of the ultrasound field and limits the usability when it comes down to imaging moving tissue or the application of ultrasound Doppler. Besides, a rotating wave field becomes less effective at pixels closer to the center of rotation—assuming a spatially uniform generation of spatial frequencies. Future systems should consider the incorporation of other techniques to introduce signal variation, such as controlled linearized motion, or a mask that can be controlled electronically, similar to the digital mirror devices used in optical compressive imaging (13). Furthermore, the angular spectrum approach method that predicts the ultrasound field inside the medium is not flawless in cases where the medium contains strong variations in sound speed and density. These issues may possibly be solved, however, by incorporating more advanced ultrasound field prediction tools that can deal with these kinds of variations (38). This will increase the computational burden of the image reconstruction even further but may potentially lead to better results than what we have shown here. One of the fundamental ideas of this paper is to prove that spatial wave compression allows for compressive imaging. Hence, this technique is applicable not only to ultrasound but also to many other imaging and localization techniques that normally rely on spatial sampling of coherent wave fields. With respect to clinical ultrasound, we believe that the proposed technique may prove to be useful in cases where signal reduction is beneficial, for example, in minimally invasive imaging catheters. Furthermore, we think that a coded aperture mask could potentially be used in conjunction with conventional 1D ultrasound arrays to better estimate the out-of-plane signals and possibly extend the normal 2D imaging capabilities to 3D. Alternative coded aperture implementations for ultrasound compressive imaging are certainly possible. However, the range of the physical parameters that we can vary to create a useful coded aperture for ultrasound seems less diverse compared to optics. The properties of light are such that it can easily be blocked very locally (for example, by absorption), which is hardly possible with ultrasound waves because of their mechanical nature and larger wavelengths. The idea of applying local delays in the ultrasound field to uniquely address every pixel therefore seems more practical. Ultimately, it will be these kinds of physical parameters that will dictate whether and to what extent true compressive imaging is possible. Restricting ourselves to local time delays, we have successfully shown in this paper that the physics of ultrasound allow for the ultimate compression of a 3D volume in a few measurements with a single sensor and a simple coding mask.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Mask manufacturing Our aim was to make a spatiotemporally varying ultrasound field by locally introducing phase shifts in the wave transmitted by the sensor. We did so by introducing a mask that delays the wave locally, similar to the function of a phase spatial light modulator in optics (39). The aberration mask that we put in front of the sensor was made from an 11-mm-thin circular plastic layer (Perspex), in which we had drilled holes 1 mm in diameter (Fig. 5C). The depth and positions of these holes were randomly chosen by an algorithm, allowing for a depth ranging between 0.1 and 1 mm and for a maximum of 0.5-mm overlap between the holes. The holes were drilled using a computer numeric control machine (P60 HSC, Fehlmann). The choice for 1-mm holes was made because of convenience of manufacturing. At room temperature, the speed of sound propagation in water is approximately 1480 m/s, whereas the speed of sound in the Perspex material is 2750 m/s. Perspex has good properties in terms of processing, high sound speed, and low acoustic absorption. Acoustic setup For the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves, we used one large sensor of piezocomposite material that had an active diameter of 12.7 mm and a center frequency of 5 MHz (C309-SU, Olympus Panametrics NDT Inc.). The sensor was coupled to a pulser/receiver box (5077PR, Olympus Panametrics NDT Inc.) that can generate a short −100 V transmit spike and amplifies signals in receive up to 59dB. No filtering was applied in receive. The sensor with the mask was mounted in a tank filled with water measuring 200 × 300 × 200 mm. In the water, we placed two plastic letters that had been 3D-printed (Objet30, Stratasys Ltd.). To enhance the ultrasound reflection from these letters, we sprayed only the letters with silicon carbide powder (size, k800). The two letters “E” and “D” refer to the names of our academic institutions, Erasmus Medical Center and Delft University of Technology. The thin plastic coding mask was part of a larger round casing that fitted snugly around the sensor (Fig. 6E). To this casing, we fitted a cogwheel that allows the casing to be rotated in front of the sensor using a small rubber band and an electronic rotary stage (T-RS60A, Zaber Technologies). By rotating the aberration mask, we were essentially able to rotate the interference pattern inside the stationary medium, allowing for multiple observations of the same object. We allowed a thin water film between the plastic mask and the sensor surface to ensure optimal coupling between the piezo material and the plastic mask. With this setup, it took about 1 min to acquire the signals needed to reconstruct the 3D volume shown in Fig. 6. Acoustic calibration procedure Before we could use our device for imaging, we needed to know the signature of our interference pattern. That is, we needed to know what the transmission and receive wave fields looked like in both space and time, so that we could populate our system matrix H. Note that for every spatial point, we had a unique temporal ultrasound signal. This calibration step is an essential component in this kind of compressive imaging (40). The better H is known, the better the reconstruction of the image. For our calibration procedure, we recorded the transmission wave field in a plane perpendicular to the ultrasound propagation axis using a 3D translation stage (BiSlide MN10-0100-M02-21, Velmex) and a broadband needle hydrophone (0.5 to 20 MHz, 0.2-mm diameter; Precision Acoustics) coupled to a programmable analog-to-digital converter (DP310, Acqiris USA) using 12 bits per sample and a 200-MHz sampling rate. For the results presented in this paper, we recorded the wave field in a 30 × 30 mm plane located 2.5 mm in front of the aberration mask using a step size of 0.12 mm (less than two times the highest spatial frequency detected) in both the x and y directions (Figs. 3 and 4). The signal of every pixel was obtained using the angular spectrum approach to address pixels at greater depth, using autoconvolution to account for the pulse-echo acquisition, and using linear interpolation to account for additional rotation measurements; all of which were implemented in MATLAB software, release 2015b (The MathWorks). We noticed that our sensor was not completely axisymmetric, meaning that the mask wave interaction changes slightly upon mask rotation. This issue was solved by measuring four rotated planes (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°). We generated all intermediate planes by linear interpolation between each pair of neighboring planes. The calibration procedure took around 1.5 hours, after which the complete spatiotemporal impulse response of the sensor was known. Note that this calibration is sensor- and mask-specific and, in principle, only needs to be done once. Approximate model and CRLB To analyze the CRLB for the estimation of a single scatterer from one or more pulse-echo measurements, we derived the expressions for computing the Fisher information matrix, the inverse of which was computed numerically to obtain the CRLB covariance matrix. The following assumptions and conventions were used: (i) Any noise or other errors can be modeled as zero mean white Gaussian additive noise, with variance σ2. Hence, this analysis is only valid if noise sources, such as electronic, quantization, or jitter noise, can be modeled as Gaussian random variables, and their total effect is compounded into the signal-to-noise figure. (ii) The ultrasound field due to the coding mask can be approximated as a collection of point sources, where the point sources are located at the surface of the mask. The point in time at which each virtual point source is excited is determined by the time of arrival of the ultrasound field from the true sensor location through the mask to the end of the mask. (iii) The impulse response for the main sensor is taken as being equal to a Gaussian pulse: , where l determines the pulse width or frequency bandwidth. (iv) The origin of the spatial axes corresponds to the center of the main sensor surface, with the sensor lying in the xy plane and the z axis perpendicular to the sensor surface. (v) The sensor is excited by a single Dirac delta pulse. (vi) The position of the virtual source j is denoted as , and the set of all s j is denoted as S. Vector variables are indicated by bold typesetting. (vii) The ith element of a vector k is denoted as [k] i . Under the assumptions above, the forward pressure wave field measured at position θ = [x, y, z]T can be written as where . This can be regarded as the convolution of the sensor impulse response with the mask impulse response: p(t, θ) = h(t) * m(t, θ, S). The echo signal can then be expressed as a(t, θ) = h(t) * m(t, θ, S) * m(t, θ, S) * h(t), or simply a(t, θ) = p(t, θ) * p(t, θ), which is equal to the autoconvolution of the forward pressure wave field at θ. Under the white Gaussian noise assumption, it can be shown that the (i, j)-th entry of the Fisher information matrix is equal to where a(θ) is a vector representing the discretized signal a(t, θ). Next, we derived the derivative of a(θ). We started by computing the derivative of a(t, θ) Using the definition of p(t, θ) and τ(θ, s j ), we find that which can be discretized to obtain da(θ)/d[θ] i for a single measurement. From I(θ), the CRLB is found as I(θ)−1. Image reconstruction Here, we formalized our image reconstruction problem in a set of linear equations u = Hv + n. This formalization allowed for a multitude of solvers to be applied to this problem. We applied two inversion methods to find v from u. The first was the least squares estimate, which finds the image v that minimizes the squared error between the model Hv and observation u as follows: . This estimate is known to be the minimum variance unbiased estimator if the linear model is valid, and the noise n is the white Gaussian. To implement this estimator, we used the LSQR algorithm (25), which is especially appropriate for large-scale sparse systems. By limiting the number of iterations, one can regularize the reconstruction problem [see, for example, the study by Hansen (26)]; this also allows for balancing of the resolution, the noise robustness, or the contrast. For the reconstructed letters shown in Fig. 6 (B and D), we used about 15 iterations, which took several seconds to compute. The results did not seem to vary much between 7 and 40 iterations. Above 50 iterations, we observed a serious loss in contrast as the algorithm starts to fit the solution to the noise and errors present in our H matrix. For the complete reconstruction of the 3D volume shown in Fig. 6F, we applied a BPDN algorithm (27), exploiting the sparsity of the image because we were only interested in two reflecting letters in an otherwise empty medium (water). For this purpose, we chose to use the iterative two-step shrinkage/thresholding algorithm, named TwIST, using l 1 -norm regularization (41) for implementation, although other algorithms that are capable of l 1 -based optimization are also viable. By this approach, we minimized the BPDN cost-function , where λ is a dimensionless scalar that weights the amount of regularization. The BPDN algorithm regularization parameter λ was chosen by defining a region of interest (ROI) containing the reconstructed letters and an ROI outside the letters and computed the contrast ratio as 20 log 10 (I letter /I background ) for a range of λ values, where I letter or I background are the average values of |v| over the pixels in the corresponding ROI. We then chose the λ that offered the highest contrast ratio. Using this procedure, we observed a contrast of 9 dB for regularized least squares and 29 dB for the l 1 regularization. For this proof-of-principle study, it shows that selecting a suitable λ is possible in a similar way as in real-life clinical ultrasound imaging, where the operator tunes some critical image reconstruction parameters (such as speed of sound) by visual feedback on image quality. In further research, it should be investigated if λ should be tuned for image content or a globally optimal λ can be established. If the latter is the case, an optimal λ should be established over large sets of training images, and its generality tested on independent test images. The 3D rendering of the letters shown in Fig. 6F were performed using the open-source visualization tool ParaView (www.paraview.org) (42).

Microstructure Analysis of the Tunnel Junctions
Piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) was performed to characterize the ferroelectric domain structure of BTO films in a separate FTJ device without Pt electrode. Figure 1 (b) show the topography, and out-of-plane (OOP) PFM phase images of BTO film with the thickness of 2 nm grown on LSMO/STO/Si heterostructure. The OOP PFM phase image showed uniform contrast; while there was no signal in in-plane PFM images (thus were not shown here). In our PFM system, the yellow contrast in OOP image means the polarization points up (upward), while the purple contrast means the polarization points down (downward). So the PFM result indicates a single downward domain structure in BTO films. To switch the downward polarization, a negative DC bias of −4 V was applied to a selected area through the tip. After the switching, the downward domain changed into upward domain, which reveals a 180° switching path as shown in Fig. 1 (c). Figure 1 (d) shows the PFM hysteresis loops of the 2 nm thick BTO film, indicating its ferroelectric nature. According to the basic quantum mechanism, the tunneling transmittance depends exponentially on the barrier width as well as the barrier height. It has already been reported that a giant TER was achieved by modulating the barrier width using n-type doped Nb:SrTiO 3 as bottom electrode through ferroelectric field effect16. In this work, hole doped LSMO is used as the bottom electrode. Therefore, in our case, ON state of the tunnel junction is achieved by a narrower barrier width when the polarization of BTO points up (hole accumulation state at LSMO interface), while OFF state is realized by a wider barrier width when the polarization points downward (hole depletion state at LSMO interface).
The high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the heterostructures (STO/Si and LSMO/STO/Si) are shown in Fig. 2 (a). The calculated average c lattice constant of STO is about 0.4 nm. The elongated c lattice is due to the large compressive strain of about 1.7% between STO and Si with the STO unit cell rotated by 45° relative to the Si conventional unit cell. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the rocking curve of STO/Si XRD (002) peak (Supplementary figure S1) is about 0.37°. These XRD spectra suggest a good epitaxial growth of the perovskite film on Si. Figure 2 (b–d) shows the schematic drawing of the cross-sectional structure and the cross-sectional high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of the tunneling device. The thickness of BTO tunnel barrier, LSMO bottom electrode, and STO template layer is about 2, 12.3, and 28 nm, respectively. Between the crystalline Si substrate and the crystalline STO layer, there is an amorphous layer of SiO x with the thickness around 8–9 nm. This amorphous layer forms during the oxide films deposition process21,22. To be specific, there are two processes during the growth that may lead to the formation of the amorphous layer. Firstly, during the growth of STO template layer, the oxygen might diffuse into the STO/Si interface and oxidize the Si substrate as the STO layer grew thicker, although the STO layer preserves the original epitaxial registry during the subsequent growth. Secondly, the following LSMO and BTO layers were deposited at 650 °C with an oxygen pressure of 300 mTorr and 5 mTorr, respectively. Under these growth conditions, the oxygen could diffuse through the STO layer and further oxidize the Si substrate. The interfaces between amorphous SrO x layers and crystalline Si and STO layers are shown in Fig. 2 (c). The transitions between crystalline and amorphous phases can be clearly observed. Figure 2 (d) shows the interfaces of LSMO/STO, and BTO/LSMO heterostructures. These interfaces are almost atomically sharp, which proves the high epitaxial quality of the perovskite films. The Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) patterns of BTO, LSMO, STO, and Si TEM images are shown in Supplementary figure S2. The calculated average lattice parameter ratio c/a of STO layer is about 1.02. The elongated c lattice is due to the compressive strain between the film and Si substrate, which is consistent with the XRD result. The in-plane lattice constant a of LSMO is around 0.383 nm, which will cause a compressive strain to BTO (the in-plane lattice constant of bulk BTO is 0.399 nm) layer due to the lattice mismatch. The calculated tetragonality (c/a ratio) of BTO is about 1.07, which is much larger than the bulk value of 1.01. The increased tetragonality can greatly enhance the polarization of BTO thin film and favors the maintenance of ferroelectricity for an ultra-thin BTO layer23.

Basic Properties of the Tunnel Junctions
The current-voltage (I–V) curves for both upward and downward polarization states of the tunneling device with 2 nm BTO are shown in Fig. 3 (a). The applied voltage is termed as positive (negative) if a positive (negative) bias is applied to the top Pt electrode. After poling the polarization up (down) by applying a voltage pulse of −3 V (+3 V), the tunneling currents are measured at room temperature within low dc range, from −0.3 V to 0.3 V, which is certainly lower than the coercive voltage (V C ). For both on and off states, the I–V curves are nonlinear, which is an indication of elastic electron tunneling. With a reading voltage of 0.3 V, the currents for the ON and OFF states of this device with 2 nm BTO layer reach 1.28E-6 A and 8.03E-9 A, respectively, giving a TER ratio of 15800%. To reveal the influence of the ferroelectric thin film thickness on the tunneling effect, the dependence of the TER ratio on the BTO film thickness was studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 (b). The largest TER ratio was achieved when the BTO thickness is 2 nm. In this work, five devices were measured, the average TER ratio being around 12000%. When the BTO thickness decreases to 1.5 nm, the TER ratio drops rapidly and almost disappears. This may be due to the fact that the ferroelectricity of BTO film becomes very weak or even disappears when its thickness approaches 1.5 nm. This result is consistent with the report that the critical thickness for ferroelectricity of BTO film on STO substrate is around 1.6 nm24. However, we believe this may also be due to the increased leakage probability for thinner BTO layers where by reducing the device size significant TER was seen even with BTO layer thicknesses of 0.8 nm (2 unit cells)25. When the thickness of BTO goes up to 3 and 4 nm, the TER ratio also decreases drastically. This may be because with the increased barrier width, the tunneling effect would no long dominate and other mechanisms start to play a role. In the following discussions, we focus on the FTJ device with BTO thickness of 2 nm.
Figure 3 (a) I–V curves of the tunnel junction (2 nm BTO) with different BTO polarizations. The inset shows the I-V curve of the OFF state (P down). (b) R-V switching curve of the junction (2 nm BTO). (c) TER ratios of the tunnel junctions as the function of BTO thickness. (d) Electrical resistance as functions of switching time for both upward and downward polarization states of the junctions (switching pulse ±3 V). The two points on the y-axis which correspond to 100 of x-axis represent the original OFF and ON states, respectively. Full size image
The non-volatile electrical resistance switching (R-V loop) of Pt/BTO/LSMO/STO/Si device with BTO thickness of 2 nm is illustrated in Fig. 3 (c). Similar to the PFM hysteresis loop of ferroelectric in Fig. 1 (d), a clear hysteretic variation of the tunneling resistance is observed. This proves that it is the polarization that causes the change of the resistance. The coercive voltage is below 2 V. It is shown that with the positive and negative voltage pulse switching the device shows the high and low resistance states, respectively. A positive pulse above coercive voltage switches the polarization of BTO to downward direction towards the bottom electrode and vice versa. The high (low) resistance at the positive (negative) voltage can be explained by the change of tunnel barrier width through the depletion (accumulation) of the hole concentration in LSMO bottom electrodes.
Writing Speed, Data Retention, and Fatigue Performance of the Tunnel Junctions
To evaluate the writing speed of the ferroelectric tunnel junction on silicon substrate, the dependence of the switching pulse width on the electrical resistance of the FTJ device were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 3(d). Square pulses with the width from 10 ns (the limit of our pulse generator) to 1 μs are used to control the polarization direction of the BTO tunnel barrier, and the I–V curves were measured subsequently to detect the electrical resistance of the device (Supplementary figure S3). After applying ±3 V pulses, the spontaneous polarization starts to switch at 10 ns. At 50 ns, the polarization is fully reversed and the ON and OFF electrical resistances saturate at the expected values. The results demonstrate that the ferroelectric tunnel junctions can be written within 50 ns. However, this is by no means the limit. Shorter writing time is expected if higher pulse voltage is used26. In fact, it has already been reported that polarization switching of ferroelectric Pb(Nb 0.04 Zr 0.28 Ti 0.68 )O 3 thin film can be realized with a voltage pulse less than 1 ns generated by a semiconductor photoconductive switch27. To read the ON and OFF states of the tunnel junctions, we can detect the electrical resistance by simply measuring the I–V curves. Therefore the reading process is non-destructive since it does not require the switching of the ferroelectric polarization.
Long data retention and superior fatigue performance are two critical requirements for the application of non-volatile memory devices. We have monitored the resistance of several tunnel junctions for one week, and no deterioration in the signal has been observed (Fig. 4 (a)). The junctions were under open boundary condition during the periods between the read-out measurements. By extrapolation, we can estimate that the TER ratio of the junctions could be maintained over 10000% for more than 10 years. Furthermore, the tunnel junctions have been subjected to bipolar switching for up to 105 cycles, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The fatigue properties were measured by applying bipolar electrical pulses of ±3 V (pulse width of 0.05 ms) with different durations to the devices. After each cycling, the devices were set to ON and OFF states again, and I–V curves were measured accordingly to test the corresponding resistance state (Supplementary figure S4). As shown in Fig. 4 (b), after 105 cycles, the tunnel junctions can still be switched to the original ON and OFF states, with only a slightly decreased TER ratio. This proves that the polarization of BTO thin film is still switchable after 105 cycles. With further electrical cycling, the tunnel junctions could not function any more, which might be due to domain wall pinning of the BTO thin film. It is well known that oxide electrodes can mitigate the fatigue problem in ferroelectric oxide, because they can reduce the oxygen vacancy concentration at the film/electrode interface, leading to less domain pinning28. This suggests that fatigue properties of tunnel junctions might be improved further by fine tuning the interfaces between the electrodes and tunnel barrier. The endurance of current FTJ device in this work is larger than that of the NAND flash memory (around 104 cycles).

A MOMENT in Hawthorn seven years ago changed everything for Aaron Bones and Marietta Thompson. It was the day they each devoured their first Grill’d burgers. The pair will recreate the moment when they open Ballarat’s first Grill’d franchise store on Friday. MORE BALLARAT FOOD STORIES HERE “We always loved the brand and would travel to Melbourne to eat Grill’d,” Ms Thompson said. “Ballarat was missing something and it wasn’t until 18 months ago that we acted on it.” The Sturt Street store will be the largest Grill’d restaurant in Australia, seating 180 people. “We are really excited,” Mr Bones said. “We’ve hired 40 young people from 600 job applications.” Ms Thompson said the opening of Grill’d would not contribute to Ballarat’s obesity problem. “Absolutely not, it is a healthy alternative for the Ballarat community,” she said. “You have the option of ordering salad ... it is fresh and healthy.” About 20 community groups have registered to be a part of the Grill’d Local Matters program. “Every month Grill’d Ballarat will give $500 to local community groups,” Ms Thompson said. Customers can select a community group to be in the running for the prize when they purchase a main menu item in store. “We are trying to give some of the smaller groups an opportunity to get funding,” Ms Thompson said. Free burgers will be served for dine-in customers at the Sturt Street restaurant between 11am and 2pm. Grill’d Ballarat will open between 11am and 11pm on weekends and 11am and 10pm on weekdays.

Diego Hurtado renunció como director de la Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT), el organismo dependiente del Ministerio de Ciencia dedicado a promover la investigación científica tecnológica y la innovación en el país.
En una dura carta de renuncia enviada el pasado viernes al ministro Lino Barañao y publicada por Página 12, el director habló de contradicciones, falacias y posverdad en la cartera científica; y alertó que no hay un plan nacional para el sector de ciencia y tecnología.

¿Qué dice la renuncia?


Buenos Aires, 15 de diciembre de 2017

Al Señor
Ministro de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva
Dr. Lino Barañao

Por la presente, le hago llegar mi renuncia al cargo de Director de la Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT) del Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva (MINCyT).

Motivan mi renuncia las numerosas contradicciones y falacias acumuladas que, a mi juicio, ya no dejan dudas del proceso de degradación institucional que transita el MINCyT, marcado por el achicamiento del sector que Usted niega públicamente, negando la simple aritmética, la ausencia de rumbo y el trato negligente a los investigadores jóvenes, principal valor intangible y garantía de futuro de una democracia.

Mientras el MINCyT no cumple las metas del Plan Argentina Innovadora 2020, que Usted mismo impulsó, hace un mes anunció que se comenzaba a trabajar en el Plan Argentina Innovadora 2030, que entraría en vigencia en no menos de dos años. Esto significa que no habrá plan nacional para el sector de ciencia y tecnología por un plazo mínimo de dos años. ¿Pero, además, si Usted ahora niega las metas del Plan Argentina Innovadora 2020, qué garantía tiene el sector de que Usted no volverá a negar las metas del Plan Argentina Innovadora 2030?

En la actualidad está vigente en la ANPCyT el programa Desarrollo y Fabricación de Aerogeneradores de Alta Potencia que financia, desde 2013, proyectos de I+D local con más de 100 millones de pesos. Sin embargo, simultáneamente, el programa Renovar impulsado por el Ministerio de la Producción decide excluir a la industria nacional y comprar tecnología importada.

También la ANPCyT impulsa el Proyecto Estratégico enfocado en el Desarrollo de Partes Nacionales para Satélites mientras, simultáneamente, se paraliza el ArSat 3 y, por lo tanto, la línea de desarrollo de satélites geoestacionarios prevista por la Ley 27.208.

Luego de haber sido electo el Dr. Roberto Salvarezza para integrar el Directorio del Conicet, Usted se niega a formalizar su incorporación sin dar a conocer las razones, sentando un precedente sombrío para la vida democrática del sector.

En el nivel de las francas falacias, cuando el presidente Mauricio Macri afirmó en la ceremonia de entrega de los premios Houssay que prácticamente se duplicó el presupuesto en ciencia y tecnología (La Nación, 7/12/17) y Usted avala esta afirmación en lugar de corregirla, se pone en evidencia que la degradación institucional del MINCyT es intencional.

Siguiendo su propia lógica y suponiendo que el principal problema de la ciencia de nuestro país fuera el que Usted diagnostica hacen faltan investigadores con un perfil diferente, más insertos en las necesidades del país (La Nación, 24-12-16), entonces debería explicarnos, luego de 10 años al frente del MINCyT, cuál es ese perfil diferente por el que parece que Usted no trabajó o no supo impulsar. Su afirmación solo es coherente con su renuncia.

Podría multiplicar la lista de ejemplos. Cuando afirmó que no hay ningún país que, con un 30 por ciento de pobres, esté aumentando el número de investigadores (El Cronista, 6/12/2006), debería recordar que en 2003 la Argentina tenía más de un 50% de pobreza, que en 2015 se había logrado disminuirla a un 30% y que, en ese contexto, Usted impulsó el Plan Argentina Innovadora 2020 y las metas de crecimiento del Conicet y del sector que ahora niega. De paso, digamos que en marzo de 2017, según la UCA, la pobreza creció al 32,9% (El Cronista, 9/3/2017).

La tenaz puesta en circulación de falacias que Usted utiliza para negar la destrucción del sector de ciencia y tecnología está avalada por la maquinaria de producción de posverdad, práctica asidua del gobierno que Usted representa. Es decir, Usted no duda en usar argumentos de fantasía, porque cuenta con la comunicación oficialista en un país sin ley para evitar los oligopolios en el sector empresarial de los medios de comunicación, que hace pasar sus falacias por afirmaciones verosímiles. Así, Usted colabora con la destrucción de la esfera pública, entendida como el conjunto de espacios colectivos para el diálogo, el debate y el consenso imprescindibles para la vida democrática. Extraña paradoja que un Ministro del sector científico se dedique a demoler las pautas mínimas de racionalidad con su discurso.

Por estas razones le hago llegar mi renuncia al Directorio de la ANPCyT.

Sin otro particular, lo saluda

Dr. Diego Hurtado

Seeking help from others, environmentalists are now turning to crowdfunding to raise funds for not only equipment, but also for their new big ideas. During a recent interview, marketing manager at Australia-based Landcare NSW, Jenny Quealy, reported the company has teamed up with crowdfunding platform Pozible for a new partnership called, Landcare & Environment Collection.
Quealy noted, “Landcare has just recently received 100 expresions of interest, ranging from fish hatcheries, to fish ladders, saving endangered species, to planting trees in bushfire affected areas… or even new sheds. We often don’t think of faring as a creative pursuit, but it is.”
According to Pozible, “In celebration of World Environment Day and the 25 year anniversary of Landcare, Pozible and Landcare are thrilled to announce the launch of a new global crowdfunding partnership: The Landcare & Environment Collection.”
“The Landcare & Environment Potential for matched funds (on the Collect will be a space on both the Pozible and Landcare websites that will showcase and support the crowdfunding campaigns of environmental groups in Australia and around the world.”
Those who launch a campaign on the crowdfunding platform will receive the following support:
Your project will be featured on the Landcare & Pozible website as part of the Landcare & Environmental Collect.
Support, training, and preparation for your campaign from a Landcare crowdfunding Ambassador.
Access to exclusive environment focused crowdfunding workshops.
Regular promotion of The Landcare & Environment Collection through Pozible’s website, newsletter and social media.
Regular promotion of the Landcare & Environment Collect through Landcare’s networks. condition that your campaign in successful).
Sourced by Landcare through government, business, and private philanthropy.
25 projects, which includes 15 Australian and 10 international, will be selected for the Landcare & Environment Collect during the Landcare Week at the National Landcare Conference in September. The projects will be featured on the collection during September, before it becomes open to all environment projects in October.
Sharing the backstory of the partnership, Pozible explained, “Landcare approached Pozible a few months ago suggesting it is time environment projects had their own category on Pozible as there are millions of environmental groups around the world and 6000 Lnadcare groups in Australia alone. Environment projects are innovative, impactful, have strong community support and are in need of funding.”
Quealy also revealed those who have innovated ideas they’d like to raise funds for do not need to be tech savvy to a campaign. “The tech side of it has been done for you because the platform sets that up. It’s very simple to go to the website where the Landcare and Environment Collection is and there you can find a very simple form where you can start a project.”

Strong correlation effects manifest as unusual behavior of physical response functions. Of these, the frequency and momentum dependent spin susceptibility, χ(q, ω), played a pivotal role in the study of e.g. high-temperature superconductors1, spin-ice compounds2, and the fundamental description of magnetic resonance experiments in correlated systems3. This response function is available experimentally using ac magnetization measurements, neutron scattering, magnetic resonance, Mössbauer spectroscopy, spin-resolved STM, or microwave cavity perturbation experiments. Common to these method is that it is difficult to deduce the full ω dependent signal, the analysis of experiment therefore relies on the theoretical description of the susceptibility.
The long wavelength spin susceptibility, χ(q → 0, ω), called the ac or dynamic spin susceptibility (DSS), indicates dissipative processes and remains in the focus of interest when studying the nature of correlations in emergent materials, such as e.g. those manifesting the spin-liquid phase4. DSS is also important in identifying the transition temperature of spin-glasses5 and superconductors6, characterizing superparamagnetism of small ferromagnetic nanoparticles7, or examining the nature of magnetic phase transitions. Another highly relevant reason to study DSS is that it provides a measure of spin-relaxation rate, whose knowledge is in turn important for spintronics applications8. DSS is characterized in the usual materials (where spin-orbit interaction is small) by a Lorentzian9,10,11,12, which is peaked at the Zeeman energy and whose linewidth provides a direct measure of the spin-relaxation rate.
In a normal metal without spin orbit coupling (SOC), the DSS reduces to ωδ(ω ± B) with B the Zeeman field, even in the presence of non-magnetic impurities and electron-electron interaction, which yield a finite lifetime for the electrons, since these preserve the rotational invariance of spin space, and cannot induce a finite spin lifetime on their own. The essential ingredient for spin relaxation is the breaking of this symmetry, which is naturally provided by the SOC. Then, combined with the above sources of relaxation, the sharp Dirac-delta peak broadens and in many cases, assumes a Lorentzian form, whose width is determined by the SOC and the momentum lifetime. This usually occurs in the case of weak spin orbit coupling (SOC).
However, SOC is usually the dominant energy scale in topological insulators13,14 which strongly entangles their magnetic properties with their charge response, and causes their peculiar helical spin structure13. While existence of topological states can be revealed by imaging their band structure via ARPES13 or by transport measurement15, the detection of the underlying spin texture13,14, resulting from the conspiracy of spin and charge degrees of freedom, represents a challenging task. The DSS is uniquely sensitive to the spin arrangement and an unusual, non-Lorentzian behavior of the DSS might occur. Here, we study DSS in topological insulators in the full temperature, doping, Zeeman energy and frequency range. We do find a non-Lorentzian form of the DSS and most surprisingly a non-zero value of the DSS even in the large frequency limit. This, on the one hand, is identified as a new hallmark of time reversal symmetry protected16 topological insulators in various dimensions, stemming from their unique spin texture, as we show below for i) the spin Hall edge state, ii) its strongly correlated counterpart, the helical liquid in 1D, iii) 2D helical Dirac fermions, iv) and the Weyl semimetal in 3D. We stress that the contribution from bulk states is neglected and our results on the boundary modes are valid for energies below the bulk gap of topological insulators. On the other hand, this also implies that the spin-relaxation rate cannot be determined from the DSS, much as its knowledge is desired for prospective spintronics applications. This result is understood in analogy to the case of optical conductivity of neutral graphene: it does not follow the usual Drude-Lorentz form due to two-band excitations, therefore it cannot be used to determine the momentum relaxation rate17.

As the strike by 39,000 Verizon and Verizon Wireless workers continues into its third week, efforts are underway to broaden picketing at Verizon Wireless stores across the country. Workers at seven Wireless stores in Brooklyn, New York, and Everett, Massachusetts, are on strike, along with wireline workers from Massachusetts to Virginia.
The Communications Workers are working with Jobs with Justice to get local unions and community groups across the country to “Adopt-a-Store”—meaning they would agree to picket and leaflet outside Verizon Wireless corporate stores at least twice a week for two to three hours.
But a few CWA locals didn’t wait for a lead from their District or the national to get going.
“We still believe in the old adage that an injury to one is an injury to all,” said Dave Ratcliff, secretary-treasurer of Local 6012 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which picketed a Verizon Wireless store on the afternoon of Saturday, April 23. “We saw our union brothers and sisters in the Northeast struggling and we wanted to let them and Verizon know that they’re not alone.”
Thirty people showed up to the picket—including members of the Northeastern Oklahoma Labor Council, along with Transport Workers Local 514 members who work as mechanics at American Airlines.
The picket targeted the busiest store in the area. “It drove the store manager crazy with us being there—I don’t think they expected us to show up at all,” said Chad Barnhill, president of Local 6012, whose members work primarily at AT&T and AT&T Mobility.
The local ABC and NBC affiliates in Tulsa both kicked off their six o’clock newscasts with coverage of the pickets. (See a clip here.)
Meanwhile, in Indiana, members of CWA Local 4900 organized informational pickets outside of Verizon Wireless locations in South Bend, Kokomo, Anderson, and Fort Wayne. Local 4900 represents 3,000 telecom workers throughout Indiana, mostly at AT&T.

The first picket, outside a Wireless store in South Bend, was organized by shop stewards Nick Fullmer and Brett Sloop. Both attended the 2016 Labor Notes Conference at the beginning of April, where they networked with other telecom union activists, including leaders of some of the locals now on strike.
“Coming back [from the Conference], we had a feeling it wouldn’t be long before those guys went out,” said Fullmer.
Over breakfast at the Conference, he and Sloop swapped info with CWA Local 1102 members from Staten Island, New York, including the local’s president. Thanks to that connection, “[we were] able to send him pictures and a personal letter saying Local 4900 has your back, we’re standing behind you guys,” said Fullmer. “[He replied] to say they’re looking forward to repaying us in the future.”
COMMON GRIEVANCES
Both Fullmer and Sloop are AT&T Premise Technicians, meaning they install and repair U-Verse services (the AT&T equivalent of Verizon FiOS)—and now DirecTV, too.
They see echoes of what’s happening at AT&T in the Verizon battle. “Whether it’s Verizon or it’s us, or any of the companies out there,” said Fullmer, “it seems to be the same struggle we’re going through—more work, less pay; reducing headcount; reducing benefits and increasing healthcare costs; cutting or eliminating pensions.”
Sloop said many techs are worried that AT&T might cut back on their construction workforce, which builds and maintains the fiber lines and infrastructure. “There’s work to be put out there, there’s customers to be had,” he said. “And the companies, they don’t want to spend that money for the infrastructure. They don’t want to make that investment.”
Fullmer said hearing about the severe discipline that Verizon has been dishing out to long-term workers “was really an eye-opener. We have our issues at AT&T,” he said, “but I can’t imagine having to go to work every day in that environment. And that’s another reason why we want to support Verizon workers—they shouldn’t have it that bad.”
Unlike Verizon, AT&T is still hiring—both for Premise Tech and call center jobs. Still, the union is fighting for job security.

“I believe that we’re all in the same struggle—I think it’s consistent from bargaining table to bargaining table,” said Ratcliff. “Constantly the companies are outsourcing, and contracting out what work they can. They’re constantly looking for ways to improve their bottom line as opposed to ways to be a better corporate citizen.”
In next year’s negotiations—the AT&T Southwest contract expires in April 2017—Local 6012 leaders anticipate a fight to maintain pensions, limit healthcare increases, and win better language on contracting.
MORE PICKETS PLANNED
CWA Local 3808 in Nashville, Tennessee, will picket the Verizon Wireless store in Green Hills—the wealthiest part of the city—on Friday, April 29. The organizer there, Darlene Stone, is a former CWA Local 1400 member from Vermont, who was forced into early retirement in 2009 after Verizon sold off a chunk of its New England operations to Fairpoint, which soon found itself on the verge of bankruptcy.
Stone said that in addition to AT&T workers and members of the Tennessee AFL-CIO, she expects T-Mobile call center workers to join the picket. These workers are members of T-Mobile Workers United (TU), CWA’s national organizing effort at the wireless giant.
Local 6012, meanwhile, is hoping to hit all six Verizon Wireless stores in the Tulsa area.
And on April 29, Local 4900 will be back out in front of a Verizon Wireless corporate store in South Bend. The local is also planning more pickets throughout Indiana next week.
How’d They Make the News?
How’d Local 6012’s picket become the top story on the evening news? Ratcliff and Barnhill said they made sure to send press releases to local news outlets a few days before the action. “We’ve just built relationships with these people over the years,” said Ratcliff, “so they reach out to us when stuff’s going on.” Patience is key. “I remember 15 years ago, doing mobilization,” Ratcliff said, “I’d communicate with [all the local press] and we’d get no media.” But they never gave up. “We try to reach out to them real consistently. It starts out with things like this.”
The local has shared pictures of the pickets with members across the state via the Local 4900 app, which a majority of the membership has downloaded. “It’s not always easy to get information between different areas,” said Sloop, “and that app has been a tool to do that.”
Sloop said he also sent pictures of the pickets to other CWA locals around the Midwest, hoping to encourage them to organize their own.
In addition to showing support with the Verizon strike, Local 4900’s Sloop hopes that these solidarity efforts can build a stronger network of local unions. At their second South Bend picket, they were joined by members of the National Association of Letter Carriers, IUE-CWA Local 84809 members from Steel Warehouse, a local steel plant, and Jobs with Justice activists.
“Whether you’re CWA, the Letter Carriers, the Steel Warehouse workers, the airlines—you’re only as strong as your weakest link,” said Sloop. “We want everybody to see that.”
"PREPARED FOR THE LONG HAUL"
Verizon presented what it termed its “last, best, and final offer” to the unions at the bargaining table on Thursday, April 28—their first bargaining session since the strike’s start.
CWA District 1 termed the company’s offer “little more than the “same old bullshit.’” According to the union’s bargaining report, while Verizon backed away from part of its proposal to be able to transfer workers anywhere in the foot print for up to two months at a time, they refused to budge on language around closing call centers, which would lead to jobs moving offshore, and refused to return any contracted out plant work to the bargaining unit.




Further, the District says, “there is still not one word about improving the wages, benefits and working conditions of Verizon Wireless retail store employees or a fair contract for the VZW techs.”
Verizon has announced that it will cut off striking workers’ health insurance as of May 1.
Morale on the picket lines remains high. “We’ve all been here so long that we understand much more what’s at stake,” said Greg Calabrese, a cable maintenance technician and member of Local 1109 in Brooklyn. This is his fifth strike in his 19 years with the company.
The last Verizon strike ended after two weeks without a settlement, and it took another 10 months for the union to get a deal. This time, said Calabrese, “nobody wants to go back without a contract. Everybody knows what we’re facing and are prepared for the long haul.”
Calabrese joined an early morning picket outside a Brooklyn Marriott, which succeeded in getting the manager to kick out several scabs who were staying there. Local 1101 in Manhattan and Local 1102 on Staten Island have also successfully given scabs the boot with early morning wake-up calls at local hotels over the past week.
IBEW and CWA locals in New Jersey held several mass rallies this week, including one in front of the statehouse in Trenton. Danny Nunez, a facilities technician and member of IBEW Local 827 who’s spent 29 years with the company, said, “It’s like night and day from the time I started. There’s just no respect for us anymore.”
“They really push us like machines—if they could hire robots they would,” said Tom Boylan, another Local 827 member who’s been a lineman for 27 years. “Now our bathroom breaks are watched and timed. Supervisors used to be former techs who knew the job. Now, they have no idea.”
“It’s hard to believe,” said Nunez, “that a company that makes so much money is always trying to nickel and dime us like this.”
“I’ll stay out for as long as it takes, and I’ll never cross a picket,” said Boylan.
Next week, in addition to manning the picket lines, CWA and IBEW activists will head to the Verizon shareholders’ meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A YouGov survey found that public perception of the company is at its lowest point in three years, when news emerged that Verizon was sharing millions of records with the National Security Agency.

China , que años atrás estaba lejos de ocupar un lugar preponderante para las relaciones comerciales de Uruguay, pasó, en 2013, a ser su principal socio comercial y en 2015 el principal destino de las exportaciones uruguayas.


Esto se dio en un contexto de apertura de China hacia el mundo y de un crecimiento año tras año en su economía. Como consecuencia de ese crecimiento y apertura comenzó a emerger una clase media más "occidentalizada" –de unas 300 o 400 millones de personas– con el anhelo y la capacidad económica para consumir bienes y servicios extranjeros. Y es allí justamente hacia donde Uruguay debe apuntar, dijo el country manager de Zonamerica en China, Javier Bahut Vega. "Todo lo que tenga valor añadido, o sea una marca de prestigio, tiene interés en China y es algo que reclaman mucho", añadió.


Un ejemplo de esta avidez es que en el aeropuerto de París, las tiendas de marcas prestigiosas como Louis Vuitton tuvieron que colocar traductores para ese público que pasó a ser su mayor comprador.
A su vez, la demanda de comidas rápidas bajó en China debido a recientes escándalos con proveedores de alimentos, y el consumidor local pasó a priorizar la calidad.

Con US$ 2.095 millones en ventas realizadas de Uruguay a China en 2015 (incluyendo las realizadas desde zonas francas) ese país se convirtió en el principal destino de exportación.


El mundo mira, hoy más que nunca, hacia Oriente como un territorio lleno de oportunidades y Uruguay no está ajeno a esa realidad. Carne y soja son los productos estrella, algo que no sorprende dadas las características favorables de Uruguay como productor de alimentos. Según el director ejecutivo de Uruguay XXI, Antonio Carámbula, el potencial de Uruguay en el sector agroalimentario sigue siendo grande debido a la trazabilidad de los productos. Pero que Uruguay tenga a China como el destino con la mayor cantidad de sus ventas al extranjero no significa que se le esté sacando todo el partido a una población de 1.200 millones de consumidores. "Hoy hay niveles importantes de exportación (hacia China), pero todavía lejos del potencial que podríamos tener ahí", remarcó Carámbula.


Igualmente, el director ejecutivo de Uruguay XXI instó a mirar el vaso medio lleno si se tiene en cuenta que hace unos años China no formaba parte de los principales socios de Uruguay en materia de bienes y que hoy tiene un superávit en la balanza comercial con ese país. "¿Es suficiente? No, hay que hacer mucho más. Pero se viene avanzando", señaló.


Por su parte, el gerente de desarrollo de Negocios de Zonamerica en China, Carlos Pérez Bañasco, agregó que "los chinos están comprando calidad y Uruguay tiene calidad para ofrecerles".


Otros segmentos
Más allá de la carne, la soja y la lana, hay otros sectores de los que se podría sacar provecho para diversificar las exportaciones a China.


Según el presidente de la Cámara de Comercio Uruguay-China, Gabriel Rozman, hay oportunidades en el segmento de la moda "de alta calidad" y los servicios globales. En el caso de la moda y el diseño, la barrera principal radica en el poco volumen. "Te piden que envíes 5.000 prendas y muchos no pueden. Tenemos industrias muy pequeñas en torno a eso y no podemos exportar de a uno". En ese sentido, aconsejó unirse entre competidores. "La oportunidad en exportar está en unir a las empresas para que tengan una sola marca y puedan trabajar juntos en las exportaciones a China", apuntó.


Para la coordinadora general de la Cámara de Diseño de Uruguay, Natalia Cáceres, las exportaciones de textil uruguayo hacia China no son un tema que esté sobre la mesa, por lo que, de existir algún "caso menor", aún no se cuenta con un relevamiento de ese negocio.


El mundo mira, hoy más que nunca, hacia Oriente como un territorio lleno de oportunidades y Uruguay no está ajeno a esa realidad.


En el caso de las empresas tecnológicas, la situación es similar. El destino más atractivo para estas empresas es Estados Unidos y hasta ahora son pocos los casos de empresas uruguayas en China, como Genexus y dLocal. De hecho, la Cámara Uruguaya de Tecnologías de la Información (CUTI) ha viajado a misiones comerciales en varios países, pero nunca a China. Según su presidente, Leonardo Loureiro, hay empresas que empezaron a ver a China con buenos ojos y varias son del ecosistema de Genexus. No obstante, desde el punto de vista formal los negocios con China aún "no entran dentro de la encuesta de la Cámara".


"Está bastante detrás de las prioridades. Muchas empresas están con el foco en Estados Unidos y cambiarlo para otro lugar es complicado", dijo. Cree que tomará unos cuantos años entender cómo hacer negocios con el gigante asiático. Pero Genexus se encuentra en proceso de demostrar al sector que se puede traspasar esa barrera.


La empresa inició su expansión en Asia en 2003 y al poco tiempo comenzó a dar sus primeros pasos en China a través de un socio local, explicó la gerenta comercial de la empresa, Gisela Bertelli. "Esa primera aproximación no fue buena y tiempo más tarde reiniciamos la búsqueda de nuevos partners locales que se comprometieran con el negocio". Hace cuatro años Genexus trabaja con la empresa Sungiant Information Technology. Hoy cuenta con 50 clientes, entre casas de software y corporaciones. Bertelli comentó que decidieron expandirse a través de distribuidores y representantes locales ya que eso permitió conocer la cultura y acceder a círculos de influencia regionales. De todos modos, la participación de la empresa en China, según explicó su gerenta comercial, es aún "menor" y Asia en su totalidad representa poco más del 30% de las ventas totales. Para Bertelli, poder ingresar al mercado chino es atractivo ya que permitiría a cualquier empresa lograr un crecimiento exponencial.


Para la gerenta comercial de Genexus, Gisela Bertelli, ingresar al mercado chino es atractivo ya que permitiría a cualquier empresa lograr un crecimiento exponencial.


Pero antes de embarcarse en esa "aventura", dijo que es necesario conocer y, sobre todo, entender que debe existir un período largo de siembra y construcción de la relación. Conocer la forma de negociación y el idioma fue un desafío inicial de Genexus en China. Pero uno de sus mayores desafíos se dio a nivel tecnológico.


Exportar a China obligó a la empresa a desarrollar servicios específicos para ese mercado. Eso porque Google, Facebook, Twitter, entre otros, no funcionan en China. Genexus desarrolló mapas locales (Baidu Maps), servicios de pago como Alipay y Wechat Pay, que son los servicios utilizados por clientes chinos. Bertelli dijo que al inicio fue importante estar cerca, por lo que viajaban periódicamente. "Definimos que una persona debía permanecer en China por períodos de tres meses. Por otro lado, los partners nos visitaban al menos una vez al año para reforzar el mensaje de solidez de la compañía y el compromiso de largo plazo", indicó.


Otra firma que exporta sus servicios a China es el spin off de Astropay, dLocal. Su director, Sergio Fogel, contó que al ser una procesadora de pagos, buscan ir a los lugares donde están las empresas que venden hacia los mercados donde tienen presencia y que, como varias empresas chinas venden hacia los países de Latinoamérica donde funciona su negocio, decidieron exportar hacia ese país. "Estuvimos tres años con la oficina hasta que hubo un momento donde no se hizo más necesario y seguimos atendiendo remotamente desde Montevideo o Europa", resumió.


Una puerta más
Con el 40% del comercio electrónico mundial, el medio online es otra modalidad de llegada al país asiático. El country manager de Zonamérica China puso como ejemplo el sondeo que realizan hoy con una bodega uruguaya para que pueda vender a través de comercio electrónico.


El presidente del Instituto Nacional de Vitivinicultura, José Lez, dijo que China aún no representa una parte significativa de los negocios del sector, pero que está dentro de las posibilidades que sea un objetivo en el corto plazo. Lez asistió a la última misión comercial junto al presidente Tabaré Vázquez en 2016. Zonamerica, por su parte, se encuentra en conversaciones con plataformas como Alibaba para posibilitar la venta de productos uruguayos. "Pusimos foco a partir de 2011 en ver si lo podemos cristalizar como un mercado fuerte", contó Lez.


Ni barato ni fácil
Desde el 1º de octubre comenzó a funcionar la plataforma de negocios de Zonamerica en China que busca abrir puertas a nuevas posibilidades para que empresas uruguayas –más allá de las de alimentos– enfoquen su mirada hacia el país asiático, y para que las que ya lo venían haciendo optimicen sus negocios.


Bahut Vega contó a Café & Negocios que para abrir una oficina en China se precisa de mínimo seis meses dedicados a toda la documentación requerida, a crear una sociedad jurídica y un presupuesto anual de, por lo menos, US$ 150 mil. En ese sentido, la plataforma de negocios se ofrece como un facilitador. Indicó que hay que aprovechar los valores que se comparten con los chinos al momento de hacer negocios. "El valor que damos a la familia, el salir a cenar después de una reunión. Hay que valerse de eso", dijo.


"Ya tenemos nuestras oficinas, presencia física y forma jurídica. Ya hemos realizado la inversión y facilitamos que las empresas puedan acceder al mercado sin tener esa primera gran barrera", apuntó el español Bahut Vega.

Para el country manager de Zonamerica, Javier Bahut Vega, todo aquello que sea único y especial puede tener un espacio en China, "pero eso no significa que vaya a ser fácil".


Ingresar al mercado chino está lejos de ser un camino simple. Para Bahut Vega, todo aquello que sea único y especial puede tener un espacio en China, "pero eso no significa que vaya a ser fácil".


"Hay una oportunidad, pero vas a tener que establecerte en el mercado, hacer campañas, que no es ni barato ni fácil en China. Distinguiría oportunidades que existen pero para materializarlas, el mercado chino es muy exigente", apuntó.



El gasto del consumidor chino aumentó 9,6 % entre 2009 y 2014, indica un informe de Uruguay XXI.


En esa línea, el presidente de la Cámara de Comercio Uruguay-China, Gabriel Rozman, opinó que "China no es para principiantes". Como anécdota, contó que una vez acompañó a un colega a abrir una cuenta en un banco y que tuvieron que dar media vuelta cuando le pidieron su nombre en chino. "Hasta esas cosas mínimas hay que tenerlas en cuenta" manifestó.


Según Bahut Vega, para que China forme parte de un plan de internacionalización de una empresa uruguaya, esta ya tiene que haber testeado el producto o servicio en otros mercados. "Si nunca has salido de Uruguay posiblemente China no sea el primer mercado. Tienen que ser empresas ya exportando sus productos en Latinoamérica", añadió.


China - Lac Unas 40 empresas uruguayas de diversos rubros formarán parte de la cumbre empresarial China-Lac, el principal evento entre China, América Latina y el Caribe, impulsado por el gobierno de China. El encuentro tendrá lugar entre el 30 de noviembre y el 2 de diciembre en el Centro de Convenciones de Punta del Este. Al evento se inscribieron 700 empresas y de ellas unas 200 son chinas. "Va a ser un buen punto de encuentro. Los chinos vienen con el deseo de hacer negocios. No vienen a hacer playa, vienen porque quieren hacer negocios con latinoamericanos", indicó Rozman. Loureiro, quien también participará junto a la CUTI de la cumbre, dijo que servirá para empezar a entender cómo hacer negocios con China, "ahorrarse un paso".
"El tema del aprendizaje es fundamental y más cuando para hacer negocios en China tenés que dar la vuelta al mundo", dijo. En ese evento se buscará no solo generar contactos para exportar en China, sino que también dar a conocer el mercado para posibles inversiones chinas en Uruguay.

Too many Washington students languish in underfunded classrooms, many with underpaid teachers, sharing old textbooks with peers and without the benefit of modern computers.
CARTER McCleary was in second grade in the rural Olympic peninsula town of Chimacum when the school-funding lawsuit named for his family was filed in King County Superior Court. He will be halfway through his senior year when the Legislature convenes in January, ostensibly to tackle the remaining and most difficult remedies in that case.
The governor and the Legislature must delay no longer. In 2012, the Washington state Supreme Court ruled in McCleary v. State of Washington that the state education-funding system was unconstitutional.
Now, representatives of the governor and Legislature will meet with justices Wednesday to argue they are on track to fulfill the state’s obligations to the 1.1 million children in Washington public schools. However, the state will argue it needs until September 2018 to solve two issues around the state’s overreliance on local levies and teacher compensation.
The plaintiffs, including Carter’s family, argue the deadline is September 2017 — and the state cannot delay any further.
They are right. Too many Washington students languish in underfunded classrooms, many with underpaid teachers, sharing old textbooks with peers and without the benefit of modern computers.
While some students are left behind, others are lucky enough to live in property-rich districts with more affluent taxpayers willing to tax themselves to make sure students have a rich experience with a variety of educational opportunities and support.

At the heart of the McCleary decision is equity — the difference between students with an education that prepares them for college or the modern world of work and those who are given the bare minimum. There are caring parents, teachers and community members in all of Washington’s schools. The difference is not only in the dollars — but how they are spent to provide the best outcomes for students.
The Chimacum School District was so hard up that Carter McCleary and his classmates were deprived of classroom time because the schools had them making holiday ornaments and other crafts for fundraising, his mother testified in 2009. Stephanie McCleary also spoke about old textbooks that were falling apart.
Another plaintiff, Patty Venema, testified about nonstop school fundraisers — gift wrap, bulbs, cookie dough — and that teachers at Cathcart Elementary in Snohomish School District asked parents to replace globes and maps that still showed the USSR.
Multiply these stories across the state.
What is McCleary? What does it mean to fully fund basic education? To learn more about the Supreme Court’s McCleary decision and what has happened since the 2012 ruling, go to: projects.seattletimes.com/2016/education-funding/
Washington public schools are rife with inequities, from teacher salaries to computers to local levies.
Generous taxpayers in Everett have OK’d local levies that pay some of the highest teacher salaries in the nation — $66,457 for a midcareer teacher without a master’s degree or board certification during the 2014-15 school year. Meanwhile, in less affluent Yakima, a Central Washington city where incomes, land and property values are lower, a midcareer teacher earned $49,163.
Bellevue School District voters approved technology levies in 2010 and 2014 to pay for laptops and computer equipment. Meanwhile, in some school districts like Bridgeport and Trout Lake, the computers are so outdated most students take the new computer adaptive statewide tests with pencils and paper.
Because the state has failed to fully pay the cost of basic education, local communities have made up the shortfall in whatever ways they can. Some districts have the property values to enable them to tax their way to success. Others have scrambled for money with wrapping-paper sales and putting school children to work on crafts to sell. These efforts have done nothing to fix the inequities in the system, and in some cases have only made them worse.
When the justices and representatives of the governor and Legislature convene in the Temple of Justice Wednesday, they should keep one goal in mind: Ensure all Washington students’ right to fairness and equity in their education, whether they live in Chimacum or Yakima or Bellevue, is fulfilled.
Time is up: Supreme Court must increase pressure
WASHINGTON’S Supreme Court justices should ratchet up the pressure on lawmakers to finish their work to fully fund basic education. That includes reforming the way the state pays for public schools and ensuring better outcomes for students.
Frustrated with progress in 2014, the high court held the state in contempt of court over lack of progress in fulfilling its orders around the McCleary decision on education funding. The court delayed penalties to allow the Legislature to make progress during its 2015 session. Still disappointed in August 2015, the court tried to turn up the pressure by imposing a fine of $100,000 a day.
The Legislature all but shrugged, not even appropriating money for the fine in the state budget. What they did do was enact a disappointing bipartisan “plan for a plan” to solve the problem next year.
The fine was a misfire, and the court should abandon it.
However, the justices’ demands are not a misfire. They embody the urgency of solving Washington state’s underfunding of K-12 education. The system, over decades, has led to unjust and unequal education for students across the state.
The justices’ next order must carry directions and a threat of penalties lawmakers and the governor won’t be able to ignore.
First, the court should not give lawmakers any additional time to finish their work.
Previous court orders already told lawmakers the 2017 session, which convenes in January, is their last chance to fix the way the state pays for public schools.
But Attorney General Bob Ferguson, in defense of the state, argued in a recent brief that lawmakers have until September 2018 to finish their McCleary work.
The lawyer representing the coalition of school districts, teachers and community groups that sued the state over education funding argues the deadline is September 2017.
Lawmakers must finish their work during the 2017 legislative session. Otherwise, any changes in the state tax system, whether levy reform or new taxes, likely would not go into effect by 2018.
Second, the court should set out concrete penalties that maximize the pressure on the Legislature and governor while causing the least disruption for the state’s students, who are already in a system that leaves too many behind.
The McCleary plaintiffs have proposed a number of possible Supreme Court sanctions, including:
Declare the state budget unconstitutional and call lawmakers back to Olympia to try again.
Rewrite the state budget and strike down as unconstitutional all tax exemptions passed by the Legislature.
Shut down schools until lawmakers can reach an agreement. That should be the last resort because it could harm kids. However, in New Jersey, the Legislature resolved a similar education-funding standoff eight days after its Supreme Court shut down schools.
Another possibility is for the court to appoint a special master who will engage directly with lawmakers and the governor to goad them to quicker action — and report to the court directly with more intimate insights into the obstacles to resolution.
Time is up. Washington’s 1.1 million students can wait no longer.

“This class is about breaking rules,” says Ahmad Sawalmeh, the fresh-from-teacher-training yogi who’s leading tonight’s vinyasa flow class. “If you feel like doing a headstand while the rest of us are in down dog, go for it.”
The class’s theme is fitting, because Tonia Crosby has been breaking all the rules typically associated with Western yoga since she founded bhavana-collective in this building in the Cole neighborhood last year.
Accessibility: that’s one of her new rules. Since the first yoga studio was introduced in this country in the ’70s, yoga has grown to be a $27 billion industry. But Crosby eschews the $150 yoga pants in favor of letting those who can’t afford to practice elsewhere come to bhavana-collective for reduced-price — or even free — classes.
“Our campaigns don't utilize westernized images of the perfect yoga body and posture." Facebook

She breaks traditional marketing rules, too, forgoing the popular imagery found at many American yoga studios. “Our campaigns don’t utilize Westernized images of the perfect yoga body and posture; we use images of real people who actually practice at the collective,” Crosby points out. Adds bhavana-collective teacher Sarah Lyons, “A lot of studios say everyone’s welcome, but when you look at the imagery on their posters, many people don’t see themselves represented.”
And the most significant way that Crosby has parted from tradition is in breaking the first rule of real estate: location, location, location! Crosby wants to serve the underserved; the Cole neighborhood is one of the most diverse in the city, with a demographic almost equally divided between Latino, African-American and white residents — many of them close to the poverty level. “It wouldn’t have occurred to me to open shop in a bourgeois neighborhood,” she says, “because that isn’t my style.”
Breaking rules creates challenges for a new business, and now bhavana-collective faces the biggest challenge of all: Crosby has had to leave Colorado to take care of her dying mother in Nebraska. But her teachers and students have stepped up to help, and are giving the yogi a lesson in the real meaning of community.
Tonia Crosby, who greets acquaintances and strangers alike with the salutation “Namaste, friend,” has long brown hair, bright eyes and a humble energy that’s nothing short of remarkable. With her tender appearance and wayward spirit, she doesn’t look or talk like the popular image of a revolutionary — but that’s what she is.
She grew up with her parents and sisters in Castle Rock, back “when Castle Rock was still a small town,” Crosby says, and her first memory is of a vacation in the mountains. Her dad had set her up with a pole at the edge of a lake, and Crosby was ecstatic when she caught her first trout — until the flailing thing tipped her off balance and pulled all thirty-odd pounds of her into the water. “I remember Dad scooping me out of the water, holding me up in the sky; I was so embarrassed at first,” Crosby recalls. “And then I looked around and realized my dad wasn’t mad — he was laughing.”
That’s one of Crosby’s better memories. “Mine wasn’t the prettiest childhood,” she admits. “Dad experienced a lot of trauma in Vietnam, and then he died when I was nine. That made our lives intense.”
Left to support the family alone, Crosby’s mother moved her children to a farm in Kiowa. They spent summers in Nebraska, on their grandfather’s massive cattle, corn and alfalfa ranch. When Crosby wasn’t developing her work ethic as a farmhand, she played softball, competing nationally in high school.
She started college in Greeley before transferring to what is now Metropolitan State University of Denver, and from there it was “Los Angeles for a bit, Southeast Asia, Peru, Costa Rica, and all over Central America,” Crosby says. “I’ve lived all over the world, but Denver was always my home base.” She lived in San Diego, too, while working on a master’s degree in Peace and Justice Studies, and it was her thesis for that program that first took her to India in 2010.

Crosby was staying in northern Goa, collecting ethnographic information on women in marginalized communities and their access to online social movements when, during her fifth month abroad, she found a lump in her breast. After she returned to California to finish her thesis, she was diagnosed with stage IIB breast cancer. “It became stage IV cancer when it metastasized into my lymphatic system, which means it is incurable,” Crosby says. She moved back to Colorado to live with her sister in Parker and begin treatment. After three surgeries, Crosby refused any chemotherapy but agreed to join a targeted radiation clinical trial at the University of Colorado hospital.
“I felt like I was getting sicker,” Crosby remembers. “I knew I’d die if I didn’t leave. I was depressed beyond belief, and scared.” When two unacquainted friends both recommended a Tibetan physician in San Diego, Crosby called the doctor. Ten days later, she hopped on a plane and headed to Dr. Lobsang Dhondup’s office — mere blocks from the apartment she’d leased while studying in San Diego.
Crosby worked with Dhondup for two years, spending upwards of $500 every month to fly to California to see the physician who’d dubbed her “Wind Woman” for her nomadic spirit. But then on one appointment, Dhondup told her: “Okay, Wind Woman, it’s time for you to go and be a wind woman. I don’t need to see you again.”
“It was a shock, and I was crushed,” she remembers. “I couldn’t believe he was sending me away.” Her doctor might have discharged her, but Crosby says she wasn’t exactly cured: “I will live with cancer my whole life; it will always exist in my body in one form or another. It just isn’t dangerous as long as I’m taking care of myself.” Working with Dhondup, she explains, “shifted my entire perspective.”
She’d already drastically changed her diet; now she changed how she regarded exercise. “I’d practiced yoga for a nice ass-ana for a decade before I was diagnosed because I wanted to look good,” Crosby says. A marathon runner, she’d always thought she lived a healthy lifestyle, but Dhondup had set her straight. “He told me running was too stressful on my body, that I needed to learn to rest,” she remembers. “He said what I needed to do instead was find meditative movement for exercise, and that’s when I really started doing yoga.”
Cancer completely changed the trajectory of Crosby’s life. She’d been pursuing a career in international nonprofit humanitarian work because she thought she could make the most impact in a position of power. But she’d grown increasingly frustrated by how little impact big organizations seemed to have, “especially for people on the ground, who really need it.”
In 2013, Crosby quit her job as general manager at Hapa Sushi in Cherry Creek and returned to India — this time for yoga teacher training in the Ashtanga tradition at a school in a tiny town in southern Goa, a seaside Portuguese colony where Catholics and Hindus intermingle. She lived on the top floor of an old house with marble floors and wrought-iron-framed windows overlooking a cashew orchard on a hill leading down to the water; Crosby could smell the family below cooking curries while neighborhood dogs barked nonstop. “There was a Catholic school the equivalent of a couple of blocks from my apartment, and the kids came out every morning to sing hymns in the yard, and I listened while I drank my coffee,” she remembers. “I have this knack for finding spaces that are really cool.”
In India, Crosby got her strength back. When she wasn’t swimming in the Arabian Sea, riding a scooter through town or drinking milk from the cow a few houses down, she studied under several teachers, including Keshava Murthy, a “very mischievous, goofy little Indian man who was always making jokes but had these amazing insights into the world,” she says.
After 32 days of comprehensive yoga training, Crosby snagged a job at the school where she’d studied and started up a private practice. She finally felt like she was affecting others in profound ways and had “connected.” So she was totally unprepared when, after she described a dream to Murthy, he suggested it was time for her to move back to the United States. “Once again, I was crushed,” she says.
For weeks, Tonia Crosby had been dreaming about a brick wall. After leaving India, she landed in New York, and “I started looking for bricks in Brooklyn because it has a lot of brick buildings,” she remembers. “Nothing felt right, and I really missed my family. I just needed to go home.”
But back in Denver, Crosby felt “out of sorts,” she says. “I didn’t have any money; I was totally down and out.” Crosby’s sister and her best friend took turns supporting her. “I couldn’t get my shit together,” she admits. “I was back waiting tables, and it didn’t feel right. That’s when I started writing my business plan for the collective.”
In India, Crosby hadn’t just dreamed about brick walls. During her waking hours, she’d thought about starting a yoga collective, a place that would be open to all. And she’d brought that dream back to Denver with her.
“One day I was sitting in a coffee shop in RiNo looking on Craigslist,” she remembers, “and I saw an ad for this place in Cole.” The picture posted online was weird, and the place “looked like shit.” But fifteen minutes later, she was at the building at 37th Avenue and Franklin Street, and when the landlord opened the front door, she found herself staring at fifteen-foot-high brick walls. “I knew this was it,” she says.
The turn-of-the-last-century, L-shaped storefront had at various times housed a theater, a bar and a brothel. Crosby thought it would be a perfect yoga studio — a traditional shala like those in India, where a teacher lives in the yoga space — and she signed a lease for a portion of the building last May. “I was broke, and it was scary,” she says. “Still, money’s never been one of those things that keeps me from doing what I do. I always find a way.”
At first, that way was hard work. The property was littered with old cans of beans and cat food and pornographic videos, and it took her about $15,000 and two months of cleaning, scrubbing, painting, tiling and adding new windows to get the place ready for its (rather anti-climactic) grand opening. “It was all me in the beginning,” Crosby says. “There was no community then.”
Thanks to Crosby’s handiwork, bhavana-collective’s cheerful red doors now lead visitors past a string of Tibetan prayer flags into a sunny studio with wood floors, 3-D local art, rows of books and spare mats, blocks and straps.
Crosby built up her business by pounding the pavement. She went to every hyper-local coffee shop, school and restaurant she could think of to talk about the collective. She visited studios around town — “I’m a yoga whore, and I take classes all over the city” — and mentioned her plans. And she spent hours sitting on her front porch, waiting for people to walk by. “I also began taking private clients and was impressing people with that,” she adds. “And I fucking prayed — a lot.”
The students started rolling in.
From the start, Crosby wanted to make yoga accessible, “and I’ll walk away before that changes,” she says. She offered $10 drop-in classes, with the option of a ten-class, $90 package; nearly a year later, those prices are unchanged.
“Yoga’s caught a rap as being elitist and for suburban moms in Lululemon,” says bhavana-collective student Frank Moya, an attorney who has been coming from Lowry to practice with Crosby since meeting her while the two were practicing at Kindness Yoga Studio. “Tonia’s objective is to make yoga available to all.”
“Tonia is so earnest,” says Sarah Lyons, who’s been teaching at bhavana-collective from the start. “She’s genuine and welcoming and unafraid. She is one of the most courageous people I’ve met. Everyone experiences fear, and I know Tonia does, too. But she walks through that fear so gracefully.
“There’s plenty of yoga available for the regular population in Denver,” Lyons continues, adding that bhavana-collective caters to folks who “are seeking something more than just a workout. A lot of people are under- or unemployed and can’t afford a $16 to $20 drop-in class. People should be able to practice yoga without worrying about money.”
Bhavana-collective’s teachers are another point of distinction. “The way Tonia hires is wonderful,” says Crosby’s second cousin, Cindy Kochis, a regular. Prospective teachers are asked to do a community audition; after the class, students give their input by rating the instructor’s performance, and Crosby hires based on those reviews.
Since bhavana-collective opened last July, 375 people have walked through the doors; about sixty are now regulars. “I’d never done yoga before, and I’m not your regular yoga type,” says Kochis. “I’m a bigger person, and I always felt intimidated because I’m not a young, skinny blond girl.”
From her home in Littleton, it takes Kochis over half an hour to get to bhavana-collective. “It’s worth it every time,” she says. “Before I started yoga, I didn’t even like driving on the highway. I was so body-conscious. Working with Tonia, I’ve lost my fear and stepped outside of my comfort zone in some pretty major ways.”
Bhavana-collective is a diverse, inclusive studio for folks of “all income levels, races, ethnicities, shapes, colors and sexual orientations,” Kochis says. “Tonia makes everyone feel comfortable and included there. That’s the beautiful thing, really.”
That’s the thing that attracted Lyons. “Yoga didn’t just change my life, it saved my life,” she says. She’d practiced on and off throughout her twenties for exercise, but didn’t tap into the spiritual aspect of yoga until four years ago. “I was struggling with addiction and was totally disconnected from my body,” Lyons recalls. “I got sober, and at the time, I didn’t use a twelve-step program; that’s when yoga really clicked for me.”
Lyons got certified as a yoga teacher and brought Indianapolis-based Y12SR — Yoga for 12-Step Recovery — to Denver. She now offers the free class at bhavana-collective every second Thursday; the workshop begins with a 45-minute AA meeting, followed by a flow class. “When I started teaching Y12SR, I decided I should join a twelve-step program,” Lyons says. “It’s weird how one path leads to another.”
Lyons’s other gig is teaching Denver Queer & Trans Yoga. “Why’s that a thing?” she asks, then provides the answer: Walking into a mainstream yoga studio can be really intimidating, especially for people who don’t fit into a binary gender structure, and bathrooms are particularly tricky. “When you go to a yoga studio, you might have to use the facilities or change clothes, and not everybody feels safe in a place that doesn’t have a bathroom for them,” she explains.
Teachers at mainstream yoga studios often haven’t had diversity training, she notes, and they’re more likely to use gendered language while teaching. For example, a teacher might say that “Men tend to have really tight hips,” a comment that’s both unnecessary and false, Lyons says. Queer & Trans Yoga provides “a welcoming place where people can come and be themselves and not worry about being judged,” she adds.
Before she met Crosby, Lyons bounced around from one space to the next and was having a hard time finding a permanent home for Queer & Trans Yoga — in part because the class is donation-based. Lyons teaches the class for free, and any money collected is given to an area nonprofit of the group’s choosing.
Lyons heard about bhavana-collective last June, when Crosby was gearing up for her grand opening by advertising on social media. “I looked it up online and immediately knew it was different from a typical yoga studio,” says Lyons. She reached out to Crosby, who happily offered up rent-free space for both Y12SR and Queer & Trans Yoga, currently held at 7 p.m. every fourth Tuesday.
“It is very important to me to have space for communities that don’t have space elsewhere,” explains Crosby. “Sarah and I always keep communication open — even when it isn’t easy, even when there isn’t a resolution.”
Adds Lyons, “Tonia’s willing to educate herself, and she’s willing to go there to engage with people in a way that lets them know she’s truly an ally.”
The Cole neighborhood could use some allies these days. The area has been under scrutiny lately because of gang violence. Two weeks ago, 22-year-old Nolan Ware was gunned down outside a local church after his uncle’s funeral.
Bhavana-collective is currently the only yoga studio in the neighborhood. “Cole is across the tracks,” Crosby explains. “It’s this rough little neighborhood that people don’t know about yet — but they’re about to know.” That’s because the light-rail stop at 38th and Blake streets, part of the East Rail Line, is scheduled to open in 2016, opening up access to this area northwest of City Park. But in the meantime, Crosby notes, “Cole is the only place where people can still afford houses in Denver.”
Councilman Albus Brooks, who represents the district, has lived in Cole for eight years; he’s even a client of Crosby’s. “We’re very much aware of the gangs,” says Brooks. “The biggest challenge is that we have rival Latino and African-American gangs living literally a block away from each other.”
“I have this knack for finding spaces that are really cool." Facebook

The city has expanded police presence in the neighborhood and is working on intervention programs, “to help young people come out of this lifestyle,” he says. But community-building is also pivotal. “The most safe communities are the engaged communities,” Brooks notes. “What gets us talking and connecting is assets — places where neighbors can come together. And one of our current assets is the yoga studio.”
“I’ve never had an ounce of trouble,” Crosby says of the neighborhood. “There are great folks in the area who have been working tirelessly for a long time to mitigate the violence and heal the community, and I hope to be one of those folks moving forward.”
She’s tried to attract more Cole residents to the collective. “There is a group of Latino women who come for the Friday beginner class,” Crosby says. “Only a few other people of color in the neighborhood come regularly for class.”
Price is one of the obstacles. “I’d already been giving yoga to people who couldn’t afford it, and then Cindy had her idea,” Crosby remembers. Last Christmas, her second cousin wanted to do something charitable. When Crosby mentioned that some folks in the neighborhood were interested in yoga but couldn’t afford it, Kochis and a few friends donated free classes.
After Crosby thanked Kochis publicly, others wanted to donate, too. Now whenever somebody wants to practice yoga but doesn’t have the cash, Crosby draws on a growing pool of donated free-class cards. She’s hoping to eventually establish a streamlined application process for would-be students — like one who recently lost her job but was able to continue yoga while job-hunting thanks to the informal scholarship program. So far, Crosby has handed out 170 free classes, and she plans to engage area nonprofits like Urban Peak and the Denver Center for Crime Victims, among others.
Given her goals, Crosby could probably structure her business as a nonprofit; instead, she’s gone the for-profit route. “I really believe we live in a world where I can make a living and keep a business open that’s purposeful,” she says. “I want to believe people will show up and we can make this thing succeed.”
Crosby’s kept her place going by running a private yoga and energy-healing practice and, until about two months ago, waiting tables at Hapa Sushi’s Landmark location. “After the bills are paid at the end of the month, I pay myself as much of a salary as possible,” Crosby says. In February, she took her first paycheck from bhavana-collective: just shy of $600.
“Her generosity inspires others to be generous,” says Lyons. On March 20, Crosby opened up her studio for a blowout Spring Equinox party, at which she introduced three new instructors — Ahmad Sawalmeh included — and raised a couple hundred bucks for the yoga scholarship fund.
Just days later, she learned that her mother had terminal lung cancer.
Fifteen years ago, Crosby’s mother had moved back to the family ranch in Nebraska when her own father was diagnosed with lung cancer. For years, Crosby and her mother had been trying to fix their relationship, which had been rocky since Crosby was a teen; now it was suddenly clear to her that if she wanted to resolve any remaining issues, she’d have to relocate to Nebraska for the short term.
But how would the collective keep going? “My private practice is the breadwinner for the collective,” Crosby says, “and so I launched a GoFundMe campaign to keep the studio alive while I’m gone.” In the first month, the collective received over sixty individual donations totaling nearly $4,000, and it wasn’t just locals pitching in. “People from all over the world have donated, from London to India, Singapore and Peru,” Crosby says. “Here’s the cool thing: It’s an amazing pay-it-forward opportunity.”
Unfortunately, what the campaign has collected so far is just enough to keep the lights on for another month or two, tops.
“It is very important to me to have space for communities that don't have space elsewhere." Facebook

Crosby’s supporters are just getting started, though. “You can just feel the community coming together around her and the space,” says Lyons. The help isn’t just coming in the form of cash. Sawalmeh has become the caretaker for the collective and lives in the back apartment that Crosby had created for herself at the studio; Lyons is the unofficial PR point person. Together they’ve joined forces to keep Crosby’s vision going. Students, too, have rallied.
“We don’t know how long I’ll be in Nebraska,” admits Crosby. “I started asking myself those questions: What happens if I can’t keep the center open? But then I realized if I worry, I’m phony and not practicing what I tell everyone else.”
Lyons says she’ll do anything for the space — and for Crosby. “If bhavana doesn’t make it, that’s not the end of Tonia, that’s just the end of this chapter,” she adds. “Whatever else she does, if it comes to that, will be amazing, and I want to be part of that. She has so much passion; it’s infectious.”
“We’re going to keep going as long as we can,” Crosby says, “knowing our intentions are good and hoping the universe sustains us.”
For now, Crosby’s plan is to put her faith in the community she’s created and nurtured. “I have aspirations for the whole building someday, with a cafe, hostel and yoga,” she says. “It’s so important that it’s clear that this isn’t about me. It’s about all of the amazing people who come to the studio; none of this is worth anything without them. They’ve given me the ability to be with my mother right now, which is probably the biggest gift I’ve ever received.”
But while it may take a lot of incredible individuals to form a one-of-a-kind village like bhavana-collective, as Kochis puts it, “Tonia’s what brings everything together; she’s the heart and she’s the soul.”

What Is Ripple Coin?
“Ripple coin” is an unofficial reference to the native currency of “Ripple,” an open payments network that enables reliable cross-border currency transfers.
What Does “XRP” Stand For?
“XRP” is the official name of Ripple’s native currency. It is used on the “xRapid” software as a means of near-instant liquidity for cross-border payments. Three of the five biggest money transfer companies have launched pilot programs using XRP.
To read about why banks might eventually use XRP, go here.
How Much Is Ripple Worth?
As of February 15, 2018, the Ripple price was around $1.12, the circulating supply was around 39 billion coins, the total volume exchanged was around $1.63 billion, and the market cap was around $43.7 billion.

What Is the Ripple Payment Protocol?
The Ripple Payment Protocol, also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP), is a remittance network, a real-time gross settlement system, and a currency exchange. The network is built upon a consensus ledger, a distributed open source Internet protocol, and the native cryptocurrency.
This protocol allows Ripple to settle cross-border transactions in a matter of seconds. Although the protocol is generalized around value—meaning that it can send currency, commodities, or even frequent-flier miles—the company has focused on applying the Ripple protocol to the problem of international wire transfers.
How Does Ripple Work?
Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), which works on a public blockchain, Ripple works with a network of participating banks and financial institutions called “nodes.” Ripple works like the ancient “hawala network,” which was used to send money from city to city.
Let’s say “A” in the U.S. wants to send money to “B” in India. A goes to the local bank and gets some USD and a password. A’s bank contacts B’s local bank in India and tells it to release funds on receipt of a password. B gives the password and receives the equivalent amount of USD in rupees. Either of the two banks can take commissions.
Is Ripple Open Source?
In 2013, Stefan Thomas, the CTO of Ripple Labs, announced that as of September 26 of that year, the source code for the peer-to-peer node behind the Ripple payment network was officially open source. The release of “Rippled,” a peer-to-peer “full node,” ensured that the Ripple community would have the entire suite of tools needed to maintain the network on its own. (Source: “Ripple is Officially Open Source,” Bitcoin Magazine, September 26, 2013.)
Will Ripple Replace SWIFT? How Is Ripple Different from SWIFT?
SWIFT’s current cross-border payments are slow, expensive, and opaque. The payments go through the 600-year-old correspondent banking system facilitated by SWIFT.
This system requires the involvement of six players: the payer, the payer’s bank, the payer’s bank’s correspondent, the beneficiary bank’s correspondent, the beneficiary bank, and the beneficiary.
Since the messages generally flow sequentially, the process takes some time. To make matters worse, banks got into the habit of doing nothing with the money for great lengths of time, calling it a float. Even worse, the banks also help themselves to arbitrary deductions, simply changing the name to throw people off.
Ripple disrupted the current model of cross-border payments via its sub-second cross-border payments and very transparent automated best pricing via its own network. Regulators should prefer Ripple because near-instant transfers vastly reduce both credit risks and liquidity.
Although it only takes seconds, the Ripple process assures users of the best price, since it includes an information-rich exchange and implements an automated instant auction for FX and liquidity provision.
Given these advantages, it’s just a matter of time before Ripple displaces SWIFT. However, SWIFT has launched its Global Payments Innovation Initiative (GPII) to counter the growing threat from Ripple.
GPII improves upon the current SWIFT messaging and correspondent banking with payment tracking and other data that enforce banks to remain on their best behavior when it comes to cross-border payments.

Ripple Mining: Is It Possible to Mine Ripple?
Many popular cryptocurrencies rely on mining to add to the monetary base. However, there is no Ripple mining as the maximum supply of 100 billion Ripple already exists.
Of the 100 billion Ripple, the founders of Ripple Labs have kept 20 billion and contributed the other 80 billion to the business. There are currently 39 billion Ripple in circulation (as of February 15) and Ripple has placed 55 billion in an escrow account.
At the current average distribution of about 300 million Ripple per month over the past 18 months, Ripple believes it would take 14 to 18 years to go through all 55 billion Ripple in escrow.
How Can I Invest in Ripple?
All you need to do to invest in Ripple is follow four simple steps, which you can find here.
Is Ripple Available on Coinbase?
Ripple is not yet available on Coinbase, at least for investors looking to buy XRP straight from USD. Only Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are available directly from Coinbase.
What Is the Best Ripple Exchange?
Below are five of the best Ripple exchanges, based on user reviews and a host of other criteria, such as accessibility, fees, user-friendliness, and safety.
Kraken: This exchange is good for more experienced traders. Today, it is the largest Bitcoin exchange in euro volume and liquidity. For more experienced users, Kraken offers margin trading and many other trading features. Poloniex: Founded in 2014, Poloniex has established itself very well and is now among the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, with the highest trading volumes. One of the unique tools on Poloniex is the chat box, which is continuously filled with user help. Bitstamp: Founded in 2011, this European Union (EU)-based Bitcoin exchange has built up quite a reputation in the cryptocurrency community as a trusted and secure exchange. Changelly: Changelly is a cryptocurrency exchange web site founded in 2013. Soon after its launch, it introduced an option that allows people to buy Ripple coin or any other cryptocurrency by paying with credit or debit cards. Coinbase: Although you can’t buy XRP directly on Coinbase, I added it to the list because it is arguably one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It is backed by trusted investors and used by millions of customers across the globe, making it a safe option. The normally low fees on Coinbase would be heightened by having to pass through Bitcoin, but that might be a trade-off you’re willing to make. It’s a matter of cost versus credibility.
XRP Exchange Comparison Chart
Name of Exchange Country Spread Payment Options 24/7 Support Easy Interface? Fees Kraken Good Limited Very Good No Low Poloniex Limited Good Poor Yes Low Bitstamp Good Limited Good No Low Changelly Limited Limited Good Yes High For the pros and cons of each of the above exchanges, go here.
How Can I Buy Ripple with PayPal?
It is not possible to directly buy Ripple with “PayPal.” Your only option is to first buy Bitcoin with PayPal. Once you have BTC, you can use an exchange like Binance to convert BTC to Ripple.
How Can I Buy Ripple with a Credit Card?
Changelly is one of the few places where investors can buy Ripple using a credit card. At most other exchanges, you will first have to buy ETH or BTC with your credit card. Once you have the BTC or ETH, you can convert it into Ripple in about 10 minutes on an exchange like Binance. However, many credit cards are discontinuing their relationships with exchanges, meaning that it may become impossible to process these transactions at all.
Best Ripple Wallet: Which Wallet Should I Use for XRP?
Since most investors are likely to stick to a single wallet address rather than have multiple XRP wallet addresses, it’s a good idea to understand your long-term requirements first and select the best Ripple wallet for your requirements from the following wallets.
Gatehub
“Gatehub” is the official online wallet of Ripple. The wallet has a great user interface. Another feature is that Gatehub.net allows you to check real-time stats and market trends before any XRP transaction.
Poloniex
Poloniex is a great exchange on which to trade cryptocurrencies. Not only can you buy XRP by exchanging your BTC or ETH (or other currencies), you can store XRP on Poloniex.
CoinPayments
CoinPayments is more than just a wallet. It offers an easy payment gateway for merchants to accept payments in cryptocurrencies. The merchants also have access to a very safe and secure wallet where they can easily store their XRP for a small period.
Rippex
Among the available desktop wallets, “Rippex” is the most trusted and easy way to store your XRP. The Rippex app can easily be downloaded on “Windows,” “Linux,” or “Mac.”
Ledger Nano S
The “Ledger Nano S” is the finest hardware wallet your dollar can buy. It offers top-notch security to store your coins for long periods without hassle. The Ledger Nano S hardware wallet has recently added support for Ripple.
How Many Businesses Have Adopted Ripple?
Ripple has signed up many financial institutions to its blockchain network, bringing its clientele to more than 100. Moreover, its distributed ledger network, “RippleNet,” has been joined by United Arab Emirates (UAE) lender RAKBANK and U.K. currency exchange firm IFX. It has also signed up with South American online payment provider dLocal.
Cuallix, one of Ripple’s new corporate customers, will be the first institution to trial Ripple’s cryptocurrency. By using Ripple’s virtual currency, Cuallix hopes to lower the cost of payments from the U.S. to Mexico.
And now big-name clients including Banco Santander, S.A. (BME:SAN), UniCredit SpA (BIT:UCG), UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS), Standard Chartered PLC (LON:STAN), and Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (TYO:8306) are also keen to join hands with Ripple.
Is Ripple Secure?
The simple answer to the question “Is Ripple secure” is “Yes.” That’s because Ripple’s strategy is different from other players in the cryptocurrency market. Think of Ripple as the tortoise in the story “The Tortoise and the Hare.” Ripple knows its goal. And once it gets there, it could dominate the online payment market.
XRP Predictions
With major banks and financial institutions buying into the idea of RippleNet and embracing XRP, 2017 proved to be a big year for Ripple. This augurs well for XRP’s potential value.
If Ripple can continue to expedite the process of adoption and make XRP acceptable at retail outlets, it would be a huge leap. And when it does happen, XRP’s potential value will be truly perceived.

MUMBAI — Bollywood has a long history of portraying gay characters with clichés or using them as an ostensibly comic sideshow. Often they are sexual predators whom the male leads, epitomes of heterosexual masculinity, must be wary of.
But several recent movies have challenged those stereotypes, suggesting that attitudes in India’s movie industry, or at least within an influential section of it, may be changing.
“Aligarh,” based on the true story of a gay professor who was hounded, possibly to death, opened nationwide in India in February to critical acclaim. (On May 14 the movie will be the closing offering at the New York Indian Film Festival.) It features mainstream actors — with Manoj Bajpayee in the lead role — a casting approach without precedent in Bollywood and unthinkable just a few years ago.
“Aligarh” was followed in March by “Kapoor & Sons,” a multistar big-budget Bollywood movie in which one of the two male leads is revealed to be gay. A tale of messy family relationships inspired by Woody Allen’s “Hannah and Her Sisters,” the film surpassed roughly $16 million in revenues, the Bollywood gold standard for commercial success.

El problema de la rentabilidad
Existe una crisis real de rentabilidad en el sector agropecuario nacional. ¿Por qué esta es diferente a las anteriores? ¿Cuál es la salida?
El contexto previo
Uruguay, junto con los otros tres países fundacionales del Mercosur, conforma una de las principales regiones proveedoras mundiales de alimentos y materias primas agropecuarias, donde se radican importantes niveles de inversiones extranjeras directas. Si la situación es tan promisoria, ¿cómo se pudo llegar a una situación complicada en la rentabilidad de la mayoría de las actividades agropecuarias?
El primer rasgo es que en este caso se registraron importantes cambios en la base agropecuaria de la producción. Estos se expresaron, desde la salida de la crisis de 2002 hasta 2013, en aumentos en los niveles de productividad total de factores en la producción agropecuaria y en un estancamiento posterior, lo que coincide con el inicio de los problemas actuales. En este período se registraron cambios en la forma de producir y nuevas inversiones, se incorporaron nuevos agentes que invirtieron en tierras, se registraron nuevas formas de gestionar y financiar el negocio agropecuario, etcétera. Paralelamente, fue el período de mayor reducción en el número de agricultores familiares en la comparación inter censos agropecuarios.
El segundo aspecto, derivado del anterior, es que esta crisis de rentabilidad, que empezó a configurarse a partir del año 2015 pero varía según los sectores de actividad, impactó sobre un sector que tenía nuevos agentes, era más heterogéneo y operaba en los sectores más capitalizados con una operativa más ágil y de movilidad regional no sólo nacional.
El tercer factor es que las trayectorias tecnológicas que se implementaron en los sectores más dinámicos implicaron no sólo mayores costos de producción, que explicaron mayores niveles de productividad, sino también mayores efectos multiplicadores de la actividad económica. Ello está asociado a un mayor financiamiento, y con la reversión del ciclo de precios comenzó un período de mayor fragilidad financiera, según los sectores de actividad productiva y los tipos de productores.
¿Qué desencadenó la crisis?
i) Los precios internacionales de productos y materias primas agropecuarias registraron un muy importante aumento a nivel internacional luego de la crisis de 2002/2003 y hasta 2013/2014, seguido de una caída abrupta hasta 2016 y una muy leve recuperación en 2017.
ii) En enero de 2016 el tipo de cambio nominal promedio fue de 30,8 pesos uruguayos por dólar y se esperaba que al cierre del año se encontrara en un valor cercano a 35 pesos por dólar. Todas las estimaciones (públicas y privadas) erraron y la tónica clave fue la gran incertidumbre, que se mantiene hasta el presente.
iii) La otra parte del problema es el estancamiento en los niveles de productividad agropecuaria, asociado a los cambios reseñados. En las estimaciones disponibles hubo un aumento en los niveles agregados del indicador hasta 2013 y un notorio estancamiento posterior.
¿Cómo se sale de esto?
Históricamente, los países que están especializados internacionalmente en la exportación de bienes agropecuarios y agroindustriales de primera transformación son considerados países que tienen una estructura económica poco diversificada y condenada al subdesarrollo: la llamada “maldición de los recursos naturales”. Sin embargo, países como Nueva Zelanda, Australia, Finlandia y Canadá desmienten esto.
El enfoque en este caso es de economía política. Este gana una especial relevancia, ya que es necesario que los hacedores de política sean capaces de implementar las políticas y evaluar sus resultados con autonomía de las presiones sectoriales y los esfuerzos de algunos agentes por cooptarlas.
La llamada “trampa del ingreso medio” es en gran medida una trampa política, y no económica. Según estos autores, cuando durante el propio proceso de crecimiento se fortalecieron coaliciones con bajo compromiso con la innovación (empresas transnacionales del agronegocio que no invierten en I+D local ni en capacitación personal local, empresas nacionales que se concentran en sectores no transables protegidos de la competencia internacional; mercados de trabajo con bajos niveles de cooperación entre capital y trabajo; empresas públicas que manejan irresponsablemente recursos de la sociedad y recargan tarifas), se configuró una trampa de economía política de la que es más difícil salir. A esta trampa se suma la creciente barrera (tecnológica e institucional) que deviene del rápido movimiento de la frontera tecnológica internacional.
De la crisis de rentabilidad actual del sector agropecuario se puede salir sólo si se reconoce que existe un problema de economía política y que son necesarias acciones para no caer en la trampa del ingreso medio.

Principles of Project Management
By The Maritime Executive 2011-07-13 17:46:02
By: Louis Lemos
Ship Repair Contract Administration - For ship repair contracts covering Government-owned (or leased) vessels, it is customary to assign a Contracting Officer along with a Port Engineer to manage the Shipyard Contract, especially if it involves a major overhaul or conversion project. However, within the Ship Repair industry most Contracting Officers are qualified in business administration and to some degree, in basic accounting, but invariably, without any experience in engineering. As such, their ability to administer a major ship overhaul or conversion contract, is limited and contingent upon the effectiveness of the designated Port Engineer acting in a surrogate capacity on their behalf. Accordingly, the primary functions of the Port Engineer during a typical shipyard contract usually include but may not be limited to the following:
* Monitor progress of industrial production.
* Ensure Contractor compliance with the Specification Work Package.
* Monitor Contractor's interpretation of the Work Package.
* Coordinate with vessel Master and Chief Engineer on contract-related matters.
* Attend shipyard production meetings.
* Report project progress to Contracting Officer or Head Office, at least weekly.
* Witness operational testing of equipment and machinery by Contractor.
* Coordinate with Regulatory Body Representatives.
* Monitor scheduled arrival of Ship-owner-Furnished material.
* Negotiate with Contractor on emergent changes to the contract.
* Supervise Assistant Port Engineers, if any.
The above listed functions are typical of those performed by contemporary Project Managers, differing somewhat from the conventional routines of traditional business managers. The term "Project Management" can be traced back to the development of the U.S. Ballistic Missile Program in the early 1960's and represents a departure from the conventional line-staff concept and subsequent displacement of same by the growing trend toward a functional teamwork approach. Accordingly, the Project Manager generally operates independently of the parent organization's normal chain of command, under what might be described as "Autonomous Hierarchy". When required, the Project Manager usually negotiates directly for support from functional elements within the parent organization, often crossing functional lines and bypassing the chain of command as warranted. The Project Managers responsibilities may range from a coordinating function to that of a task force leader but regardless of title, his primary purpose is to act as the single focal point of contact for integrating, synchronizing and expediting an organizational effort toward attainment of project objectives. There is a philoso- phic conflict between the relatively passive "eight-to-five" attitude of Home Office bureaucracy on the one hand and the Project Manager's "round-the-clock" dynamic vigilance, on the other hand. This is due to the fact that the functional elements, of which there may be several within the Head Office, are only required to perform their respective daily tasks on a repetitive basis and seemingly without regard to time constraints or schedule. Whereas the Project Manager is responsible for completing his project on time, within budget, and in full compliance with specific technical performance parameters and managerial accountability.
The Project Manager, whose duty station may be remote from the Home Office, is much more dependent upon intermittent logistic support provided by various functional 111 elements than are his counterparts based in the parent organization. In most cases the organizational life-span of the Project Manager's hyperactive domain is of finite duration and usually ends upon completion of his assigned project. Briefly, Project Management may be summarized as being governed by three fundamental factors, these are: 1 - Definition of Project Objectives. 2 - Evaluation of Resources. 3 - Judicial application of Resources to the task of accomplishing Project Objectives.
The philosophic intent may be considered to imply as a minimum, the following principles:
1) - DEFINITION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES : This involves specific identification of *The required-end-result. *The required completion/delivery date. *The estimated or negotiated total cost. *The technical performance specifications/plans to be complied with.
These factors should be spelled out clearly and approved by top management within the parent organization or corporate structure, and plainly understood by all concerned. This includes the designated Project Manager and assigned Project Team members (if any) to ensure that there is absolutely no doubt of what is expected of them.
2) - EVALUATION OF PROJECT RESOURCES: Typically, this includes available manpower, existing in-house employees, temporary personnel specifically hired for the project duration, or, dedicated contract labor to be provided by the prime and/or subcontractor for the project. The projected time-frame in terms of calendar days and contractually specified number of labor man-hours. Funding allocation for contract labor and material costs, salaries and expenses of Project Management Team members and miscellaneous project-related costs. Facilities either owned, rented or contracted for. Plans, drawings, work performance specifications and technical documentation, and related technical support such as manufacturer's representatives; plus intermittent logistic support from the Home Office and periodic meteorologic forecast reports for the duration of contract performance period.
3) APPLICATION OF PROJECT RESOURCES: This is where the Project Manager is on his own and must demonstrate the required expertise to effectively utilize available resources to maximum advantage, despite inevitable problems, for timely attainment of his ultimate objective, namely, successful completion of the project. Learning to recognize the degree of adversity he can cope with, without compromising his effectiveness, is the hallmark of an experienced Project Manager.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES - Unlike conventional business management, wherein traditional patterns and prescribed rules are the norm, project management involves a fairly constant effort to cope with known, unknown and often unpredictable variables. Since many of these variables are subject to change in nature, magnitude and frequency, efficient operational management under such conditions can be quite frustrating. This is especially true when the variables to be contended with, such as labor disputes, climatic conditions, sources of supply, civic strife, budgetary limitations, cultural conflicts, language barriers, etc., are beyond effective control of the project manager. Thus for planning purposes, it may be advisable for a prospective project manager to conduct a logistics study of the project area to identify those factors that may be conducive to or that may detract from successful accomplishment of project objectives. This is particularly applicable to projects in the international arena wherein because of its inherent dynamism, a typically American proactive operational approach may appear to conflict with the relatively passive nature and antiquated bureaucracy of certain host countries. Typical factors to be considered for the formulation of a project support plan should include but not be restricted to the following parameters:
a) - RESTRICTIONS: Business licenses or operating permits required, including visas allowing entry into a foreign country for the specific purpose of managing a ship repair or overhaul project. Government agencies having jurisdiction over, or private interests exercising influence over the proposed project area. Local ordinances or legislation covering environmental disturbances. Complications involved in clearing imported essential project parts and materials through local Customs, inevitable bureaucratic delays and potentially adverse impact upon project completion date.
b) - CLIMATIC CONDITIONS: Extremely high or low temperatures; heavy rainfall; thick fog; strong winds; high humidity; sandstorms or rough seas. Such conditions may reduce the number of available work days during a given period and may also require special protection for personnel, sensitive instruments or materials and equipment. In addition, they may pose safety hazards and cause delays in transportation.
c) LOCAL LOGISTICS: Availability of on-site transportation and frequency fair freight domestic and foreign; communications; purity of potable water; dependable power supply; consumable supplies, etc. Allowances should be made for the possible need and cost of shipping from home base or elsewhere, if not locally available. Housing, hotels, eating facilities, food supplies, medical services, recreation and entertainment.
d) - LOCAL ECONOMY: Pay rates of skilled and unskilled labor. Fees, duties and/or taxes imposed on equipment and supplies brought into the area. Certain foreign countries and states offer liberal tax exemptions and waiver of fees as inducements to projects deemed to be beneficial to the development of the national or local economy.
e) - POLITICAL STABILITY: This factor may be significant in some overseas areas where a sudden change of regime; insurgent rebel attacks or civic strife may pose a threat to the safety of project personnel and to continuity of operations. In rare cases provision may have to be made for emergency evacuation of personnel.
f)- PRODUCTIVITY: Allowances should be made on foreign projects for possible differences in the rate of individual work accomplishment compared with that of home base standards. National and religious holidays may tend to reduce the available number of work days or add to overtime costs.
g) LOCAL CUSTOMS: For ethical reasons it is advisable for project personnel to be cognizant of local or national customs, restrictions and practices, based either on religious or moral convictions, so as to minimize the transgression upon the cultural domain of the area by persons not familiar with it. Mistakes of this kind however unintentional, can sometimes cause considerable embarrassment and may even result in project activities and personnel being subject to hostile acts.
PROJECT GUIDELINES - Regardless of the magnitude of the ship repair contract in terms of relative cost, the Project Manager should always be cognizant of the fact that contract administration is not an end in itself but merely a means of supporting an end, namely, the successful attainment of project objectives - which in this case means timely completion of the ship repair or overhaul contract. The administrative function is a prime responsibility of management by means of which it provides the necessary guidance to keep the assigned project team active, productive and on a pre-determined course. It constitutes day-to-day supervision, the initiation of actions designed to keep the project team in balance with the demands made upon it and simultaneously controls the rate of expenditure of resources in fulfilling these demands. In providing direction the Project Manager must maintain a flexible posture, capable of and prepared to react to developments by issuing new or revised directives as required, including advisory policy guidance where warranted, within the scope of his assigned autonomy. To ensure a smooth flow of project management effort synchronous with the mainstream endeavor of primary objective attainment, a logistic support definition conference should be convened at the Project Manager's Home Office prior to deployment of the Ship Repair Management Team to the Shipyard Contractor's facility following notification of contract award to the successful bidder. The meeting should establish the scope of Home Office logistic support available to the Project Manager and assign responsible points of contact for coordination, implementation and follow-up. Specific areas of logistic support should be defined in writing and responsible points of contact identified along with their respective after-hours telephone numbers. These should include but not be limited to the following:
* ENGINEERING: Timely response by the Engineering Department to technical questions posed by the Project Field Team.
* CONTRACTUAL: : Timely response by the Contracting Officer (if any), to questions of a contractual nature, posed either by the Project Manager or the Shipyard Contractor.
* SUPPLY: Timely confirmation of actual shipments of Ship-Owner/Government-Furnished materials and/or parts, plus notification of any anticipated changes in delivery dates.
* ACCOUNTING: Timely response by Accounting Department to questions of funding.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES - These should range from direct involvement in the advance planning stage, to coordination of project documentation and plans, mobilization of Field Team personnel (Ship Repair Management Team), cooperating in project contracting functions, to actual on-site project management and final project close-out. During the advance planning stage the Project Manager should perform or supervise the following activities:
* Performance of all project planning, controlling, reporting and evaluation functions.
* Conduct frequent project evaluation and review meetings to identify current and future potential problems, and determine appropriate resolutions.
* Prepare and submit periodic project planning progress reports to Top Management. During the contract solicitation and procurement stage, the Project Manager should perform the following tasks:
* Ensure those responsible for procurement of project material and support services fulfill their respective responsibilities to obtain delivery of materials, equipment and services on a timely basis.
* Specify planning, scheduling and reporting requirements for major purchase orders and service contracts.
* Conduct pre-award survey of prospective contractor's facilities and prepare reports of findings for Top Management with recommendations as applicable.
Depending upon complexity and duration of the project, the Ship Repair Field Team may include a Secretary; one or more Assistant Port Engineers and a Contracting Assistant. The secretary may be an existing employee, detailed to the project team for the duration or, a temporary employee, hired by the Ship Repair Contractor for this specific purpose and assigned exclusively to the Project Manager. The secretarial function should consist of the following skills:
* Telephone Etiquette; Typing; Filing; Correspondence, Computer Operation and Mail.
* Office Management; Taking notes during production meetings; and making travel arrangements.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES - Assistant Port Engineers should be assigned to specific areas of project responsibility, such as (1) Hull, dry-dock and structural; (2) Habitability, auxiliary machinery and equipment. If a Sponsor or Charterer is involved, the Project Manager may prefer to assume responsibility for the Sponsor/Charterer related work package himself plus the Main Propulsion Plant. He should also be responsible for negotiation with the ship repair contractor on changes to existing work specifications, cancellation of specific items, growth, and totally new items plus the impact of such changes in terms of increase or reduction in man-hours and pricing.
