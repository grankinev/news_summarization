CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Thousands flocked to the streets and gathered at city hall here on Wednesday night, October 23, for an emotional welcome for the city's most illustrious son.
The remains of former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr or "Tatay Nene," as he was fondly called here, arrived at the Laguindingan Aiport late Wednesday afternoon, onboard a Philippine Air Force plane.
The Philippine Army's 4th Infantry Division gave full military honors upon the arrival of the late senator, who was city mayor from 1980 to 1984.
Mayor Oscar Moreno said the city government prepared for Pimentel's final homecoming, in anticipation of residents who want to pay their last respects to him.
"We know that many people would have like to see him and [pay tribute to] his legacy, not only in material things but his philosophy and principles," Moreno said.
Moreno has always credited Pimentel for his entry into politics. "I got from him the political virus. Tt was through him that I joined public service," he said.
"I have learned a lot from him, it is his spirit that had given me the opening [into public service], and I saw in him the nobility in public service," Moreno added.
Moreno and Pimentel became very close friends, and had a mentor-protege kind of friendship.
Press freedom defender
Veteran broadcaster Manny Jaudian, known to be Pimentel's favorite radio reporter, recalled how much the late senator supported a free press.
Jaudian said that he first met Pimentel in 1980, then Jaudian was just fresh out of high school. Like Moreno, he and Pimentel became close friends.
Jaudian said that the city held its first Press Freedom Week celebration during Pimentel's time as mayor, because he believed so much in the importance of press freedom in nation building. The late strongman Ferdinand Marcos was still in power then.
"He would often say that it is better to have a free press than to have elected officials," Jaudian said. (Nene Pimentel: Courageous stalwart of democracy)
"He loves press freedom.... Did you know that Nene was a columnist? He wrote for the defunct Mindanao Star and for the Ang Katarungan," he added.
Former mayor and congressman Constantino Jaraula, whose friendship with Pimentel began in the 1950s, recalled the tough years Pimentel endured during the Marcos regime but this did not deter him from fighting.
"Nene believes in 'he who perseveres prevails' and he was right," Jaraula said.
Jaraula also said that it was during Pimentel's time as mayor that the city got its first congressional district, which he had fought for.
The public viewing of Pimentel's remains at the City Tourism Hall started on Thursday, October 24.
A 5 am mass will be offered on Friday, October 25, before Pimentel's remains would be brought back to Manila.
The 85-year-old Pimentel died on October 20, after a bout with lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. – Rappler.com

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines — The Philippine National Police in Region 10 (PNP-10) warned business owners to pay the Social Security System (SSS) contribution of their employees otherwise they will face legal action or even arrest.
“Delinquent employers must religiously pay the contributions and salary loan payments of their workers to SSS or face legal consequences,” Brig. Gen. Rafael Santiago Jr., PNP-10 Regional Director, said Thursday (Oct. 10) following the arrest of businessman Bienvenido Macaraeg Jr.
Macaraeg, owner of bread and pastries maker Sunny Farm Foods in this city, was apprehended inside a shopping mall by a team of operatives from the PNP-10 Regional Intelligence Division and SSS-10.
He didn’t pay the contributions of his 28 workers from 2011 to 2015, according to SSS.
“He owes over P1.2 million in unpaid SSS contribution with corresponding penalty,” Carlos Flaviano, SSS-10 intelligence officer, said in a phone interview.
Macaraeg was charged for violation of Section 22 (a) and (d) in relation to Section 28 of Republic Act 8282 or the Social Security Law.
Lt. Col. Mardy Hortillosa, PNP-10 Spokesperson, said the warrant of arrest was issued in 2017 by Judge Marites Filomena Rana-Bernales of the 10th Judicial Region Branch 39.
Macaraeg, Hortillosa said, has told the police he didn’t receive any notification from the SSS and that he wasn’t aware of his mounting payables to the government insurance agency.
But Flaviano said they have notified Macaraeg of his outstanding obligations.
“We have given him time (to pay),” Flaviano said, adding they sent him demand letters several times before filing a formal complaint at the Prosecutor’s Office.
Macaraeg, he said, even went to their office and asked to pay in installments. But he didn’t return to SSS-10 to make the initial payment.
“He (Macaraeg) was given time to settle his obligations to the SSS, but it appeared he did not act on it,” Hortillosa said.
Now that Macaraeg is arrested, he will have to face the case filed against him in court.
Hortillosa said the PNP-10 will coordinate and assist SSS-10 in implementing the arrest warrants against employers who have been delinquent in paying their workers’ contribution. (davaotoday.com)

La Capitale padrona delle arti marziali. Timothy Bos, 22 anni, ha conquistato l'oro nel Campionato mondiale di kick boxing nel Light Contact, categoria Senior -63 kg, disputati a Sarajevo, in Bosnia. Per il giovane romano si tratta del terzo titolo di fila; se poi ci aggiungiamo che il pool arbitrale del Mondiale gli ha anche assegnato l'ambito trofeo di migliore atleta del tatami di tutta la competizione, il bilancio del Bos è davvero entusiasmante. «Un anno di preparazione fisica e mentale, tante rinunce e sacrifici mi hanno portato ad ottenere una enorme soddisfazione per la conquista del mio terzo titolo mondiale racconta il talento romano -. Raggiungere il podio del Mondiale Wako è stato molto impegnativo, ho incontrato avversari davvero forti ed ho dovuto mettere sul tatami tutta la tecnica, la tattica e la concentrazione possibile». Una tripletta da record per il 22enne, cresciuto nella palestra Sparta Pugilato nel quartiere Aurelio-Boccea, dove si allena nel Team Bos Roma ExtremeFighters, e che lo scorso anno è stato insignito della medaglia al valore atletico dal Coni. Una passione nata a soli sei anni, e che lo ha portato poi a conquistare titoli europei e mondiali nel taekwondo. Contemporaneamente però ha portato avanti anche un'altra passione, quella del kick boxing. E qui il palmares è diventato eccezionale: 7 titoli nazionali, 2 europei e 3 mondiali. Dal 2017 fa parte del Top Ten Elite Team con alcuni dei migliori campioni internazionali. E tanto di tutto questo successo lo deve al padre Wim, maestro internazionale di taekwondo, che lo allena da sempre: «In generale ho un team di professionisti che mi segue costantemente e si prende cura della mia preparazione. Ma è vero che devo tutto alla mia famiglia, che mi è sempre stata vicino nel mio percorso», confessa l'atleta romano. Quattro i suoi principi chiave: passione, sacrificio, allenamento e perseveranza. Una ricetta chiara, che lo ha portato sul tetto del mondo.

Education Sec. Briones to teachers: More benefits come with greater responsibilities 2 SHARES Share it! Share Tweet
By Merlina Hernando-Malipot
As the government continues to improve their welfare through higher salaries and better benefits, Education Secretary Leonor Briones challenged teachers to be the “driving force” that would help uplift the quality of education in the country.
“As we increase the salaries and improve the terms of employment of our public school teachers, we expect our teachers to be the driving force to raise the quality of the country’s basic education,” Briones said during the 2019 World Teachers’ Day (WTD) in Cagayan De Oro City.
Briones told the thousands of teacher-attendees that the “biggest concern” of the DepEd is “education quality” where their role is very crucial. “While investing in education has produced major gains in access to education, the evidence is clear that the quality of our learning outcomes leaves much to be desired,” she added.
Recognizing that “there is so much work to be done,” for the education sector, Briones also reminded the teachers that “the fight for quality will require no less than a national effort, with our teachers at the forefront.”
Added Compensation, Improved Opportunities
Among the highlights of the recent WTD celebration is DepEd’s assurance of a new round of salary increase for state workers which include public school teachers following the Department of Budget and Management’s (DBM) completion of its study on benchmarking the salaries of government personnel.
Between the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) III from 2009 to 2012 and the SSL IV from 2016 to 2019, DepEd emphasized that the monthly basic salary of a Teacher I has increased from P14,198 to P20,754 – noting that there was no SSL was implemented from the years 2013 to 2015.
DepEd noted that apart from the government-mandated compensation and benefit for all employees — which amount to a total of P27,996 per month for entry-level teachers – public school teachers receive allowance accorded only to the department’s teachers: cash allowance (P3,500/year); Proportional Vacation Pay[1] (P36,994.83 to P38,340.10 for SY 2018-2019); hardship allowance (15-25% of monthly basic salary); honoraria for teaching overload (25% of monthly basic salary); additional incentives/allowance from local government units (LGUs).
Additionally, DepEd said that Bicameral Committee version of the 2019 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) also included annual medical examination (P500/year) and 2019 WTD incentive (P1,000) for public school teachers.
Recognizing the need for teachers to have improved professional growth and opportunities, Briones also noted that DepEd is proposing to add new teaching positions of Teacher IV, Teacher V, Teacher VI, and Teacher VII with corresponding higher salary grades after the current items of Teacher I, Teacher II, and Teacher III.
“Napapansin namin at sinabi rin ng mga teacher, minsan nag-uumpisa silang Teacher I forever Teacher I na lang sila, maghihintay pa kung mayroong magre-retire (We notice and the teachers also say, sometimes they start Teacher I and they stay at Teacher I forever, waiting for someone to retire),” Briones said.
Briones said that this is the reason why DepEd made a proposal submitted to the DBM and the President on additional teaching positions with equally higher salaries depending on the performance. “If you do well, then you go up,” she added.
Given these, Briones reminded everyone in the DepEd of their vital role the delivery of quality basic education – as mandated by the Constitution. “Kung mayroong asenso, mayroon ding responsibilidad” (If there’s growth, there is also a responsibility),” she added.
Meanwhile, Briones challenged the teachers anew to “think of new and innovative ways” of teaching. “The battle for quality basic education will be fought and won at our classrooms, by our teachers,” she said. “Ultimately, it is in the classrooms where the day-to-day learning of our students happens,” she ended.

Two Birmingham restaurants have closed amid cashflow problems - leaving their owner heartbroken.
Emma-Louise Yufera said the decision to shut Migas in Sutton Coldfield and El Borracho de Oro in Edgbaston was the hardest personal loss she had ever endured.
"I feel my heart has broken into tiny pieces and I feel so so sad I have not been able to save my businesses which I love so very much," she said.
"I have made and built them from scratch, they have my literal blood, sweat and tears in them and life will never be the same without them
"Thank you everyone- this journey has been incredible."
Emma previously ran Don Diego, which occupied the same Sutton premises, before returning to the town with Migas .
Last year, she condemned diners who booked tables at the tapas venues but then failed to show up, saying they were "killing" her business .
But in a post on El Borracho's Facebook page on Saturday, October 12, Emma said a combination of the political climate and increased costs of produce from Spain meant savings were being drained by VAT bills.
She wrote: "Six months of VAT may not seem like a huge amount, and really it isn’t, there will be companies and even individuals who owe HMRC much much much more than we do.
"However it is enough to suffocate us as any savings, back ups, buffers are used up and business does not look set to pick up by the amount that we need every week.
"I realise that El B and Migas have been popular and important restaurants for many people, we have helped celebrate weddings, birthdays, engagements, retirements, first dates and family gatherings.
"It seems almost unimaginable to me that I won’t be going to El B for a paella in November for Alfie’s birthday, I can’t imagine how Monday’s will look now as I won’t see Sue for a catch up, coffee and event planning.
"I’m going to miss my customers so, so, so, so much."
Emma's full statement
"It is with the heaviest of hearts that I announce the closure today of both Migas and El B.
"It hardly seems real or believable that after this many years running restaurants, after all the many trials and tribulations we have been through, after the personal, sacrifices that it could end up at this point.
"It has always been difficult in this industry, always, as a fresh food business it has been harder still as our personnel costs are higher than prepared food places.
"As an independent we don’t have the purchasing power of big chains and then this year in particular has seen the rope around our necks squeeze tighter.
"A combination of political uncertainty, a very poor summer weather wise, increased costs of products from Spain has all meant we have struggled each month.
"Never quite doing what we need to cover all operating costs. In order to then maintain supplies & staff we have prioritised their payments over VAT.
"This has meant we have struggled to pay our VAT for six months. Six months of VAT may not seem like a huge amount, and really it isn’t, there will be companies and even individuals who owe HMRC much much much more than we do, however it is enough to suffocate us as any savings, back ups, buffers are used up and business does not look set to pick up by the amount that we need every week.

"I’m going to miss my customers so so so so much. Of all the personal losses I have ever had to endure this is the hardest so far, I feel my heart has broken into tiny pieces and I feel so so sad that I have not been able to save my businesses which I love so very much.

Two senior Pemex officials were secretly recorded explaining how to engage in bribery at the state oil company during a 2017 dinner with two former Israeli intelligence agents.
Two ex-agents of Mossad, a man and a woman who were employed by the Israeli investigation company Black Cube, passed themselves off as representatives of a United Arab Emirates (UAE) investor interested in buying the Mexican oilfield services company Oro Negro.
In that context, the private investigators – who were actually hired by Oro Negro – invited former Pemex drilling and services chief José Carlos Pacheco Ledesma and former exploration and production deputy director Luis Sergio Guaso Montoya to dinner at Sir Winton Churchill’s restaurant in Mexico City.
Audio recordings made during the meeting were presented as evidence in a lawsuit filed by Oro Negro against the Mexican government last year and have now been reviewed by media organizations including the newspapers El Universal and The Wall Street Journal.
Oro Negro claims that Pemex drove it into bankruptcy because it refused to pay bribes and is seeking US $700 million in damages, a payout which would be a heavy burden for an oil company that has in excess of US $100 billion in debt.
According to a report published Monday by El Universal, Pacheco revealed a range of details about corruption at Pemex during the presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto, focusing specifically on the period between 2012 and 2016 when Emilio Lozoya – who is currently sought by authorities on corruption charges – was at the helm of the state-run company.
Pacheco told the investigators which Pemex officials had to be paid bribes to in order to win contracts, how large the bribes had to be and how much of that money ended up in Lozoya’s pocket.
He also provided details about how much had to be paid in order to arrange an appointment with the Pemex CEO – up to US $100,000 – and how the bribe money was laundered.
Pacheco explained that Pemex officials often used sham companies operated by their children to collect and launder bribes.
Pemex directors had received up to US $5 million in exchange for a single contract, Pacheco said at one stage in the conversation, adding that the amount that the purported UAE investor would have to be pay would likely be less because the deal would involve taking over contracts already awarded to Oro Negro.
However, he added that bribe money also has to “permeate” the lower ranks of Pemex in order for a deal to go ahead.
Both Pacheco and Guaso also said that former energy secretary Pedro Joaquín Coldwell was aware of corruption at the state oil company and “also received his part” of the bribes. Coldwell rejected the accusation in an interview with the broadcaster Univision.
After the private investigators asked how a bribe would be disguised, Pacheco explained again that payments are usually made to companies with links to the corrupt officials.
“There are deputy directors, for example, that his son is the one responsible” for collecting payments, he said. “A lot of times everyone knows it.”
Asked why Oro Negro had run into problems with Pemex – which canceled its contracts in late 2017 after it filed for bankruptcy protection – Pacheco said it was “an economic issue.”
Asked by a Black Cube agent whether the contracts were lost due to a failure to pay bribes, the Pemex official responded: “they didn’t have money, that is the main problem.”
During the dinner, Pacheco also told his companions that Carlos Morales, a former director of exploration and production at Pemex, collected more than 2 billion pesos (US $103.8 million at today’s exchange rate) from contractors to fund the 2012 presidential campaign of Peña Nieto.
No further details about the scheme were offered, El Universal said, and the Black Cube agents didn’t pursue the matter.
Lozoya, who authorities believe is on the run in Europe, has also been accused of funneling part of a US $10-million bribe that he allegedly received from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht in exchange for the awarding of Pemex contracts.
Lozoya didn’t become Pemex CEO until after Peña Nieto assumed the presidency in December 2012 but part of the Odebrecht bribe was allegedly paid before he took on the role.
Pacheco and Guaso were not the only Pemex officials secretly recorded by Black Cube.
Between September and November 2017, several other former and then-current Pemex officials described what The Wall Street Journal called an “elaborate pay to play system” at the oil company.
The Journal reported that Pacheco acknowledged in a telephone conversation that he met with people he believed were interested in purchasing Oro Negro but he denied that he spoke about bribery.
“I worked for Pemex for more than 25 years, and I never had anything to do with that sort of thing, that sort of corruption,” he said.
Mexican and United States authorities are already investigating overpayments of hundreds of millions of dollars in the state oil company’s purchase of several fertilizer plants and a phosphorite reserve during the presidency of Peña Nieto.
The investigations have implicated high-level officials in the previous administration for bribery, including Lozoya, Coldwell and the former president himself.
United States authorities are investigating Peña Nieto in connection with the 2015 sale of a Michoacán plant owned by the fertilizer company Fertinal, El Universal said.
The former president, Coldwell and Lozoya have all denied the accusations of corruption leveled against them.

When attacking the fall mixed sales, the key to future success lies in the ability to properly measure risk versus reward. That’s why the eight-year-old mare Veracity (Distorted Humor), in foal to Justify, figures to bring a healthy sum at the Fasig-Tipton November Night of the Stars Nov. 5. The risk is minimal and the rewards are all but guaranteed.
Veracity has had two foals that have been put up for auction, both fillies by Medaglia d’Oro. This year, her yearling sold for $900,000 at the Saratoga Sale and was purchased by Claiborne Farm. In 2018, Lael Stable spent $1 million on her first yearling, also purchased at Saratoga.
“Her family is very active now,” said consignor Shack Parrish, the president of Indian Creek. “For her first two foals to sell for what they did speaks volumes. She’s in foal to Justify, her family is very alive and her first two foals sold for what they did. That makes her the whole package.”
Veracity’s third foal is a weanling filly, also by Medaglia d’Oro. Owner Bob Edwards has said he plans on keeping her and racing her.
Edwards’s e5 Stable acquired Veracity at Keeneland’s January Horses of Racing Age sale, buying her for $460,000. That may seem like a lot to pay for a mare who had only broken her maiden during her racing career, but if you dig just a bit deeper you’ll find that she is part of one of the hottest families in racing right now.

Veracity’s dam is Yell (A.P. Indy), a multiple graded stakes winner. She is a full-sister to Cheery, who is the dam of multiple Grade I winner Elate (Medaglia d’Oro). She is also a half-sister to the dam Toll (Giants Causeway), who produced Tax, the winner of this year’s GIII Withers S. and the GII Jim Dandy S.
At the time Edwards purchased Veracity, all Elate had done was to break her maiden. Subsequent victories by Elate in the 2017 GI Beldame S. and GI Alabama S., plus wins in the GII Delaware Handicap in 2018 and 2019, have left little doubt about the family’s potency.
“What Elate has done has certainly helped,” Parrish said. “Elate is probably the best mile-and-a-quarter filly in the country. Tax helps, too. There is so much depth to this horse’s pedigree and I think that’s the reason why Claiborne went in and bought the second foal.”
Fasig-Tipton President and CEO Boyd Browning said he believed that potential buyers would also appreciate the fact that Veracity’s pedigree derives from bloodlines that connect her to Paul Mellon’s Rokeby Stables. Glowing Tribute, who is the dam of GI Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero (Polish Navy), who campaigned for Rokeby and trainer Mack Miller, shows up in her pedigree.
“To a pedigree student, Veracity’s pedigree exemplifies a commitment to breeding,” he said. “You study her pedigree and the roots go all the way back to Rokeby Stables and Mr. Mellon. And it’s hard to imagine a more dedicated breeder in this industry over the last 100 years than Mr. Mellon. Clearly, it produced some very positive results for him. It’s the family of his Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero.”
Parrish underscored the unique opportunity.
“She could be one of the three best mares in foal to Justify and you might not see the others on the market,” Parrish said. “This might be the chance to see something on the market you’re not going to see again. It’s going to be very interesting to see how that goes.”
Meanwhile, Veracity’s two-year-old Medaglia d’Oro filly Correctness is turning in regular five-furlong breezes for trainer Arnaud Delacour and should make her debut any day now. A lot of eyes will be on her when she does.
“She’s ready to run,” Delacour said. “She’s a nice filly. It took her a while to come along, which, considering the pedigree, is not a surprise. She progressed and improved all summer and is ready. I’m looking for a race for her. I want her to go long on the dirt and when I say long I mean anything at seven furlongs or longer. I definitely like her. She is a quality filly.”
Delacour said that Correctness will likely debut at either Aqueduct or Laurel. It will be close when it comes to whether or not she will race before Veracity is sold Nov. 5.
While a win by Correctness will only make Veracity more valuable, it’s hard to imagine anything would put a dent into what is already obvious: this is a mare that will be on many buyers’ short list.

Dan Janssen began his political career in last year’s provincial election. Although he didn't win, the 37-year-old is taking his experience into the federal campaign and trying to lead the NDP to another in Parliament.
“I keep hearing from people that they want change, so I believe that change will come because it has just been so many folks talking about,” he told BarrieToday. “Something at some point has to give.”
Janssen says he's hearing from many people who are interested in the NDP platform once he shares information.
“When I go to door to door and provide our platform, I can say that what's resonating with people is our tax fairness plan,” he said. “We want anyone with $20 million or more in assets to pay their fair share.
“It would not be that big of a burden for them and actually it is Canadians who are the ones shouldering the burden of the tax system at the moment," Janssen added. "If they would just pay that one per cent, it would help out greatly.”
Janssen says residents' ears perk up when he mentions how tax fairness would help with covering a wide array of medical help. The NDP has a universal pharmacare plan that would help with covering dental and access to mental health and addiction services, he says.
“When I talk about those things, I hear stories about folks who don’t have access to those things and some of the stories that go along with that,” Janssen said. “Some of us are very lucky, myself included as I have a benefit plan. It is life-changing to have a plan and have access to the medication you need or to go see a dentist and not put it off because you can’t afford it.”
Affordability is another topic he hears while campaigning. As a parent himself, Janssen wants to see families be able to build a life in a home they can call their own.
“For young families, that child-care plan has been resonating as well as our affordable-housing plan,” he said. “We obviously know about the homeless issue in our area, but others are getting pushed out of their homes, too.
“Seniors I have spoken to are concerned about getting kicked out of their homes because their insurance bills are going up and their phone bills are rising; they are being priced out of their own homes," Janssem added. "This isn’t right and we do have a way to make it stop.”
Janssen's campaign office is located at 112 Dunlop St. E. For more information, click here.
The federal election is Oct. 21.

Little attention is paid to Ecuador. The murder rate is low, and there are no drug cartels like those that have dominated the criminal landscape in Mexico and Colombia. Yet Ecuador is one of the world’s cocaine superhighways. This is how the international drug trade likes it. Low key, low profile.
Over a third of Colombia’s booming cocaine production now flows into Ecuador, according to Ecuadorean anti-narcotics sources. From the country’s ports, coastline and airports, it is then dispatched around the world, destined for the United States, Europe and even Asia and Oceania.
Behind this trade is a complex and fluid underworld of specialist groups and sub-contractors coordinated by the brokers of powerful transnational drug trafficking organizations, and protected by corruption networks that penetrate deep into the state.
*This article is part of an InSight Crime investigation into how Ecuador became one of the global cocaine trade’s primary dispatch points.
Cornerstone in the Supply Chain
Ecuador’s role in the drug trade dates back to the 1980s, when it was a transit route for Peruvian coca base trafficked into Colombia, and home to precursor chemical trafficking networks that supplied the Colombian laboratories that processed that base into cocaine.
However, it wasn’t until the turn of the century that Colombia’s quiet neighbor emerged as a cornerstone of the transnational cocaine supply chain. It began with the dollarization of the economy in response to an economic and political crisis in 2000, which instantly made Ecuador a money launderer’s dream: a country bordering the world’s biggest cocaine producer that uses the currency of the world’s largest cocaine market.
Around the same time, a military assault and mass aerial spraying of coca crops in Colombia was pushing both the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) and coca cultivation towards the Ecuador border. The FARC established control over cocaine production in the region, and began supplying traffickers from the Norte del Valle Cartel, who opened up routes into and out of Ecuador. The Mexicans soon wanted in on the action, and Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo,” ordered his lieutenants to set up their own networks in the country.
SEE ALSO: Ecuador News and Profile
The convergence of these underworld forces on Ecuador coincided with a turning point in both the country’s political and criminal history: the 2006 presidential election that brought Rafael Correa to power.
Correa’s administration would prove a paradox. He oversaw a dramatic fall in violence and record drug seizures while bringing in an era of unprecedented political stability. But his government was plagued by drug trafficking scandals, and his strongman style weakened the capacity of the Ecuadorean state and civil society to resist drug trafficking.
One of Correa’s first moves as president was to end the lease of the US naval base in Manta — an election promise made to the FARC in return for campaign financing, according to recovered guerrilla communications, although Correa denies all knowledge of this. The decision created a huge blind spot in Ecuador’s waters and skies that was soon filled with drug boats and planes.
The closure of Manta was just the start of an antagonistic foreign policy approach that saw his government fall out with both Colombia and the United States. As a result, anti-narcotics cooperation with both the supply and demand countries Ecuador is caught between was pared back to a bare minimum.
Correa’s domestic policies also created space for drug trafficking to flourish. He politicized the judiciary, using it as a tool to take down opponents. He also directed the security forces and intelligence units away from combating organized crime, and instead turning them on his political adversaries, according to police and intelligence sources, and cowed the press and non-governmental watchdogs with his fiery rhetoric and legal action.
Whether by accident, design, or both, Correa’s administration lowered Ecuador’s resilience to drug trafficking at a crucial moment. Over a decade on from his election, and Ecuador is now an organized crime haven and arguably the main dispatch point for Colombian cocaine outside of Colombia itself.
Drug Trafficking Routes
There are two pathways cocaine takes through Ecuador — the Pacific route and the Amazon route.
The Pacific route is largely supplied by cocaine produced in Nariño, the border department that has more coca than anywhere else in Colombia. Drugs either enter Ecuador on small boats navigating the tangled jungle waterways that converge on the Mataje river separating Nariño from the Ecuadorean province of Esmeraldas, or hidden in vehicles crossing the Rumichaca international bridge into the province of Carchi.
Shipments are collected at stash points near the border. Drugs that cross into Esmeraldas are hidden on properties and beaches dotting the Esmeraldas coastline, while loads that move through Carchi are stored on at farms and ranches in the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas. Some loads are then moved by boats that hug the coastline and hide in craggy inlets. Most of the drugs, however, are moved by road, stashed in commercial trucks, private vehicles and even public transport.
The Amazon route is mostly supplied by cocaine from Putumayo, the Colombian department with the second highest levels of coca cultivation after Nariño, and leads through the Ecuadorean province of Sucumbíos.
The main border crossings are the San Miguel and Putumayo rivers, where small boats deposit loads at stash points in lawless underworld outposts, such as Puerto Nuevo, Puerto Mestanza, and Tarapoa. However, drugs also move directly across the San Miguel international bridge after being loaded into vehicles in Colombia. From Sucumbíos, traffickers take the country’s main highways to dispatch points.
Figures obtained from anti-narcotics sources, show that in 2018, 44 percent of drug seizures were destined for the United States, 22 percent for Europe, 4 percent for Central America, and one percent for each Asia and for Oceania, while 28 percent was unknown. The US market is mainly supplied by boats launched from the coast, and light aircraft, while cocaine is sent to Europe on contaminated cargo shipping.
Currently, the bulk of the cocaine shipped from Ecuador for the US market is dispatched from the coasts of Esmeraldas, Manabí, Santa Elena, and to a lesser extent Guayas and El Oro in motorboats, although traffickers also use fishing vessels, submersibles and the stripped-out boats with fibre-glass coverings that anti-narcotics authorities call Low-Profile Vehicles (LPV).
The trafficking often begins with a hijacking. Pirate crews lurk off the coast, preying on fishermen to steal their boats and outboard motors at the point of a gun. The boats are then manned with crews recruited from struggling fishing villages, where $30,000 for a five-day trip is an enticing proposition, despite the risk they will end up joining hundreds of other Ecuadorean fishermen in foreign prisons, or will be among the many others that disappear without a trace.
Traffickers then have a choice of three routes. From Esmeraldas they can make a direct run to Central America, but this brings them perilously close to US and Colombian patrols. Instead, most prefer to loop around either north or south of the Galapagos Islands. The most recent US National Drug Threat Assessment estimated that in 2017, 17 percent of all US-bound cocaine first passed around the Galapagos islands, up from just 4 percent in 2016, and 1 percent in 2015.
The boats traffickers use for the Pacific runs are not equipped for long-distance high seas travel and must refuel as many as six times along the way. The fuel is provided by fishing vessels, which leave the city of Manta laden with gasoline and a satellite phone and wait at pre-arranged locations. The fishing boats carry five tanks at a time, allowing them to refuel several boats. Each tank is sold for $35,000, potentially earning them $175,000 per 1-2-week trip.
The traffickers’ journeys usually end off the Pacific coasts of Mexico or Central America, above all Guatemala or Costa Rica. Here they may be met by boats to hand over loads, but fear of being violently double-crossed has fueled the use of GPS-enabled radio or satellite buoys. This allows them to drop their shipments overboard before passing the coordinates to the pickup crews, which find them by following the signals emitted by the buoys.
While coastal dispatches remain the main method for trafficking US-bound cocaine, the use of Ecuador as an air bridge is on the rise, a result, authorities believe, of increased pressure on maritime routes.
Traffickers mostly use Cessna aircraft that are stripped out and modified so they can carry more drugs and fuel, and are even capable of refueling themselves mid-air. These aircraft can carry between 400 and 700 kilos, and take around six hours to reach Costa Rica or Guatemala, where they either unload or refuel and continue to Mexico.
Planes take off using a variety of clandestine or improvised airstrips. Traffickers construct airstrips by leveling off land in isolated areas, use existing strips on private or commercial properties such as strips used for crop dusting planes on fruit plantations, or they use abandoned airports or even roads closed for construction.
For cocaine shipped to Europe, however, the main routes run through Ecuador’s ports: Puerto Bolivar, and above all, the country’s international trade hub of Guayaquil. Control of the ports is low, while corruption is high, and traffickers have an array of options for hijacking the freight that moves through them.
Some seek total control of the shipment by using front export companies as a façade for their shipments. These shell companies are set up in the names of frontmen, commonly people with few economic resources and no criminal background. In other cases they buy existing companies with long histories of clean exports to reduce the risk of them receiving anything but the most cursory inspection. Ostensibly legal export shipments are then arranged, and the cocaine is concealed within the products.
However, a more common technique is to contaminate legal shipments, hiding drugs in containers either before they enter the port, in the port or after the ships leave the docks.
To get their drugs into shipments before entering the port, traffickers target not the goods but the containers themselves. They pack drugs into compartments in the floor, ceiling or walls of empty containers in storage yards then use contacts in shipping companies to ensure their container is sent to a company planning an export to their target destination.
The containers may also be contaminated after entering the port district. Freight trucks with drugs hidden in secret compartments enter the district and move to known blind spots in security camera coverage to unload. Dock workers then break open containers and load the drugs among the legal produce. A cloned or fake custom seal is then put in place to mask the tampering.
Containers and even the ships themselves may also be contaminated after they have set sail. Smaller boats approach the ships in Guayaquil’s estuaries and pass the drugs on to contacts among the crew, who pack it into a container or a hiding place on board.
The Criminal Actors
The actors that run these drug routes are a combination of Ecuadorean, Colombian, Mexican and European criminal networks.
Colombian cocaine brokers, such as the criminal group La Constru in Putumayo and the mysterious drug trafficker known only as “El Contador” in Tumaco, negotiate deals in Colombia or in Ecuadorean criminal hubs such Lago Agrio near the Putumayo border, and Guayaquil.
The deals struck are for a quantity of cocaine “puesto en” — or delivered to. For Mexican cartels in particular, the handover can be around the Colombian border. However, the Colombian traffickers can also arrange delivery to dispatch points in Ecuador or to handover points in Europe or off the coasts of Mexico and Central America.
These cocaine brokers sub-contract the work of sourcing and transporting cocaine to the criminal service providers that operate at each link in the chain.
In the frontier region, the key players are the networks left behind from the demobilization of the FARC, which are active on both sides of the border. Rearmed and criminalized guerrilla cells take charge of compiling loads in Colombia and ensure their safe transport into Ecuador. Trafficking is coordinated using the logistics and transport specialists and networks of corrupt officials that used to work trafficking FARC produced cocaine.
The transport networks handover to specialist Ecuadorean dispatch networks. These sophisticated, low-profile organizations are led by individual traffickers, many of whom live disguised among regional social, economic and political elites.
These traffickers organize the logistics of a shipment: coordinating corruption networks, recruiting smugglers, securing fuel, equipment and any other supplies needed. They also hire armed actors to provide security, collect debts and carry out assassinations.
The different trafficking methods all demand different logistical capacities and contacts, and although some traffickers have been known to work with different methods, most are specialized.
Coastal shipments are organized by crime clans, many of which are concentrated in the city of Manta. These networks recruit fishermen from coastal communities to man their boats, organize refueling stops, and equip the boats with communications equipment and supplies.
In addition to securing access to airstrips, networks sending shipments by small aircraft provide fuel through corrupt private sector or state contacts, communications equipment that allows them to coordinate with the incoming pilots, and cloned license plates of planes with permission to fly in the area where they will be landing.
For port dispatches, the key is corrupt contacts. To contaminate containers before loading, they need contacts in the shipping companies, above all with the container dispatchers that control which containers get sent to which companies, and in the storage yards so they can work to load up the drugs. If they contaminate containers within the port district, they need truck drivers, stevedores, security guards and the winch operators that have access to information on the movements and locations of containers.
A Sea of Corruption
These traffickers and the routes they control are protected by corruption networks of astonishing reach.
Police and military not only wave drug shipments through their controls, they have even provided security for drug shipments and their traffickers, transported cocaine in their official vehicles and are even believed to have carried out assassinations, according to intelligence sources.
If traffickers are caught, then most are able to buy their way out of trouble. Sources describe how they pay off prosecutors and judges to sabotage investigations and to obtain favorable rulings. Traffickers are also able to call upon politicians on their payroll, who pull the necessary stings to put an end to their problems.
Although such corruption has been present in Ecuador as long as drug trafficking, official and expert sources all concur that under Rafael Correa it reached epidemic proportions, taking root in all branches of the state.
The 2017 election of President Lenin Moreno promised a new approach. Moreno reached out to the international partners estranged by Correa. Renewed US support has already vastly increased Ecuador’s capacity to track drug boats, while close cooperation with Colombia enabled the two countries to hunt down the border region’s most wanted criminal and dismantle a large part of his network.
Moreno also oversaw the arrest of senior political figures on corruption charges, and promised to investigate the ties between Rafael Correa and underworld groups, although Correa supporters and other critics denounce this as a political purge masquerading as an anti-corruption drive.
However, when a wave of public protests snowballed into violent riots in October 2019, the political terrain again shifted. Moreno blamed Correa loyalists and groups with links to organized crime and drug trafficking for hijacking what had begun as an indigenous protest against fuel subsidies. While those claims remain unverified, one thing is clear: the polarization and political crisis the protests unleashed now threaten to swallow his administration, pushing drug trafficking off the agenda and back to where it thrives — in the shadows.

“The master association got an appraisal that says the houses will devalue between $30,000 to $75,000 per house," said Hayduke. “The devaluation of the whole area is the scary part of it. The estimates is the taxes, the property values could go down by two-, three-hundred million dollars.”

October 28, 2019 : Scenes from preparations for the Breeders’ Cup at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California on October 28, 2019. Sydney Serio/Eclipse Sportswire/Breeders’ Cup/CSM
Code of Honor – Hall of Fame trainer Shug McGaughey's said Tuesday morning, William S. Farish's homebred colt Code of Honor shipped well across country Monday and has settled into his new surroundings at Santa Anita Park.
“He seemed to travel fine,” McGaughey said. “It's a long day for him, but he seemed to come out of it fine. He ate last night and was good this morning. We took him up there and galloped him a mile today and let him walk on through the paddock. It all seems to be good.”
Exercise rider Lexi Pradun was up for Code of Honor's first trip to the track at Santa Anita Park.
McGaughey is enthusiastic about how his chestnut 3yo is coming into the race.
“I feel really good. I think we've got a very, very good horse and he matches up with any of them in the race,” he said. “I love having Johnny Velazquez on him. All I'm going to do is try to keep him as fresh as I possibly can until Saturday. He's coming off two mile-and-a-quarter races. Johnny worked him last Monday (at Belmont Park) and he worked very good (5f in 1:00 1/5), so I think we've got him in a very good spot that way. All I'm doing is waiting to go over there.”
Code of Honor is by Noble Mission, a full brother to the unbeaten European star Frankel. He was second in the Kentucky Derby, won the one-mile Dwyer July 6 and picked up victories in the Travers at Saratoga and the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park. He finished second to Vino Rosso in the Gold Cup, but was moved into the top spot when Vino Rosso was disqualified and dropped to second for bumping in the stretch.
The Gold Cup was Code of Honor's first start against older horses. In the Classic he faces a group of seasoned runners led by 3-1 morning-line favorite McKinzie trained by Bob Baffert. Code of Honor is the co-second choice at 4-1 and will start from the outside in the field of 11.
“I've seen McKinzie run some great races. If he runs his Whitney back or something, he'll be tough. It's a mile and a quarter. We've had to ship out here to Baffert's back yard. That's OK, too. When he takes him over there he's going to be ready. We better be ready, too.”
Elate/Yoshida (Bill Mott) – Making a favorable impression in the morning never has been an issue for multiple Grade I winner Elate, a trend that has continued during her time at Santa Anita Park as she prepares for her slated run against males in the Classic.
The daughter of Medaglia d'Oro returned to the track Tuesday after breezing three furlongs in 36 3/5 Sunday, turning in an easy gallop under exercise rider Juan Quintero. Always one to catch the eye with her willingness to go about her work, Elate is aiming to draw the ultimate attention to herself Saturday if she can join Hall of Famer Zenyatta (2009) as the only female runners to prevail in the $6 million Classic.
“I couldn't have been more happy with her the way we came into the Personal Ensign (finishing second by a nose to Midnight Bisou),” trainer Bill Mott said. “I thought she was doing great and we got beat in a spectacular race. And I thought she went into the Spinster (second to Blue Prize) in good shape so you never know. But she is good right now. I'd say to me, she looks as good as she did going into those two races. We just hopes she holds that form.”
Elate's aptitude over the 10-furlong distance is what helped sway her connections to try a Classic run rather than knocking heads with her nemesis Midnight Bisou in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. She is 3-for-3 at 1 1/4 miles having won the 2017 Alabama Stakes and the past two editions of the Delaware Handicap.
“You know she's a Grade 1 winner at both distances (a mile and an eighth and a mile and a quarter) and it just seems like for whatever reason she just cruises along very well and she still has run in her going a mile and a quarter,” Mott said. “Some horses seem to flatten out a little bit at that distance, but she always seems to be coming on strong.”
One of Elate's top challengers Saturday is a friendly foe of sorts in stablemate and fellow multiple Grade I winner, Yoshida. The son of Heart's Cry hasn't been able to find the winner's circle since taking the 2018 Woodward Stakes but was beaten only 1 ¾ lengths for the victory when running fourth in last year's edition of the Classic.
“He's very good. He's a good competitor and he's done well at a mile and a quarter,” Mott said of Yoshida. “In the Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs, he got beat a length and a half and finished fourth but ran a very good race to a very good group. Thunder Snow and Accelerate were in front of us and I think Thunder Snow beat us a nose. If he repeats that race, that will put him in the mix.”
Yoshida galloped Tuesday under Quintero, having worked a half-mile in 50 flat Sunday.
Higher Power – A year ago, the conversation around John Sadler's barn heading into the Breeders' Cup World Championships centered around whether the longtime trainer would finally get off the duck where the two-day was concerned.
In the latest example of what a difference 365 days can make, the biggest query the longtime horseman is now having to field is whether he can carve out his own place in history with a Classic repeat.
One year after throwing a 600-pound gorilla off his back by conditioning Hronis Racing's Accelerate to victory in the $6 million Classic, Sadler and his biggest clients are aiming to keep the Breeders' Cup hardware in house by sending out Higher Power in this year's 1 1/4m test.
When Accelerate gave Sadler his first Breeders' Cup win with his 45th starter by taking the 2018 Classic, it was a fittingly culmination to a season in which the chestnut runner dominated the handicap ranks with six wins from seven starts. Higher Power's path to the 36th edition of the race has been a more complicated one, but one that could nonetheless give Sadler the distinction of joining Jay Robbins (Tiznow – 2000 and 2001) and Bob Baffert (Bayern – 2014, American Pharoah – 2015, and Arrogate – 2016) as the only trainers to saddle Breeders' Cup Classic winners in consecutive years.
“Like, 10,000 percent better,” Sadler laughed when asked how satisfying it was this season not to have to answer the question of whether he is the best trainer without a Breeders' Cup win. “I'm in a good frame of mind and we have fun horses that we're going to be running over the week. You know some of those races, there are some pretty heavy favorites in there so you don't always know how well you're going to do. But we bring good horses.”
Higher Power galloped 1 1/2 miles Tuesday morning under exercise rider David Pineda and is slated to gate school Wednesday.
Purchased for $250,000 out of the Horses of Racing Age portion of the Keeneland April 2-year-olds in training sale, Higher Power joined the Hronis/Sadler team this spring having only made one prior start against graded company. In his fourth outing for his new connections, however, the 4yo son of Medaglia d'Oro captured the Pacific Classic by 5 ¼ lengths on Aug. 17, defeating a field that included eventual Awesome Again Stakes winner Mongolian Groom.
Though he comes into the Breeders' Cup off a third-place run in the Awesome Again, he also brings with him a valid excuse as he stumbled badly at the start and nearly unseated rider Flavien Prat.
“He still got around there third with a big excuse so hopefully we'll get a good do-over here,” Sadler said. “He's a Medaglia d'Oro, he can run a mile and a quarter, he's got a really good family and they kind of improve over time as they get older. And the people who had him before me did a nice job with him. I got him in good shape and we've just been able to move him up a little bit.”
Math Wizard – Pennsylvania Derby winner Math Wizard was en route from South Florida to Southern California Tuesday morning. Trainer Saffie Joseph Jr. arrived at Santa Anita several hours before the 3yo son of Algorithms, who is scheduled to start in Saturday's Classic.
“He landed in Memphis an hour ago and will be there for an hour and a half,” Joseph said mid-morning. “He's going to land in L.A. at 5:45 today.”
Math Wizard is owned by John Fanelli, Khalid Mischref, Cash Is King LLC, LC Racing LLC, Collarmele Vitelli Racing Stables LLC, Ioannis Zoumas and Bassett Stables.
McKinzie – Tuesday was a quiet, easy day for Classic favorite McKinzie, whose exercise consisted of walking outside trainer Bob Baffert's barn.
McKinzie had his final timed work for the $6 million race Monday – a bullet 5f in 1:00.20 – and Tuesday was his day to relax and recover. Later Monday, McKinzie drew post eight in the field of 11 and was named the 3-1 morning-line favorite.
In the Classic, McKinzie will face the 3yo star Code of Honor, Preakness winner War of Will and Bill Mott's 5yo mare Elate for the first time. Though Baffert did not handicap the field, he said McKinzie has to perform at a high level to be successful.
“He's a good horse and it's a tough race,” Baffert said. “He needs to get away from the gate and get into the race early. That's the way he wants to run and he gets stronger as he goes. But he's got to show up that day. It's all about showing up. I've seen great fields put together but a lot of horses don't show up. It's who shows up is going to get the big prize.”
McKinzie is 0-for-2 at the 11/4m distance of the Classic. He ended up a well-beaten 12th in last year's Classic and was nipped a nose by Gift Box on April 6 in the Santa Anita Handicap.
“He got beat by a really nice horse,” Baffert said. “This horse is a little tricky horse to ride. I know how he has to be ridden so we'll see that happens.”
After McKinzie finished second in the 1 1/8 m Awesome Again Sept. 28 at Santa Anita, Baffert decided to change jockeys. He has replaced Hall of Famer Mike Smith, who was aboard for the 4yo colt's 13 races, with Joel Rosario. A year ago, Rosario rode Accelerate to a win in the Classic.
“There's a lot about this horse; I'm going to sit down with Joel,” Baffert said. “He's ridden against. He's beaten him. He knows him. These guys are so good. They see the videos. They know the horses.”
Mongolian Groom – Trainer Enebish Ganbat spent several minutes quietly watching his 4-year-old gelding Mongolian Groom being bathed Tuesday morning after he jogged 2 miles under exercise rider Jesse Cardenas.
Ganbat said he is pleased with how Mongolian Groom, longshot winner of the Awesome Again, a Breeders' Cup Challenge “Win and You're In” race, looks to him approaching the Classic.
Mongolian Groom drew post nine in the field of 11 for the Classic Monday and Ganbat said that he is fine with that spot for the son of Hightail.
“I'm OK with the post position. Nine is good,” he said. “I like being outside.”
Jockey Abel Cedillo, who guided Mongolian Groom to this gate-to-wire victory at 25-1 in the Awesome Again, will be aboard for the Classic.
Owendale – Rupp Racing's Owendale boarded an early morning flight along with a large contingent of Kentucky-based horses and arrived at Santa Anita just after noon. Trainer Brad Cox was also en route to California and will be on hand for Owendale and his four stablemates' first appearance at Santa Anita Wednesday.
Seeking the Soul – Charles Fipke's Stephen Foster Handicap winner came on the track at 6:45 a.m. Tuesday and had an easy gallop under the watchful eye of trainer Dallas Stewart, who arrived from Kentucky Monday.
“He trained beautifully,” Stewart said. “He's training really well since we left him here. He's comfortable. He's got three works over the track and is really doing well. We're trying to win (the Breeders' Cup Classic), that's our goal, so we wanted to get a race over the track (in the Awesome Again). We were coming off a bad race at Del Mar (in the Pacific Classic), where he got the Thumps and it just didn't work out. He's healthy and he's back at 100 percent. I'm happy. I'm happy anytime I'm in a big race.”
Vino Rosso – Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable's Vino Rosso galloped 1 1/4 miles Tuesday on the morning after arriving at Santa Anita from Belmont Park for a scheduled start in Saturday's Classic.
“He shipped in great. He settled in overnight. I thought he had a good gallop this morning, so things are going to plan so far. Knock on wood,” trainer Todd Pletcher said.
Vino Rosso drew post 10 for the Classic, which met with Pletcher's approval.
“You get a good run to the first turn and we'll try to establish position. You can have your plan, but some of that is dictated by what some of the other horses do. I think we can get a trip where we're in a good stalking position,” Pletcher said. “We know he likes the mile and a quarter. We'll hope to put him in a position to where he can show his strength.”
Vino Rosso captured the 1 1/4m Gold Cup at Santa Anita May 27 and also finished first in the 1 1/4m Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont in his most recent start, only to be disqualified and placed second behind Code of Honor.
“We always felt like he'd improve as a 4-year-old. That's part of the reason why we decided to stop after the Travers last year and give him some time. As you know, things don't always go according to plan, but this is what we had in mind when we made that decision,” Pletcher said. “We're happy everything's fallen into place so far and hope it continues.”
Irad Ortiz Jr. has the return mount about the 4yo son of Curlin.
War of Will – At the risk of stating the obvious, it has served Mark Casse well to heed his clients when they have a particularly strong opinion about one of their charges.
When owner Gary Barber urged the Canadian Hall of Fame trainer to run his filly Got Stormy against males in the Aug. 10 Fourstardave Handicap on one week's rest, Casse was happy to give credit where credit was due as they celebrated a course record-setting triumph by the 4yo chestnut. In the lead up to the $6 million Classic, Barber again went slightly outside the Team Casse norm when he suggested shipping his Preakness Stakes winner War of Will to California early to get an extended feel for the Santa Anita Park track.
Were it left up to him, Casse likely would have not put the son of War Front on the plane until about four or five days out from his expected run. After seeing first-hand on Tuesday how at home his first career classic winner looks while galloping beneath the San Gabriel Mountains, Casse is hoping Saturday goes down as another instance where Barber can say 'Told you so.'
In his first morning getting to lay eyes on the colt in person at Santa Anita, Casse was reaffirmed in his belief that the West Coast is doing wonders for War of Will's mental and physical state. Four days after putting in his second workout over the Arcadia oval, the bay sophomore again made his time over the deep surface look easy during a routine gallop and trip through the paddock Tuesday under Shane Tripp.
“If you look in the past, we've had great success just shipping out four of five days before. We did that with (2016 Juvenile winner) Classic Empire, we've done it with (2017 Mile winner) World Approval, we did it with all our Breeders' Cup winners pretty well,” Casse said. “But Gary was concerned. He said that the Santa Anita track is much deeper now and said 'I really would like to get a couple works over the track, I think it would be beneficial'. So I said to Gary, 'I'm not sure that's the best idea but if that's what you want to do, you're the boss and we'll do it.'
“I think too many times as a trainer, we don't pay attention enough to what the owners want. Ultimately it is their horse. That's the reason I think I've had some great relationships with owners for a long time. It's not a one-man show and I don't think I know it all. But if I said it was a terrible idea and I didn't want to do it, Gary is not one of those guys who would push me into it.”
Getting accustomed to a surface has been key for War of Will this season. When he finished ninth in the Belmont Stakes on June 8, Casse felt the deep going at Belmont was more a contributing factor behind that run than the toll of dancing every dance in the Triple Crown.
“You can tell after a race how he cools out how he handles a race and how he handles the track,” Casse said. “For instance, after the Preakness, 15 minutes after the Preakness he was fine. It took him hours to get over the Belmont. He was just stressed. His second breeze here (at Santa Anita) when he went, not a deep breath. He came back and he recovered quickly.”
After turning in a half-mile breeze in 47 2/5 on Oct. 25, the word was that War of Will was getting better with every trip over the surface.
“Shane, who has gotten on him the entire time at Saratoga and all summer long, said he feels he's never gotten over the track any better,” Casse said. “He looks good. He may look health wise the best I've ever seen him. Our feeling is…if he comes with his big race, everyone is going to know he's there.”

A teacher of the Manila Science High School joins a sit-down protest at their campus in November 2018. Coinciding with protests in more than 350 public schools in Metro Manila, the group pushed for an immediate salary increase and "humane" working conditions for teachers in public schools. George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News/file photo
MANILA - He is not turning back on his promise to increase the salary of public school teachers, but President Rodrigo Duterte said it would take some time before they enjoy a raise.
"We're working on it, akong saad, pero timan-i baya there are millions of teachers," he said in a speech in Cagayan de Oro, where he administered the oath of office of the city's newly elected officials.
(We're working on it, on my promise, but remember there are millions of teachers.)
Public school teachers have been clamoring for a significant increase in their salary following pay hikes for police officers, soldiers, and other uniformed personnel in 2018.
"Gamay raman ning pulis. Ang pulis something like 160,000, ang military 130,000. Dali ra. Mao nang doblado nani sila karon," he said.
(There's only few of them. The police is about 160,000 while the military is about 130,000. It's easy. That's why their salaries have doubled.)
The President said he prioritized those in the uniformed services because they are willing to risk their lives for the country.
"Moingon gani ko sa ila nga, 'Adto ngadto sa Malabang sa Lanao del Sur kay naggiyera didto. Ambak mo sa impyerno, magpakamatay mo.' Mao gyud na ilang buhaton," he said.
(If I will order them, 'Go to Malabang, Lanao del Sur because there is a war. Jump into hell and die.' They will do it.)
An entry-level uniformed officer - Police/Fire/Jail Officer 1, a Private, an Apprentice Seaman, or a Seaman Third Class - is now receiving P29,668 from a base pay of P14,834.
Meanwhile, an entry-level public-school teacher, which has a Salary Grade 11 under Tranche 4 of the Salary Standardization Law, earns a monthly salary of P20,754.
Education Secretary Leonor Briones had said that the government would have to shell out some P150 billion if it would give public school teachers a salary increase of P10,000 per month.

Bale optó por no frenar pese al pedido de un niño que quería una foto con él Crédito: Captura de TV

Es un momento crítico en la carrera profesional de Gareth Bale. A los 30 años, se encuentra envuelto en diferentes cuestionamientos por sus reiteradas lesiones, su falta de liderazgo y el irregular rendimiento que ha mostrado en el último tiempo en Real Madrid. Sin poder jugar desde el 13 de octubre, tras sufrir un edema en el sóleo de su pierna izquierda durante la fecha FIFA con Gales, el delantero realizó un viaje a Londres por "motivos personales" y en su regreso protagonizó un acto que derivó en muchas críticas en las redes sociales.
Al aterrizar ayer en el Aeropuerto de Barajas en Madrid, un niño lo estaba esperando para intentar sacarse una foto con él. "Por favor, mi hijo te quiere mucho", le dijo la madre a Bale, mientras el pequeño lo corría a su lado. Pero el atacante de Real Madrid hizo caso omiso al pedido, nunca se quitó los auriculares y tan solo atinó a mirar hacia un costado levemente, lo que generó hasta la intervención de los periodistas que se encontraban allí.
En su llegada al aeropuerto, Gareth Bale no se quiso sacar fotos con los niños. Fuente: Twitter 00:14

"Fírmale, Bale", le dijo uno de los reporteros de la televisión española, mientras que otro le consultó: "Bale, tienes a niños aquí, ¿quieres firmarles?". Nada funcionó, ya que el jugador siguió camino con el celular en su mano sin hacer declaraciones ni frenar tan solo unos segundos para cumplirle el deseo al niño.
Así, al darse a conocer el video de lo sucedido, su actitud derivó en un fuerte repudio de los fanáticos. "Negarle una firma a un niño le retrata, hay que ser gilipollas, cinco segundos hubieran sido", comentó un usuario en Twitter. "Esto es para que el Real Madrid, que le paga una millonada, le de un toque o directamente lo mande a su casa", agregó otro, que luego derivó en un comentario determinante: "Que le vaya muy bien a donde vaya, en serio. Pero no debería jugar 1 minuto más en el Madrid. Pasa de todo. Nos ha decepcionado a todos".
Bale, un jugador que vive en una burbuja
Ausente en los últimos dos partidos de Real Madrid, hoy tampoco estará en el encuentro frente a Leganés por la undécima fecha de La Liga luego de ausentarse de la práctica del lunes por su viaje a Inglaterra del que regresó ayer. De acuerdo a datos que compartió el Diario Sport, el galés solo jugó el 53% de los minutos posibles desde su llegada en 2013 a Real Madrid, club que pagó alrededor de 100 millones de euros por su ficha.
En el inicio de su séptima temporada en Madrid, Bale concedió hace pocos días una extensa entrevista con el medio británico The Telegraph y relevó que "vive en una burbuja" sin conocer mucho de lo que sucede a su alrededor. Así, por ejemplo, reconoció desconocer de qué se trata el Brexit del Reino Unido. "Las noticias sobre el Brexit las miro con su relación en términos financieros. Me afecta de alguna manera por mis inversiones pero no lo leo la mayoría de las tonterías que se escriben. Realmente no sé el 99% de lo que pasa con el Brexit", comentó el galés.
"Ya siquiera sé quién es el primer ministro del Reino Unido. No tengo ni idea. ¿Boris Johnson? Ahí lo tienes, no lo sabía. ¿Ese no era el alcalde?", agregó el futbolista. "No puedo hablar de algo en lo que no estoy interesado. Yo sigo el golf, ¿quieres que te diga quién es el número uno del mundo? Cuando todo esto termine, me veo jugando en un campo de golf, por supuesto. Estoy en un momento de mi carrera que, con 30 años, he de comenzar a prestarle atención a cosas que no sean fútbol para estar listo cuando me retire".

Mientras esperamos que otros sistemas de pagos móviles como LG Pay o Huawei Pay aterricen en nuestras fronteras, en España los usuarios podemos acceder a Google Pay, Samsung Pay y Apple Pay. La primera es la "solución universal" para Android, la segunda es exclusiva para dispositivos Samsung y la tercera es para dispositivos iOS. Son los sistemas más expandidos en nuestro país, pero no todos son compatibles con todos los bancos.
Así, puedes encontrarte con que al intentar meter tu tarjeta en Google Pay o Apple Pay, la aplicación te diga que no es compatible y tengas que recurrir a otras alternativas, generalmente proporcionadas por el propio banco. Por ello, en este artículo hemos recopilado todos y cada uno de los bancos que están soportados oficialmente por Google Pay, Samsung Payy Apple Pay, de forma que podrás saber de antemano si tu banco/tarjeta es o no compatible con tu terminal.
Google Pay
Empezamos por Google Pay, que es el servicio de pagos móviles de Google. La aplicación viene preinstalada en todos los dispositivos Android compatibles y se puede usar con una buena cantidad de bancos, aunque no con todos.

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines – Hundreds joined the funeral rites of Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Cadet 4th Class Darwin Dormitorio on Wednesday, September 25, united in their belief that the 20-year-old did not die in vain.
Friends and city residents gathered with the Dormitorio family at the Cagayan de Oro Gardens in Barangay Lumbia to pay their last respects to the young man who dreamed of becoming a "changemaker" in the military – a dream that many believed he managed to achieve in his few months as a PMA cadet.
At the funeral rites, friends and family members took turns honoring the memory of Dormitorio, who died from hazing injuries in Fort del Pilar in Baguio City on September 18.
Jean Año, the wife of Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, said that Dormitorio was able to shine a light on continuing cases of maltreatment at the country's premier military academy.
"My husband told me that there will be no whitewash (in the investigation) and I believe in that. We care for the institution and there will be no more maltreatment. Darwin died a hero," she said.
The Año and Dormitorio families have close ties. Dormitorio is the son of retired Army Colonel William Dormitorio, a PMA graduate.
Dormitorio's girlfriend, Ashley Ravidas, said in her eulogy that Darwin was a patriot and wanted to help change the world through public service.
"He talks about serving the country. Every time we had talks about social issues, I would tell him: 'Bhe, I don't like it anymore here in the Philippines. We will go abroad, it is so rotten here.' And he would always tell me not to worry as once he became a soldier, he will use all his powers to change the Philippines. 'So just wait and don't give up,'" Ravidas recalled.
"That is why I'm very proud of him. When he entered the PMA, he brought that attitude with him: Never give up. He died not kneeling down, not begging, but he died standing up and fighting," she added.
Joshua Napone, one of Darwin's closest friends, said that Darwin had always wanted to be a soldier.
"We, his friends, were always supportive of his goals. And we all know in our hearts that he will become a soldier – a super soldier, our Captain Philippines...our brother not by blood but by bonds, the bond that we shared in our squad is something we all deeply cherish. This bond will never be broken even by distance, time nor death," Napone said.
"We promised to do our best for Darwin and to offer everything that we will accomplish to Darwin. Nothing will ever be the same without you and you will get the justice that you deserve," he added.
Dormitorio was accorded full military honors, including a 21-gun salute.
'Just very sorry'
PMA Deputy Dean of Academics Colonel Claro Unson, who was at the funeral, apologized to the Dormitorio family for the PMA's shortcomings in protecting the cadet.
“We are just very sorry. We’ve had our shortcomings,” said Unson.
“The death of Cadet Dormitorio will serve as the rallying point for change and that is actually on maltreatment or hazing, as it is known,” he added.
Unson denied that the academy cultivated a "culture of retaliation" among PMA upperclassmen directed against plebes." He said such incidents were never allowed and were done in secret.
He assured the Dormitorio family and their relatives and friends that changes were underway at the PMA.
Dormitorio's death has prompted the resignation of PMA Superintendent Lieutenant General Ronnie Evangelista and Commandant of Cadets Brigadier General Bartolome Vicente Bacarro, both citing command responsibility in taking the action.
Several cadets had been expelled, suspended, and received other forms of punishment for their involvement in the incident. Several officers at the PMA Station Hospital, where Dormitorio received medical treatment and later died, had been relieved of their posts. – Rappler.com

VIRGINIA CITY, Nev., Oct. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comstock Mining Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE American: LODE) today announced selected unaudited financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019.

Third Quarter 2019 Selected Strategic Highlights
Selected Financial Highlights for the three-months ended September 30, 2019
Selected Financial Highlights for the nine-months ended September 30, 2019
Mr. Corrado De Gasperis, Executive Chairman and CEO stated, “Our focus on realigning and transforming the Company and its balance sheet is finally coming to fruition. We have now received over $4.25 million in non-refundable cash deposits and $5 million in stated stock for the Lucerne sale, signed new agreements to sell our Silver Springs properties for over $10 million and launched a globally-focused mercury remediation business with world-class technology and experience all while continuing to lower our net operating costs.”
Corporate Realignment
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a transformational strategy focused on high-value, cash-generating, precious metal-based activities, (the “Strategic Focus”) including, but not limited to, metals exploration, engineering, resource development, economic feasibility assessments, mineral production, metal processing and related ventures of environmentally-friendly, and economically enhancing mining technologies.
The Company advanced the Strategic Focus by facilitating the formation of a qualified opportunity zone fund named Sierra Springs Opportunity Fund Inc. and Sierra Springs Enterprises Inc., its qualified opportunity zone business. Sierra Springs Enterprises, Inc. has formally agreed to acquire Comstock’s non-mining assets and has also secured over a dozen independent projects, including the development of the Silver Springs Airport, a centrally located regional airport, the acquisition of certain exceptionally well located and adjacent lands and water rights, and the rights to a number of conservation-based, non-mining businesses. These businesses include a Tahoe-based, high pH spring water, an agricultural-ready manufacturing and processing facility and a business to manufacture and sell a totally compostable green bottle and caps, designed to displace single-use petroleum-based plastics.
Mr. Corrado De Gasperis, Executive Chairman and CEO stated, “Our focus on realigning and transforming the Company is accelerating, especially with the addition of JC to our team. Our goal is to grow per-share value by commercializing environment-enhancing, precious-metal-based products and processes that generate predictable cash flow (throughput) and increase the long-term enterprise value of our platform.”
Comstock Processing LLC and Mercury Clean Up LLC
During 2019, Comstock and Comstock Processing LLC, the wholly-owned subsidiary that owns all of the property, plant, equipment and permits for the Crushing, Agglomerating, Leaching, Merrill Crowe Processing, Mercury Retort, Refining and Metallurgical operations located at 1200 American Flat, Virginia City, NV, entered into a definitive agreement with Mercury Clean Up LLC (“MCU”), in collaboration with Oro Industries Inc. (“Oro”), for the manufacture and global deployment of mercury remediation systems with proprietary mechanical, hydro, electro-chemical and oxidation processes to reclaim, treat and remediate mercury from soils, waste and tailings.
MCU has the exclusive, world-wide rights to four patentable technologies and equipment that we believe will demonstrate feasible, economic mercury remediation. Comstock provides the platform for testing the mercury remediation system, and MCU will conduct the trials that prove scalable feasibility. MCU plans to deploy the solution globally and is working on at least one major, international remediation project. Comstock’s award-winning mercury reclamation experience coupled with MCU’s technology and processing know-how positions a new, global growth opportunity consistent with the Company’s Strategic Focus and cash-generating growth plans.
Comstock Exploration & Development (100% owner of Dayton Resource and Spring Valley Exploration Areas)
For the Dayton resource, Comstock previously discovered a newly recognized, mineralized, cross-cutting shear zone. An assay sample of the material identified three feet of 0.246 ounces per ton (OPT) gold and 3.553 OPT silver. Sampling was expanded and exposed another 90.8 feet of mineralized shear zone, beginning deep inside the Dayton adit. This overall sampling program identified precious metals averaging 0.043 OPT gold and 0.404 OPT silver for the entire zone, including 7.5 feet averaging 0.121 OPT gold and 0.753 OPT silver. The Company is proceeding to publish a separate NI 43-101 compliant, updated technical report for the Dayton resource that supports the subsequent scope of publishing a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) for the Dayton project.
Story continues
The Company is also continuing its exploration activities southerly into Spring Valley with plans for incremental exploration programs that include exploration and definition drilling of targets identified by geophysical surveys, surface mapping, prior drilling and deeper geological interpretations that together are expected to lead to publishing an updated, NI 43-101 compliant, mineral resource estimate for the Dayton Project and the expanded opportunities.

Comstock Northern Exploration LLC (Occidental Lode and Other Northern Target Mineral Claims)

Tonogold has commenced further analysis of our northern targets that we believe is extraordinary, correlating historical data with modern geological assessments and creating a larger exploration opportunity. Accordingly, the Company signed a new mineral lease with Tonogold that commits Tonogold to a minimum of $5 million towards the exploration of Comstock’s northern mineral claims and an additional minimum of $5 million for exploration and economic feasibility development, while eliminating the Company’s related maintenance costs and retaining the Company’s rights to a 1.5-3.0% NSR royalty. The Company believes this will accelerate the development of its northern targets and enhance the value of its mineral property portfolio and royalty package.
Comstock Mining LLC (100% owner of the Lucerne Resource Area)
Comstock’s collaborative efforts with Tonogold have evolved extensively during 2019, resulting in an enhanced sales agreement that immediately values Lucerne at more than $24 million ($11.5 million in cash, $5.5 million in stock and over $7 million in assumed liabilities) plus a 1.5% NSR royalty on Lucerne’s future production while already delivering over $2 million in annualized savings. The Company has received non-refundable cash deposits of $4.25 million through October 28, 2019. The Company’s recent agreement requires additional cash payments at closing of $3.325 million, bringing total cash payments to over $7.5 million, providing Tonogold a majority membership interest of 50.3% in Comstock Mining LLC. The remaining $3.95 million in cash owed represents a secured obligation of Tonogold with scheduled monthly payments of at least $650 thousand each due starting in January 2020, through June 2020. Once fully paid, Tonogold will own 100% of Comstock Mining LLC.

Comstock also terminated the previous option agreement, resulting in prior option payments of $2.2 million being recorded as income for the third quarter ending September 30, 2019.
Sierra Springs Opportunity Zone Fund Inc. and Sierra Springs Enterprises Inc.
Last year, the U.S. Treasury confirmed that all of Storey County, NV, and significant parts of Silver Springs, NV, had been certified as Qualified Opportunity Zones. We are actively engaged in plans to enhance our mining and non-mining assets and core competencies in these locations, including an expanded land, water and technology portfolio, to maximize the value of our platform, first and foremost by selling our non-mining assets.

Sierra Springs Opportunity Fund Inc. was formed to capitalize on the extraordinary, explosive growth of high-tech industries in northern Nevada and its qualified zones and has already secured the rights to thousands of developable acres of land and more, including an agreement to purchase Comstock’s Silver Springs properties and water rights, all within the immediate proximity of the Tahoe Reno Industrial (TRI) Center and its over 100 businesses.
Comstock will passively own approximately 9.5% of the Sierra Springs Opportunity Fund Inc. Mr. De Gasperis and a diverse team of qualified financial, capital markets, real estate and operational professionals will govern, lead and manage the fund, its investments and operations. The fund owns 100% of Sierra Springs Enterprises Inc., a qualified opportunity zone business (the “QOZ-B”), that has secured and consolidated the rights mentioned above, all located in northern Nevada.
Outlook
The Company’s 2020 gross operating expenses are planned at approximately $4.0 million, excluding depreciation and discretionary exploration expenses. As of June 1, 2019, the Company has been and expects to continue receiving monthly reimbursements from Tonogold totaling approximately $2.2 million for the full year 2020, resulting in net operating expenses of approximately $2.8 million. The Company plans on eliminating its debt through announced asset sales, and does not expect any interest expense for the full year 2020.
During 2019, total gross operating expenses are expected at approximately $5.0 million, with Tonogold reimbursements expected at $1.6 million for the full year, plus $0.3 million in interest reimbursements for 2019.
For the remainder of 2019, Comstock’s plans include advancing the commercialization of MCU’s mercury remediation processing technologies. Oro has commenced manufacturing the 2-to-25 ton per hour mercury recovery plant and recently completed the critical “reverse-helix spiral concentrator” component of the system. The entire system will be mounted on three separate trailers and will be set up on the Company’s fully contained, double-lined processing area during the fourth quarter with an expected start date in January 2020. MCU will also identify sample locations within the Carson River Mercury Superfund Site (“CRMSS”) that will be sampled per an EPA-approved and updated Sampling and Analysis Plan (“SAP”). Once suitable sites have been identified, bulk samples will be extracted and transported to the MCU mercury remediation system located at the Company’s American Flat processing facility. MCU has also ordered the 200 gallon-per-minute dissolved air flotation (“DAF”) water treatment plant, also scheduled for delivery in December 2019.
The Company plans on commencing trial operations in January 2020, to validate and fine-tune MCU’s process, which has the potential for reclamation and remediation of its existing properties, enhance the values of, and potential economic feasibilities for, these properties and present new global growth opportunities in mercury remediation by demonstrating MCU’s technological effectiveness and efficiency.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company expects to close on the agreed upon sale of certain non-mining assets located in Silver Springs, NV, to Sierra Springs Enterprises Inc., for total net proceeds of $10.1 million. The agreements were signed in September 2019, with deposits currently in escrow. The Company also expects to close on the sale of 50.3% of the membership interest in Comstock Mining LLC, owner of the Lucerne properties, after receiving an additional $3.625 million in cash from Tonogold in October 2019. The agreement allows them to earn up to 100% of Comstock Mining LLC, after receiving an additional $3.95 million in installment payments in 2020.
The Dayton resource area is the Company’s top wholly-owned exploration and mine development target. The Company is developing a completely new geological interpretation for an updated resource estimate. The new geological interpretation is also being used to design phased drilling programs with higher potential for additional mineral resources. The Company plans to issue a new, stand-alone Dayton resource technical report, followed by a preliminary economic assessment in the fourth quarter 2020.
Mr. Corrado De Gasperis, concluded, “The benefits and value being positioned with MCU, Dayton, Spring Valley, Tonogold and the Sierra Springs Opportunity Fund and all of our strategic ventures will be showcased during our annual meeting, scheduled for November 12, 2019, at the Gold Hill Hotel in Gold Hill, Nevada. We look forward to overviewing our strategy, execution plans and introducing our shareholders to our partners and other stakeholders.”

Il digitale mette il turbo all’industria del payment. E accende la corsa fra investitori. In palio l’ingresso in un mercato da 1,9 trilioni, spinto dalle nuove forme di e-payment che stanno sostituendo il cash e promettono revenue stellari. Nel 2018 gli investitori hanno iniettato nel settore 18,5 miliardi di dollari, una cifra superiore di quasi cinque volte quella dell’anno precedente, anche se spalmata su un numero minore di contratti (235 lo scorso anno contro i 258 del 2017). E secondo la società Pitchbook nel 2019 il settore ha già attirato 2 miliardi di dollari.
Campione degli investitori la cinese Ant Financial Services Group, ex Alipay, che ha immesso risorse nel settore per 14 miliardi di dollari, nel 2018.
“Nonostante il numero di contratti sia diminuito leggermente si tratta di un mercato molto sano – dicono gli analisti di PitchBook -. Al centro della scena ora ci sono le aziende in grado non solo di semplificare i pagamenti per le piccole e medie imprese, ma anche di gestire la complessità dei pagamenti transfrontalieri”.
Si inseriscono nella nuova corsa all’oro i 345 milioni raccolti da Stripe nel suo ultimo round di investimento (valutazione di 22,5 miliardi): Stripe è una startup tecnologica della Silicon Valley che produce software per l’e-payment. Ancora, 100 milioni raccolti con un internal round da Klarna con il modello Try-before-you-pay (consente al cliente di posticipare il pagamento), mentre GoCardless ha ricevuto un’iniezione in contanti da 75 milioni da Alphabet e Salesforce .
Super-vivace anche il versante M&A: la società di tecno-finanza Usa Global Payments sta per firmare un accordo per l’acquisizione di Total System Services pari per circa 20 miliardi. Senza parlare della “piccola” startup britannica del fintech Checkout che ha raccolto 200 milioni di dollari (valore di mercato 2 miliardi), inserendosi così di diritto nel “club” degli unicorni europei.
Ancora, la svedese iZettle – startup fintech che fornisce strumenti per il mobile payment alle piccole e medie imprese – è stata acquisita l’anno scorso da PayPal per 2.2 miliardi di dollari (poco prima dell’Ipo).
Nel frattempo, la giapponese SoftBank sta spingendo il suo fondo d’investimenti Vision Fund verso il fintech: sul piatto 100 miliardi di dollari per Wirecard, startup di fintech tedesca.

Conor McGregor may make millions for every fight, but the average UFC fighter doesn’t. When it comes to pay, UFC fighters have a different experience than other athletes. Here’s a breakdown of the ways a UFC fighter gets money in the bank.
UFC fighters’ base pay
Every fighter has a base salary they receive for making weight and fighting. As the MMA Guru explains, the base amount depends on several factors. Each UFC fighter is considered an independent contractor and they’re free to negotiate with the UFC on the base pay. Usually, the more popular the fighter, the higher it is.
For example, Nate Diaz got a $20,000 base salary in his fight against Michael Johnson. However, after Diaz choked out McGregor and became a superstar, he renegotiated his salary. In his last fight, he got $250,000 to show up and fight Anthony Pettis.
Base pay also includes a win bonus, which usually only applies to fighters who don’t have a high base pay. For example, in the Johnson fight, Diaz had a $20,000 win bonus, so his actual base salary was $40,000. In the Pettis fight though, Diaz didn’t have a win bonus in his contract, so he just got $250,000 for fighting.
Sponsorships and endorsements
In 2015, the UFC signed an exclusive sponsorship deal with Reebok. This made Reebok the exclusive sponsor for UFC fighters during fight night. Fight night is the most lucrative time for sponsors since that’s when everyone’s watching. As a result, many UFC fighters have no sponsors other than Reebok.
To make up for that, Reebok pays the UFC, which in turn pays each fighter an amount based on how many fights they’ve had in the UFC. This Reebok sponsorship pay is minuscule, and it can range from $3,500 per fight to $40,000, according to the MMA Guru.
Endorsements are lucrative for UFC fighters but they’re mostly reserved for the most popular fighters. And of course, the more popular the fighter, the more endorsement money they’ll make. Because of this, though, it’s impossible to know what the average endorsement deal pays.
UFC bonuses, fines, and PPV points
Not to be confused with win bonuses, performance bonuses are awarded after a fight card ends. Usually, there’s one “fight of the night” bonus and two “performance of the night” bonuses per event. Four people get awarded a bonus, and each one pays $50,000. Sometimes, one person will get two bonuses and receive an extra $100,000.
Then there are backroom bonuses, which is money the UFC pays the fighters behind closed doors. Because of this, it’s unknown what that number looks like. Fines are technically another way to make money in the UFC. If your opponent misses weight, then they’ll be fined a portion of their salary. This fine will usually go to the other fighter.
Finally, pay-per-view, or PPV points, are another way a UFC fighter can make millions. Like endorsement deals, very few people will get PPV points. When a fighter gets PPV points, it just means a small percentage of the money that audiences pay for a PPV will go to the fighter. PPV points are usually reserved for champions and popular fighters.
How Conor McGregor gets paid
When he lost to Khabib Nurmagomedov, McGregor had a base salary of $3,000,000 as well as $40,000 from the Reebok sponsorship. His PPV points, however, allowed him to make almost $50,000,000 from the fight.
In terms of endorsements, the MMA Guru estimates that McGregor gets about $25,000,000 a year from his deals. However, he and other well-paid fighters like Alistair Overeem and Mark Hunt are the exception. Most UFC fighters will not make millions per year.

HAYWARD — Residents and businesses will likely see a rate increase in what they are paying for water and sewer services later this year.
The proposed bimonthly fee for fixed water service, a flat charge based on a meter’s size, will go up $4 during the next fiscal year for typical home and business customers, under a proposed rate hike.
The rate would increase another $4 for each bimonthly bill the following fiscal year.
That would bring the fixed water service fee for the typical meter up to $28 in fiscal year 2019 and $32 the next fiscal year. The current fee is $24.
No increases are proposed for water usage charges, which are based on how much water a customer uses.
City employees also are recommending a 4.4 percent jump in the standard residential sewer rate over each of the next two fiscal years.
The current monthly fixed sewer charge for a house is $32.85 each month, or $65.70 every bimonthly billing period. The proposed increase would bring that charge up to $34.30 a month, or $68.60 per bill, starting next fiscal year, then to $35.81 a month, or $71.62 per billing period, the following fiscal year.
Combined fixed water and sewer charges would increase from the current $93.70 every two months to $96.60 the first year, and then to $103.62 the next. The total bill for a Hayward residential customer using 200 gallons of water a day would go up to $131.52 beginning in October, according to a staff report.
Unlike residential customers, commercial and business customers pay a sewer fee based on the volume and strength of their water discharge. They can expect an increase in their sewer bills over the next two fiscal years from 3.1 percent to 7.3 percent under the city’s plan, according to Public Works Director Alex Ameri.
The increases are aimed at keeping pace with the cost of securing and delivering water, as well as sewer collection, treatment and disposal, according to city staff.
The City Council, which still must approve the hikes, took no action when it was briefed on the proposed increases May 14.
Hayward purchases its water from the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System, which is managed by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.
Even if the proposed increases for the fixed water charge and for sewer rates are approved, Hayward customers will still pay less for those parts of their bills than people in some neighboring cities.
The East Bay Municipal Utility District charges a bimonthly fixed water fee of $52.46, for instance, and the Alameda County Water District $56.61, according to a city report.
Oakland residents pay $65.63 for sewer services at a house, while those in Castro Valley pay $38.17 and those in San Leandro pay $35.75, the report said. However, Oro Loma Sanitary District customers pay $22.92.
But while the fixed water rate may be lower for Hayward residents, their overall water bills are higher because the city’s water comes entirely via the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, which raised its rates 37 percent in fiscal years 2016 and 2017.
According to the report, the bimonthly cost for 200 gallons per day in Hayward is $131.52. It’s $125.13 in the Alameda County Water District and will be $130.05 under proposed rates at EBMUD.
Ameri told the council that costs for water in Hayward work out for a residential customer to about 15 cents for an eight-minute shower, 21 cents for a single load of laundry and 2 cents for a single toilet flush.
“Here we are delivering water at a penny or two a gallon, right into your home, clean and drinkable,” Councilman Al Mendall said. “That’s pretty impressive. Not too many private businesses can match that, in my opinion.”
If approved, the first round of increases will start Oct. 1.
Rates are calculated based on guidelines developed by the California State Water Resources Control Board.
“As much as I am frugal about a lot of these things — we all want to spend our hard-earned cash on something, let’s say a bit more fun — we know that rates are increasing across the board,” Councilwoman Aisha Wahab said.
A public hearing and a vote on the proposed rate hike will take place July 2.
Customers can submit a protest, which must be in writing, about the increases up until the closing of the hearing. Protests can be submitted or mailed to City of Hayward, Attn. City Clerk, 777 B St., Hayward, Calif., 94541.
Protests must include your name and either your address or water and/or sewer account number or numbers.
The proposed rate changes will not take effect if written protests are received from a majority of property owners and tenants responsible for paying utility bills.

Salary differentials are pay increases granted to teachers for credits earned beyond a bachelor's degree, including through CLEP exams. Other pedagogues or administrative titles may also receive differentials and should refer to their contracts for details. Each differential can add thousands of dollars to your annual earnings — permanently — and cumulative differentials can make a big difference in your earning power.
You must apply in order to receive differentials. To ensure that you receive pay retroactively from the date you earned the additional credits, you must apply within six months of earning the credit.
Qualifying for differentials
Differentials are included in the Teachers' Salary Schedule. Here is a brief summary of the differentials as they appear on the chart:
C1 : This is the basic salary for those who have only a bachelor’s degree.
This is the basic salary for those who have only a bachelor’s degree. C1 +PD: This column applies only to teachers hired before 1970.
This column applies only to teachers hired before 1970. C2 : This is called the first differential. It requires 30 credits beyond the bachelor’s degree requirement. These may be all excess undergraduate credits, all graduate credits, or a combination of both.
This is called the first differential. It requires 30 credits beyond the bachelor’s degree requirement. These may be all excess undergraduate credits, all graduate credits, or a combination of both. C2 +ID: This column, the intermediate differential (ID), applies to people who have earned their first differential and in addition have 60 credits beyond the bachelor’s.
This column, the intermediate differential (ID), applies to people who have earned their first differential and in addition have 60 credits beyond the bachelor’s. C2 +PD: This is called the promotional differential or PD. It requires 36 credits in an approved subject matter area; those 36 credits may be undergraduate, graduate, or a combination. Generally speaking, you qualify when you get your master’s degree.
This is called the promotional differential or PD. It requires 36 credits in an approved subject matter area; those 36 credits may be undergraduate, graduate, or a combination.

C2 +ID+PD: This is for people who have met the requirements for the first differential, the intermediate differential and the promotional differential.
This is for people who have met the requirements for the first differential, the intermediate differential and the promotional differential. C6 +PD: This is the second differential. It can be achieved in several ways: With a master’s degree plus another 30 credits that were taken after the date of your bachelor’s but not as part of your master’s credits. The credits can be from undergraduate or graduate courses. With professional development courses and/or activities approved by the chancellor. By getting National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification.
This is the second differential. It can be achieved in several ways:
PLEASE NOTE: Non-degree career and technical education teachers follow a different path for obtaining differentials. This chart shows the salary differential eligibility requirements for CTE teachers.
Applying for differentials
Differentials are not automatically awarded. You must apply for them in order to recieve a salary raise. To ensure you receive your differential from the date you earn the additional credits, you must apply within six months of earning the credit.
Differentials are paid as of Feb. 1, July 1 and Sept. 1, respectively, for work you’ve completed in the previous fall, spring and summer semesters.
For example, if you complete your coursework by Jan. 31 and file by July 31, the DOE will pay your differential in the fall semester with arrears back to Feb. 1.
The DOE’s differential application process
The DOE’s Office of Salary Services (OSS), uses an online salary differential application process for all teachers.
You must have a DOE email address to access the online application.
Access the salary differential online application »
See a step-by-step guide to applying for a differential in the DOE's salary application system »
Once the online application is completed, the application must be printed. A tracking number is assigned to the application. Transcripts still must be submitted to the DOE.
Original transcripts along with the application are to be submitted to 65 Court Street, Room 102, Brooklyn, New York 11201. Members who hand-deliver their application will get a receipt. The DOE strongly suggests that members send their applications return receipt if they cannot hand-deliver them.
Members will electronically receive a Certificate of Salary Status when the differential is processed.
With this new online process, members no longer need to resubmit their transcript each time they apply for another differential.
Get help applying
The UFT provides assistance to members in completing salary differential applications. As a first step, you should speak with your school’s chapter leader. If you still have questions after you speak with your chapter leader, the UFT has five borough offices, which are open on school days between the hours of 3:30 p.m. and 6 p.m.

The Arizona House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill allowing companies to pay some employees less than the state minimum wage.
The proposal would allow employers to pay workers who are under 22 years old, full-time high school or college students, and who work less than 20 hours a week up to three dollars less an hour than is mandated by state law.
The bill passed on 30-29 party-line vote. Democrats called it discriminatory.
"Discriminating against those who are 22 and under, saying that you are not worthy to make a good wage. Let's call it what it really is: separating classes of service," said Democrat Richard Andrade of Glendale.
Backers of the bill said it allows students to get a foothold in the working world because they become affordable.
"I support the idea that we need to give our youth a foothold in the employment workplace," said Republican Mark Finchem from Oro Valley.
In 2016, Arizona voters approved increasing the minimum wage to $12 per hour by 2020. At the time, business groups said the mandated increase would hurt the state economy.
In the third quarter of 2018, Arizona's economy grew at 3 percent, according to economists at the University of Arizona. The national economic growth rate for the same period was 1.7 percent.
The bill still needs approval by the Senate and Gov. Doug Ducey.
This article was updated Thursday afternoon following the vote for approval by the Arizona House.

Barrie-Springwater-Oro-Medonte NDP candidate Dan Janssen says his party is working for all residents, as well as the environment.
He launched his campaign for the Oct. 21 federal election during an event in downtown Barrie on Sunday afternoon.
The former Anten Mills resident, who now resides in east-end Barrie, is a self-described community organizer and labour advocate.
Janssen told supporters he believes in a Canada that works for everyone.
“We’re asking businesses to pay their fair share,” he said. “It’s not too much to ask so that the rest of us can have the services that we should have in our public so we can all have the opportunity to succeed.”
Janssen said the party is looking at closing tax loopholes.
“Really, only the wealthy have access to those tax loopholes, not the rest of us,” he said. “Putting forward a plan like that can actually help the rest of us make our lives a little more affordable.”
Janssen said the party’s platform for more affordable housing and a pharma-care plan, including dental and eye care, will appeal to Canadians.
“It will not only save them money, but also small businesses, too,” he said of the drug plan.
“People will no longer have to pull out their credit card to pay for medications they may need, especially if they don’t have it through their benefits plan at work.”
Improvements to mental health care and addiction services are also priorities, he added.
“It (can be) very difficult (for families) and I think our country has a responsibility to look after all of its citizens,” Janssen said.
The NDP would also hold the next two election cycles as proportional representation, “so Canadians have the opportunity to see how the program works,” he said.
“After those two elections, the NDP would hold a referendum so (voters) could make an informed decision about our voting process.”

After an extensive search for a new mineral asset Oro Verde (ASX: OVL) emerged from a trading suspension this morning with news it was acquiring a 60% stake in the Makuutu rare earths project in Uganda from Rwenzori Metals Ltd.
The news comes after Oro decided to withdraw from its option to acquire the Topacio gold project in Nicaragua late last year due to ongoing civil unrest in the region.
In securing Makuutu, Oro noted that Uganda was a mining-friendly country and the project is one of the few large ionic clay-hosted rare earth element projects outside of China.
Makuutu has three licences that encompass 132 square kilometres about 40km east of the country’s regional centre Jinja.
According to Oro, the area has “excellent” infrastructure, with tarred roads, nearby rail, power, water, cell-phone coverage and is accessible in all weather conditions.
“We have searched extensively and very selectively for the company’s next project and are very excited by this new acquisition,” Oro director Dr Marc Steffens said.
“Makuutu has the potential to be a substantive and significant project with a favourable REE mix, that is located strategically outside of China in a mining-friendly jurisdiction.”
“Additionally, we believe we have an excellent project partner in Rwenzori’s existing management and technical teams, and look forward to further developing this opportunity together,” Dr Steffens added.
Makuutu REE project
Oro pointed out the ionic clay-type REE deposits were the cheapest and most accessible source of heavy rare earth oxides (HREO).
The company said in these types of deposits the HREO can be extracted through rudimentary mining and processing methods.
Additionally, preliminary metallurgical test work on a sample of Makuutu ore has confirmed the material’s “favourable” metallurgy and extraction capabilities.
Oro has 30 days to undertake due diligence at the project to confirm Rwenzori’s previous work including ground gravity and radiometric surveys, metallurgical analysis results, geological modelling and a non-JORC resource.
Once due diligence has verified Rwenzori’s data, Oro plans to fast-track the project to development, with an infill and extensional drilling program to begin immediately that will underpin a JORC resource and provide samples for further metallurgical test work.
The deal
Under the deal, Oro will pay US$10,000 (A$14,240), which gives it the 30-day exclusive option period.
If Oro elects to proceed with the acquisition, it will pay the vendors US$100,000 (A$142,360) in cash and issue a further US$150,000 (A$213,540)-worth of Oro shares.
Additionally, Oro will contribute US$1.7 million (A$2.42 million) towards advancing the project by October 2020, with this expenditure giving Oro a 51% stake.
Oro must then fund a bankable feasibility study to completion to lock-in the full 60% interest.
The transaction also includes Oro making US$1.5 million (A$2.14 million) in milestone payments, which can be made in either cash or shares.
The company has already secured A$600,000 in immediate funding via a share placement, which will pay for Oro’s near-term project commitments.
Investors reacted positively to the acquisition news, with Oro’s share price up 150% to A$0.005 by late morning trade.

Il colpo di scena porta la data del due settembre. Un uomo incappucciato, con una pistola in pugno, in pantaloncini e con indosso una felpa grigia dice di essere a conoscenza dei mandanti dell’omicidio di Fabrizio Piscitelli, 53 anni. È a volto coperto ma declina le sue generalità: «Mi chiamo Fabio Gaudenzi, sono nato a Roma il 3 marzo 1972». Alle spalle una foto, un gruppo di ultras fuori dallo stadio San Siro a Milano e la scritta “Opposta Fazione”. È la frangia neonazista del tifo giallorosso. È un video delirante.
Gaudenzi, soprannominato lo “Zoppo”, ben conosce la mala romana, è stato condannato per usura a 2 anni e 8 mesi nell’inchiesta mondo di mezzo. Amico e tirapiedi di Massimo Carminati è in ottimi rapporti anche con Piscitelli. Con loro condivide la fede politica, di estrema destra. Ciò che dice a tratti è farneticante: «Apparteniamo al gruppo storico dei fascisti di Roma Nord». Di questa sigla non c’è alcuna traccia. Ad ogni modo è chiaro che voglia essere arrestato. Ha in pugno un’arma e promette vendetta: «Ricordatevi tutti che lo Zoppo non dimentica». In poco tempo la polizia gli piomba a casa, finisce in manette e poi a Rebibbia in attesa di essere sentito dai pm della Dda Giovanni Muasarò e Nadia Plastina. Lui dice di voler parlare solo con Nicola Gratteri, procuratore capo a Catanzaro e storico conoscitore della ‘ndrangheta.
LE MAFIE
Lo “Zoppo”, in questo modo sembra, implicitamente, suggerire una pista che porta alla mafia calabrese. Un’ipotesi, a dire il vero, che gli investigatori stavano già battendo così come quella della camorra. Di fatto l’assassinio compiuto con quella modalità è tipico della criminalità organizzata, tant’è che i magistrati avevano, da subito, deciso di aprire il fascicolo per omicidio con l’aggravante mafiosa. Come accade nei posti in cui la mafia è di casa, anche attorno all’omicidio Diabolik, si alza un muro di omertà.

Nessuno parla con gli investigatori, tutti stanno zitti soprattutto gli amici negli ambienti ultras che più di tutti, a parole, chiedono giustizia. Nessuno si presenta in procura, nemmeno i familiari, per cercare di costruire nei dettagli i rapporti di amicizia di Piscitelli. Il suo storico autista agli agenti della squadra mobile dice: «Arrestatemi, io non so niente». Muto insomma. E in silenzio rimangono anche i tre cellulari di Diabolik, nessuno fornisce un minimo aiuto per decriptarli. Eppure nelle ultime chiamate potrebbe nascondersi il nome dell’uomo che lo ha tradito facendolo cadere nella trappola che gli è costata la vita: l’appuntamento al parco degli Acquedotti. La procura, perciò, è costretta ad affidare gli smartphone ad una società estera nella speranza di riuscire ad esfiltrare i dati.

D’altro canto un omicidio così brutale e plateale fa paura a molti e porta con sé un duplice messaggio, oltre ad eliminare un soggetto ingombrante che ha compiuto uno sgarbo, rappresenta anche una prova di forza che può avere questo significato: “non provate a reagire siamo forti”. Un assassinio che solo un’organizzazione criminale ben strutturata poteva pianificare ed eseguire, un killer travestito da runner che spara e corre via tranquillo. Tanto più che la zona del parco degli Acquedotti, dove Diabolik è stato freddato alle 18.50 del 7 agosto, è una fetta di territorio su cui la camorra esercita il controllo. Perciò, ragionano gli investigatori, l’omicidio forse si sarebbe consumato quanto meno con l’assenso dei napoletani. Anche se una prima smentita arriva dal capoluogo campano. In città, il padre di Michele Senese, l’anziano Vincenzo, piange la morte di Diabolik.
D’altro canto Michele o’ pazzo era l’uomo, secondo i rapporti del Gico della finanza e del Ros dei carabinieri, con cui era in affari Diabolik. Piscitelli, in un rapporto di subalternità, si interfacciava con un boss di spessore della camorra. Il punto, però, è che il 27 giugno 2013 Senese veniva arrestato. Quattro mesi dopo finiva in cella anche Diabolik con l’accusa di importare hashish dalla Spagna. Tuttavia Michele o’ pazzo finiva in carcere, rinchiuso in regime di 41 bis, con la previsione di uscirne in un tempo indefinito. Mentre Piscitelli, a luglio del 2017, era un uomo libero, ma con meno agganci robusti, rispetto a prima, a Roma.
La Capitale è una giungla i cui equilibri criminali cambiano velocemente, nell’arco di mesi. Di tutto può essere accaduto nei 4 anni passati da Diabolik tra domiciliari e carcere.
GAUDENZI
In questo clima di omertà è appunto Gaudenzi a spiazzare tutti. Una deposizione che non ha convinto del tutto gli inquirenti. Quando l’uomo si siede di fronte ai pm fornisce una teoria che nessuno, fino a quel momento, aveva ipotizzato: «Non si tratta di droga», sottolinea sicuro. «È una questione di oro».
In realtà questa vicenda veniva trattata marginalmente nell’inchiesta mondo di mezzo, senza che la figura di Piscitelli venisse lambita. Lo Zoppo, però lo tira dentro. E spiega di averlo coinvolto lui in questo affare dopo essere stato imbrogliato da Filippo Maria Macchi. Gaudenzi si sarebbe esposto per recuperare parte del denaro, prestato dagli amici “camerati”, Massimo Carminati, Riccardo Brugia e i fratelli Bracci, per acquistare nel 2014 tre quintali d’oro in Africa. Macchi sarebbe scomparso con il metallo prezioso e i soldi, lasciando Gaudenzi in un mare di guai. Gli unici ad aiutarlo sarebbero stati due “camerati” Maurizio Terminali e Fabrizio Piscitelli. Il primo gli avrebbe detto che Macchi si trovava a Siena, salvo poi morire per overdose a fine giugno, «assassinato» per Gaudenzi. Mentre Diabolik gli avrebbe comunicato che il suo uomo era ad Anzio, salvo poi essere sparato.
Questa insomma la versione dello Zoppo. Per ora l’unico che ha parlato, nella speranza che altri coraggiosi si facciano avanti per disvelare il mistero dell’omicidio di Diabolik.

The United States men’s and women’s soccer teams have had an excellent summer. The women won their fourth World Cup and continued their dominance on the international stage, while the men regained much needed respect with a 2nd place finish in the CONCACAF Gold Cup. These on-field accomplishments will be taken in over time, but it was also an important summer for agendas off the field. Most notably present throughout the World Cup was the discussion of how the men and women are paid.
After the women bask in the moment they inspired, they will enter into mediation with US Soccer to address the lawsuit related to equal pay between the men and women. The women are not paid as much as the men for the same work and level of competition. The issue is complicated by the fact that governing bodies like CONCACAF and FIFA set bonus pools for their tournaments which are outside of the decision making authority of US Soccer.
The women collectively earned $4 million for their World Cup final victory, while the men earned approximately $500,000 for their second place Gold Cup finish (The 2019 Gold Cup pool was not announced but the 2nd place finisher received $500,000 in both the 2015 and 2017 versions). The top Gold Cup payout for the last two tournaments was $1 million, meaning there was a 4-to-1 ratio established for the winners of each tournament.
FIFA estimates that over 1 billion people tuned into this iteration of the Women’s World Cup. Global viewership for the regionally focused Gold Cup is not available, but a fair comparison would be to examine last year’s Men’s World Cup. FIFA reported that total viewership reached nearly 3.6 billion. But when you consider that the men’s bonus pool was over thirteen times larger than the women’s, the rationale for such a large pay disparity falls apart. The men’s pool in 2018 was $400 million, while the total women’s pool was $30 million this year.
Restricting interest to just the United States, the scale still favors the women. The women’s quarterfinal match against France was watched by over 6.1 million people, in the awkward 3pm EST timeslot, while the English speaking comparison for the men’s quarterfinal victory over Curacao was 1.55 million on a Sunday night. Over the course of their final three games the women tallied 27 million viewers for Fox.
Conspicuously, the semifinal and final figures for the US men have been unavailable publicly. In the Seattle-Tacoma market the women pulled a 12.7 rating for the Women’s final while the men pulled a 3.0, a similar ratio the quarterfinal.
Viewership is of course not the only way to measure interest, and the women have also proven their ability to drive the bottom line. The home women’s jersey has eclipsed all sales records, men’s or women’s, for Nike, and is up over 500% versus the last World Cup on Fanatics.
While this tournament was a good sign of a rebuild for the men, it was a game changer for the US women, who only continue to reach new levels of popularity and inspire the coming generation of soccer players. Unfortunately, they must now shift to an off-field competition where not just equal pay but fair pay for women is at stake, and hopefully they will be able to use this large platform to raise the awareness of this disturbing issue.

How much will I earn?
The union negotiates regular pay increases, as well as differentials, step payments and longevity increases based on your level of education and your years of service.
The amount of your paycheck depends on:
The salary schedule that the union and the DOE negotiate in the contract.
Years of approved prior teaching experience outside the New York City Department of Education and other eligible non-teaching experience.
How long you have been teaching in the New York City Department of Education.
Credits and degrees you earn beyond your bachelor's degree.
The salary schedule allows you to increase your earnings as you gain experience and accumulate undergraduate or graduate credits or a master’s degree depending on your title. New members with different educational credentials and amounts of prior experience may start at different rates of pay.
The chart shows three common examples of starting annual salaries:
Teacher Salary
Step Differential Annual pay
as of
May 1, 2015 BA degree, no experience 1A C1 $49,908 Master's degree, no experience 1A C2 +PD $56,103 Master's degree, plus 30 credits and
7 1/2 years credited experience 8B C6 +PD $78,604
How to read the salary schedule
The UFT salary schedule allows you to earn more money as you spend more time on the job (in what are called steps) and as you earn more education credits (in what are called differentials).
Salary steps
A salary step is an incremental increase in salary based on previous qualifying professional experience. They are listed vertically down the left-hand side of each salary schedule. An employee will move one step for each semester of satisfactory service. You'll earn more money the longer you stay in the system.
If you teach without interruption, you can move through the steps at the rate of two steps per year (e.g., 1A and 1B) for each year you work, increasing your earnings up to Step 8B. You will automatically receive pay increases based on your anniversary/equated date of hire and on March 1.
All newly hired teachers, as well as members of functional chapters such as school secretaries, must report their prior work experience in their online application (TSN) for employment. Members who have not entered any previous work experience will automatically be placed on the beginning salary step and granted an equated date that coincides with their first day of employment.
Longevity increases
Teachers will receive "longevity" increments after teaching in New York City for five, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20 and 22 years. A longevity increase becomes part of the teacher's base salary and is immediately pensionable.
Differentials
Salary differentials are granted to teachers who earn credits beyond a bachelor’s degree, including CLEP exams.They are listed horizontally across the top of each salary schedule. You may be entitled to more than one differential at a time.
Each differential can add thousands of dollars to your annual earnings — permanently — and cumulative differentials can make a big difference in your earning power. Teachers and members in functional chapters can accumulate credits to qualify for salary differentials by taking courses through the UFT Teacher Center. Contact the UFT for more information.
You must apply in order to receive differentials. To ensure that you receive pay retroactively from the date you earned the additional credits, you must apply within six months of earning the credit.
Titles other than teachers can also receive salary differentials and should refer to their contracts or contact their borough office for details.
Differentials in the salary chart
Here is a brief summary of the teacher differentials, and how they appear on the UFT salary charts:
C1: This is the basic salary for those who have only a bachelor’s degree.
C1+PD: This column applies only to teachers hired before 1970.
C2: This is called the first differential. It requires 30 credits beyond the bachelor’s degree requirement. These may be all excess undergraduate credits, all graduate credits, or a combination of both.
C2+ID: This column, the intermediate differential (ID), applies to people who have earned their first differential and in addition have 60 credits beyond the bachelor’s.
C2+PD: This is called the promotional differential or PD. It requires 36 credits in an approved subject matter area; those 36 credits may be undergraduate, graduate, or a combination. Generally speaking, you qualify when you get your master’s degree.
C2+ID+PD: This is for people who have met the requirements for the first differential, the intermediate differential and the promotional differential.
C6+PD: This is the second differential. It can be achieved in several ways:
With a master’s degree plus another 30 credits that were taken after the date of your bachelor’s but not as part of your master’s credits. The credits can be from undergraduate or graduate courses.
With professional development courses and/or activities approved by the chancellor.
By getting National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification.
Do you have prior experience?
All newly hired teachers must report their prior work experience in their online application for employment. The information will automatically be submitted to the DOE’s new online salary step application which must be validated by the teacher via the DOE’s payroll portal. It takes approximately two to four weeks for the DOE to evaluate your prior work experience if you are a newly appointed teacher. You will receive a Certificate of Salary Status via email informing you of your salary step up to Step 8B if eligible and a new equated date.
If you have no previous work experience, you will automatically be placed on Step 1A and your equated date will be your hiring date for moving up in salary steps.
Non-appointed teachers will also receive a Certificate of Salary Status via email but will not receive an equated date. The highest salary step that a regular substitute teacher can attain credit for, even if certified, is Step 4A.
School secretaries, guidance counselors, social workers and psychologists: You can earn salary credits for approved outside service.
Therapists and therapist supervisors do not have steps, but have experience differentials that can translate into outside credit. Therapists also receive longevity increases at five, seven, 10, 15, 20 and 22 years.
Nurses and nurse supervisors do not have steps, but have experience differentials that can translate into outside credit. Nurses/supervisors also receive longevity increases at five, seven, 10, 15, 20 and 22 years.
Education analysts/officers do not have steps or education differentials, but they do have longevities that are earned upon completing five, 10, 15 and 20 years.
Paraprofessionals do not have steps, but they do have longevities that are earned upon completing five and 15 years. They have a combination of education and experience requirements to advance in title.
Check with your school’s UFT chapter leader or call a salary rep at your UFT borough office for more information on steps and differentials.

The Spanish government has approved a legislative decree that aims to fight against gender discrimination in the workplace.
The decree, passed by the Cabinet of Socialist Party (PSOE) Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Friday, includes the progressive equalization of paternity leave with maternity leave, which will grant new fathers up to 16 weeks of time off work by 2021.
Businesses must complete a gender audit on the average salary of male and female employees
It also demands that Spanish businesses complete a gender audit with the “average salary values, salary supplements and non-wage benefits of their staff, separated by sex” that can be accessed by worker representatives and union members. The goal of the registry is to highlight whether there is female under representation or a gender wage gap.
To improve representation, a greater number of companies must implement gender equality plans under the decree. At present, companies with 250 or more employees must have a plan, but this will be extended over the next three years. In the first year, the plan must be adopted by companies with 150 or more employees, in the second year by companies with 100 or more employees and in the third year by those with 50 or more. This plan must address issues such as the selection and hiring process, work conditions and preventing sexual harassment.
Pay gap in Spain
Men and women who perform similar tasks in the workplace do not earn the same in Spain. Women’s hourly earnings are 12.7% lower than men’s, according to a 2017 study that is based on statistically adjusted EU data from 2014.
The gap exists across variables such as age, education, years of service, occupation, type of contract, length of working day, activity and company size. According to the decree, the pay gap ”has not been reduced in the past years.”
The decree adds that “public equality policies must remove obstacles that block women from accessing and developing in science, research and technology sectors.”

Fine jewelry will nearly always cost a bit more than the costume variety, but that doesn’t you have to go bankrupt for the ring or necklace of your dreams.
Brands and retailers like Catbird, Mejuri, AUrate New York, The Last Line, and Vrai & Oro are changing the game with hip, affordable, and high-quality pieces. These are truly not your grandmothers’ jewels.
The phrase “fine jewelry” makes me think of super-wealthy women draped head-to-toe in diamonds or over-the-top family heirlooms. But sometimes, you want a really special piece, whether it’s to commemorate a special occasion or simply to stand up to daily wear and look good with everything in your closet.
Well, the internet is disrupting everything, the fine jewelry market included. Not only are there many affordable fine jewelry brands cropping up, to offer quality pieces in cool silhouettes, but the products are also often made with an emphasis on sustainable materials. The ethical concerns when buying real jewels, especially diamonds, are very real. Many newer brands claim to have made responsible sourcing a top priority and focus on transparency in their business models.
Of course, “affordable” is relative, but it’s absolutely possible to get quality gold and silver jewelry for less than $1,000 these days, as well as sustainable diamonds that are reasonably priced. You just have to know where to look. These direct-to-consumer brands minimize markup to keep prices down and pay close attention to design. Many of them have pieces that cost less than $100, if you’re willing to skip the fancy stones. Happy jewelry shopping!

The best overall
source Catbird
Catbird carries a wide selection of cool brands as well as in-house designs, with prices ranging from less than $100 to upward of $1,000 and higher.
Catbird, the Brooklyn, New York-based company best known for dainty stackable rings, carries pieces from trendy brands like Bittersweets NY and WWAKE alongside its namesake collection. The selection is great for minimalists, maximalists, and everyone in between.
Prices are wide-ranging – everything from $35 for a tiny pearl ring to $4,480 for the Three Cosmos Ring. While rings are Catbird’s bread and butter, you can also find necklaces, earrings, bracelets, anklets, and lifestyle items like candles and paper goods. Quirky-cool couples will love the selection of unconventional engagement rings and wedding bands made with materials like black or grey diamonds.
Catbird has a few locations in Brooklyn, but most of us will shop at its impressive website. According to the retailer, all the brands Catbird stocks with claim to use recycled gold and conflict-free gemstones.
Pros: Wide selection, conflict-free stones, recycled gold, wide price range
Cons: More ring options than other types of jewelry
The best for minimalists
source Mejuri
Mejuri offers simple, dainty pieces designed to be worn daily but affordable enough to mix and match.
If you follow a bunch of influencers on Instagram, you’ve probably seen jewelry from Mejuri. The brand specializes in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it pieces that won’t get in the way of your daily life – whisper-thin necklaces and vintage-looking signet rings that you’ll never want to take off.
I know it’s cool to compare every millennial-friendly company with Everlane, but these two brands really do have quite a bit in common, including pitch-perfect basics, razor-sharp design focus, and transparent pricing. Mejuri lists the estimated traditional retail price of each piece next to the price you’ll pay. It makes you feel like you’re getting a discount even though you’re technically not.
But you won’t need a discount at these prices. Think gold vermeil hoop earrings for $60, a pavé diamond heart necklace for $295, and a topaz ring for $155. I have my eye on the Bound Chain Ear Cuff, which is only $35. The brand recently launched a collection of unique engagement rings and coordinating wedding bands.
Mejuri uses ethically-sourced diamonds and durable metals. Care instructions for all of the materials are found online at the brand’s website. The selection regularly updates with new offerings, and you can often get a sneak peek of upcoming launches at the “Coming Soon” tab.
Writers at Elle, Vox, and The Zoe Report are also fans of the brand’s clean staples, occasional statement pieces, and reasonable prices.
Pros: Minimalist pieces that go with everything, ethically sourced diamonds, transparent pricing
Cons: Only sold online (but you can try things on at the NYC showroom)
The best for sustainable diamonds
source AUrate New York
The people behind AUrate New York have rigorous standards when it comes to the materials they use – splurge on that diamond necklace, guilt-free.
Diamonds are not traditionally the best choice as far as sustainability or ethics goes. While most of the companies on this list focus on ethical sourcing, AUrate New York has a particular focus on diamonds that makes it unique.
“We’re fastidious about our diamonds,” the company says on its website. AUrate claims to pay close attention to the production of its gemstones, “adhere strictly to the Kimberly Process (the international system certifying conflict-free diamonds),” and “insist that the mines [they] deal with have decent working conditions, offer fair pay, respect local indigenous communities, and protect the environment.”
Style-wise, you can’t go wrong here either. Whether you’re searching for timeless diamond studs, a simple diamond bracelet, or an edgy evil eye ring, you can find it at AUrate. The brand also carries non-diamond styles if stones aren’t really your thing.
AUrate pieces come with a lifetime warranty and a try-on option called Curate by AUrate for guilt-free purchasing. As Elle explains, “Take a style quiz and AUrate will send you five pieces free of charge.” You then have seven days to test-drive the items and decide which to keep (yes, you do have to pay for those!).
Prices don’t run as low as some of the other brands here, but that’s in part because the focus is more on diamonds and other gemstones. There are fewer metal-only pieces.
Pros: Sustainable diamonds, classic styles, lifetime warranty, transparent pricing
Cons: Selection is small
The best for maximalists
source The Last Line
The Last Line takes the bright, colorful approach to fine jewelry with rings, bracelets, anklets, and more, rendered in a rainbow of stones.
Minimalist jewelry is certainly having a moment, but what if you’re all about bold accessories? Los Angeles-based The Last Line specializes in bright, colorful pieces. You can truly wear the rainbow when you shop the collection of earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and anklets.
The best-selling tennis bracelets are a great place to start. Opt for a simple row of white diamonds for $3,750 or choose from an array of colorful options, including the multicolored Perfect Tennis Bracelet for $1,450. Less expensive options include the Perfect Gold Ear Cuff for $185 and the Rainbow Zodiac Ring for $515.
“Consider these the start of your very own heirloom collection,” writes The Zoe Report’s Gina Marinelli. According to Elle, The Last Line has amassed quite a celebrity following, appearing on the likes of Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry.
The Last Line offers a financing program that allows you to pay off your baubles for low interest over a period of time in case those price tags really sting. Exchanges and returns for store credit are allowed, but only up to seven days after receipt.
Pros: Large selection, unique and colorful designs
Cons: Prices on the higher end
The best for wedding jewelry
source Vrai and Oro
Vrai & Oro has a modern take on classic engagement and wedding ring styles, made in Los Angeles and using sustainable methods.
Looking for a sustainable take on the classic diamond engagement ring, at reasonable prices? Vrai & Oro offers a selection in recognizable styles like The Solitaire, The Emerald, and The Round Bezel. The diamonds are stunning, and guilt-free, as each is lab grown in Silicon Valley by a company called Diamond Foundry.
These are “real diamonds with the same beautiful characteristics as mined diamonds,” per the website, but minus the negative ethical implications.
Vrai & Oro also has a number of wedding bands made with or without stones. Though it is an online-only retailer, the brand has an at-home try-on program. It allows you to sample three ring designs to determine your ideal style and size. The rings are also reasonably priced.
Not getting married anytime soon? The brand has a stunning collection of rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets for casual wear.
Pros: Lab-grown diamonds, classic engagement rings at reasonable prices, at home try-on
Cons: Online only

Il nuovo sistema di pagamento con smartphone di Google è da tempo utilizzabile anche in Italia. Parliamo chiaramente di Google Pay che da qualche mese anche nel nostro paese garantisce la possibilità di fare pagamenti tramite lo smartphone con la registrazione di alcune carte di pagamento con NFC. Ecco che la notizia interessante di oggi riguarda la possibilità di registrare anche carte Postepay appunto di Poste Italiane che dunque potranno essere utilizzate per il pagamento tramite smartphone.
Postepay e Google Pay: quali si potranno usare?
Purtroppo però non è tutto oro quello che luccica. Nel senso che sì, Poste Italiane, permetterà agli utenti di usufruire della novità e della comodità del pagamento tramite smartphone e dunque Google Pay, ma per farlo si avrà comunque la necessità di usare una carta abilitata. Infatti non tutte le carte presenti sul catalogo di Poste Italiane andranno bene e soprattutto la Postepay Standard non permetterà il pagamento con smartphone di Google.
Ecco che la maggior parte degli utenti che solitamente usano una Postepay posseggono proprio questo tipo di carta che però non beneficerà del supporto a Google Pay. Le carte abilitate invece saranno:
Carta Postepay CONNECT

Crispin Odey’s share of profit from Odey Asset Management is down £4m on last year
This article is more than 9 months old
This article is more than 9 months old
Crispin Odey’s share of the profit of his hedge fund has fallen by £4m, as various bets made by the Brexit-backing billionaire against the UK economy and British businesses failed to pay off.
Odey collected £1.5m from Odey Asset Management in the year to 5 April, a 72% decline on the £5.5m he made in the previous 12 months, according to accounts filed at Companies House.
The hedge fund he founded in 1991 reported a 52% fall in profit to £8.8m, as Odey’s bets against the pound and a raft of UK retailers failed to immediately bear fruit.
Odey Asset Management has declared £149m of short positions against UK shops, banks, estate agents and property companies.
However, the fund has performed strongly in recent months, as the pound has fallen further and the share prices of a number of British businesses Odey bet against have collapsed.
His fund has gained more than 50% so far this year, including a return of 7% in October, making it one of the world’s best-performing hedge funds, according to the Financial Times.
Last month, the fund made millions from a bet against the shopping centre owner Intu, shares in which plunged 42% after a proposed takeover collapsed. Odey also benefited from a £33m bet against Debenhams, which has had an 85% decline in its shares over the past year.
Odey was one of the most prominent supporters of the drive to leave the EU and donated almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns. He placed huge bets against the pound and government bonds in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum and made an estimated £220m profit when the pound collapsed following the leave victory.
The day after the vote, he told the BBC: “There’s that Italian expression – ‘Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca’ (the morning has gold in its mouth) and never has one felt so much that idea as this morning.”

Odey has boasted that each day of Brexit-related political crisis is a “good day” for him and his hedge fund. “I have had a good day,” he told the Times last month, on a day when the pound fell 2%. “Bad days tend to be good days for us.”
He has repeatedly called for Theresa May to resign as prime minister and said he would “love” Boris Johnson to replace her.

The 2019 Women’s World Cup has a total purse of $30 million, while the winning team makes $4 million, per CNBC. This is double the previous amount of $15 million in 2015.
The USA earned $2 million after their 2015 victory in the title match. It is unclear exactly how teams divide the purse money and if the coaching and training staff also receive a portion of the winnings. If the U.S. were to win the World Cup, the money would be about $173,913 per player if it were divided just among the athletes.
By comparison, the 2018 World Cup had a total purse of $400 million, per The New York Times.To put it in perspective, France took home a $38 million check for winning the 2018 World Cup, which is more than the entire Women’s World Cup purse. FIFA president Gianni Infantino recently proposed that the tournament expand to 32 teams and the prize money be doubled, potentially as soon as 2023.
“I want to expand the tournament to 32 teams,” Infantino said, per The Guardian. “We will have to act quickly to decide if we are to increase it for 2023, if we do, we should reopen the bidding process to allow everyone to have a chance or maybe co-host. Nothing is impossible.”
USWNT forward Megan Rapinoe discussed the discrepancy in prize money for the men’s and women’s World Cup. Rapinoe was also not pleased that the Gold Cup and Copa America finals were also on July 7.
“That’s what I mean,” Rapinoe noted to USA Today. “If you really care about each game in the same way, are you letting the gap grow? I’m not saying our prize money is $450 million this time or next time around. I understand that, for a lot of different reasons, the men’s game financially is far advanced to the women’s game. But if you really care, are you letting the gap grow? Are you scheduling three finals on the same day? No, you’re not.”
The USWNT Is Currently Part of an Ongoing Lawsuit Against the U.S. Soccer Federation
The USWNT is currently part of an ongoing lawsuit levied against the United States Soccer Federation that centers around equitable pay. During the World Cup, news broke that the two sides had agreed to mediation. U.S. Soccer released a statement on their “disappointment” that the news was shared during the World Cup.
“While we welcome the opportunity to mediate, we are disappointed the plaintiffs’ counsel felt it necessary to share this news publicly during the Women’s World Cup and create any possible distraction from the team’s focus on the tournament and success on the field,” U.S. Soccer said in a statement,” U.S. Soccer said, per Pro Soccer USA.
Alex Morgan is one of 28 players that are part of the lawsuit. Morgan noted that the group is hoping the lawsuit can impact all industries, not just sports.
“This isn’t just about us; It’s about women in all industries,” Morgan noted to Pro Soccer USA. “Women fight for equality every single day. Our hope is that we not only set up ourselves, we set up the next generation as well.”

According to the 2018 Simcoe County Living Wage Calculation, the average resident must make a minimum of $18.01 per hour to make ends meet
The living wage is creeping upward county-wide, according to a new report.
If you live in Simcoe County, you must be making a minimum of $18.01 per hour in order to be making a living wage, according to the 2018 Simcoe County Living Wage Calculation report prepared by county staff that was discussed at Simcoe County council this week, but some councillors took exception to the way the final amounts were tallied.
“Just a comment," remarked Ramara Mayor Basil Clarke. "Who is it that decided the work week is only 35 hours long? I don’t know anybody who works 35 hours a week.
"My son’s girlfriend has two part-time jobs and works more hours than this,” said Clarke.
“On top of that, whoever decided that your education should be covered by the income of your current job... that goes in the face of student loans. The idea is, you borrow the money, get an education and then your new job at a higher rate of pay is what pays for that education," said the Ramara mayor.
"You shouldn’t be getting that education if it’s not going to lead you to a better job. It’s an investment in yourself. So, I think it’s wrong,” he said.
At $18.01 per hour, the living wage in the county has increased since it was calculated in 2017 at $17.74.
A living wage is the hourly wage a worker requires to cover basic needs, promotes social inclusion, supports healthy child development principles, and ensures families are not under severe financial stress.
It’s different from minimum wage in that it is adjusted for the cost of living locally, it is reflective of the basic necessities of life, and it is calculated regularly to take into consideration cost of living increases and changes in government transfers and deductions.
The calculations were based on a family of four, with both parents working 35 hours per week, and one parent enrolled in part-time studies to improve their employment situation. Two children are included in this family, a seven-year-old attending before and after school care, and a three-year-old in full-day child care.
“The items that were mentioned by (Clarke) are outlined in a formula that is set by the Ontario Living Wage Network, who endorses and organizes this program,” said Greg Bishop, general manager of social and community services. “But, you’re absolutely right. People do work beyond 35 hours a week.”
The statistics were divided into six regions: Orillia, East Simcoe (Oro-Medonte, Ramara, Severn), North Simcoe (Midland, Penetanguishene, Tiny and Tay), South Simcoe, Barrie, and West Simcoe.
According to the staff report, the cost of living differs depending on where you live in the county.
The most expensive area to live in the county was East Simcoe, with annual family expenses calculated at $80,450. The least expensive was West Simcoe, at $68,225.
The family yearly expenses for 2018 in Orillia were $68,564. The Simcoe County average was $73,545.

Ontario Provincial Police say they have freed 43 modern-day slaves brought to Canada from Mexico by alleged human traffickers and forced to work as cleaners at hotels.
The 43, mostly men aged 20 to 46, were coached on what to say when they entered Canada, lived in "squalid" conditions in Barrie and Wasaga Beach, and were transported to hotel and vacation properties in Central and Eastern Ontario to work, police said on Monday.
All were freed last Tuesday following a joint investigation that involved the OPP, Barrie Police Service and Canada Border Services Agency.
"Human trafficking is modern-day slavery," OPP Deputy Commissioner Rick Barnum told reporters in Barrie. "Exploitation is the key element of this offence."
Police said the traffickers allegedly controlled the pay made by the workers. The victims had paid the traffickers large amounts of money to leave Mexico and were charged fees for transportation and lodgings.
The Mexicans worked at locations in Collingwood, Innisfil, Oro-Medonte and Cornwall, Ont., police said.
In some cases, police said the Mexicans, after paying various fees, were left with less than $50 a month.
Here is another example of the squalid conditions the workers faced. (Ontario Provincial Police)
'This morning, I woke up a free man'
One victim reportedly told investigators: "Last night, I went to bed a slave. This morning, I woke up a free man."
The alleged traffickers have not been arrested or charged.
A number of sources told police last year that a Barrie-based cleaning company, run by two people, was trafficking and defrauding the Mexican-born workers.
OPP Deputy Commissioner Rick Barnum says: 'Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. Exploitation is the key element of this offence.' (CBC)
The Mexicans had been brought to Canada "under the pretense" of being here for educational purposes or the promise of work visas and eventually permanent residency status.
Barnum added the workers are now here legally. Since they were rescued, they have been offered legal work and accommodations at a Barrie-area resort, Barrie police said.
Twelve search warrants were executed last Tuesday in Barrie and Wasaga Beach, six involving residences and six involving vehicles, police say. About 250 police officers were involved. Investigators are digging into the background of the "two people" who ran the cleaning company but they have not been charged.
Labour human trafficking 'very disturbing,' police say
Barrie Police Chief Kimberley Greenwood said the joint investigation involved what she called a "labour human trafficking" situation. She called it "very disturbing."
She said labour human trafficking involves the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of people for the purposes of exploitation for forced labour. It is not confined to large urban centres, she added.
Barrie Police Chief Kimberley Greenwood says: 'Whether it involves forced labour or the sex trade, the trafficking of humans is unacceptable. It has no place in our communities and will not be tolerated.' (CBC)
Victims are often members of vulnerable populations, including migrant workers and new immigrants. Victims rarely go to the authorities.
"It is inconceivable that this was taking place in our community," she said.
Greenwood said the 43 were in brought "under misleading circumstances," promised safer lives and more opportunities. "These individuals are now free from the control of the people who wished to exploit them for personal gain," she said.
After the victims were rescued, Greenwood said they went to a Barrie and Area Victim Services centre, where they were offered hot showers, food and clothing, and given medical assessments. Interpreters were made available, she said.
"I am pleased to announce that all of the victims have been offered employment and accommodations at a local resort," she said.
"Whether it involves forced labour or the sex trade, the trafficking of humans is unacceptable. It has no place in our communities and will not be tolerated."

The OPP declined to name the hotels and vacation properties where the men worked and the cleaning company in Barrie.
Criminal charges may be announced at a later date and police said they are looking for other suspects.

The regime of Nicolás Maduro once again lost part of the assets that Venezuela once had abroad; this time it is 20 tons of gold for not paying one of its debts overseas. Between non-payment, smuggling and theft of tons, the South American country is left without reserves.
The German bank, Deutsche Bank, seized 20 tons of Venezuelan gold owing to the non-payment of the debt that Maduro contracted with this institution in 2016.
Venezuela recibió en 2016 un préstamo de Deutsche Bank y dio 20 toneladas de oro en garantía. Por no pagar los intereses el Banco puede ejecutar la garantía ($ 750 millones). Guaidó pide al Banco depositar la diferencia ($ 120 millones) una cuenta fuera del alcance del régimen — Jose Toro Hardy (@josetorohardy) June 5, 2019
Venezuela received a cash loan from the German bank and used the gold as collateral. The contract is due in the year 2021. However, the Venezuelan government faltered on the interest payments, and the bank seized the guarantee. The critical unanswered question is how Maduro spent the loan money.
As 20 tons of gold has been seized, there is a difference in the value of 120 million dollars in favor of Venezuela. The legitimate Attorney General of Venezuela, José Ignacio Hernández, confirmed that they were in conversation with the bank to direct these funds to an account which is outside the reach of the regime.
It is important to remember that in 2017, the National Assembly which has an opposition majority sent an official letter to the board of Deutsche Bank to warn them that their transaction with Nicolás Maduro was illegal and ethically reprehensible; two years later the money has been effectively lost and so are the tons of gold.
Economist Henkel Garcia told PanAm Post that Venezuela has no means of generating confidence in external actors and faces grave difficulties in fulfilling its foreign currency commitments.
“It is difficult to know what happened to this money. A large part of it probably ended in the hands of those who hold positions of power. But we cannot know for sure,” Garcia explained.
“As Venezuela runs out of gold, it runs out of international reserves, the consequences of which are that imports would become even more complicated, and very few suppliers would want to conduct business with the country,” he said.
It is not the first time the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro has lost tons of gold due to the non-payment of foreign debts.
In October 2018, it was revealed that the Venezuelan dictator oversaw an exchange operation that left the same German Deutsche Bank with 45 tons of gold or a quarter of the total gold that Venezuela has abroad.
According to economist Daniel Lahoud, Venezuela has between 110 and 120 tons left, which is worth about 6500 million USD.
“They knew very well that this money was not going to be paid. Most likely, the gold that is left will be squandered in the same way. It’s unfortunate,” Lahoud told the PanAm Post.
Gold reserves disappear through illegal transactions
Venezuela has lost at least 764 tons of gold in the hands of the regimes of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro. The majority of the reserves disappeared through illegal transactions.
In April, economist and Member of Parliament, José Guerra, wrote on Twitter, “when Chávez ordered the repatriation of the gold in 2012, 850 tons were brought in. Today there are only 86 tons left. Those are the ones they are taking out.”
Besides the gold that international authorities have already confiscated due to unpaid debts, there is a large quantity of gold that the regime is illegally removing from the vaults of the Central Bank of Venezuela.
According to the economist, only 86 tons of gold is left in the vaults. The rest has been robbed, embezzled, traded, or exchanged for cash to sustain the dictatorship.
The Maduro regime has dedicated the last few months to loot the Central Bank of Venezuela, extracting tons of gold, and selling it abroad to obtain money to stay in power.
At the beginning of April, the dictatorship removed eight tons of gold worth 335 million USD. In February, it extracted a similar amount.
The gold ingots are sold “under the table” without approval from the legitimate National Assembly of Venezuela. It is one of the few different ways the dictatorship has to obtain cash, maintain its power, and pay a part of its internal and foreign debts.
In the absence of foreign currency, illegal mining persists
There is a shortage of oil production in Venezuela, coupled with growing sanctions. The Maduro regime has found a new way to finance itself by exporting gold illegally.
The US Treasury Department warned that Venezuela is resorting to gold trade without “environmental control and accountability” to finance its networks of corruption that sustain the dictatorship.
Assistant Treasury Secretary Marshall Billingslea condemned the plundering of gold mines in southern Venezuela and said it is “approaching a situation similar to that of blood diamonds” in Africa.
According to him, 21 metric tons of gold worth 840 million USD have left Venezuela in recent months. Most of the gold has been sent to Turkey.
In reality, it is impossible to calculate the quantity of gold in the Venezuelan Arch Mines. According to estimates, there is 8000 tons of gold worth 243 million euros. Additionally, there are reserves of coltan, bauxite, copper, and diamond in these mines.
The Times published a report revealing a series of mysteries flights out of Caracas inciting suspicions that Maduro is discretely extracting tons of gold from Venezuela and selling it to traders in Africa and the Middle East.
On 1st March, a Boeing 777 aircraft that belonged to the Russian airline Nordwind and supposedly had no passengers on board was tracked flying from Caracas to Kampala, the capital of Uganda. It stopped there for a few hours before continuing to Zanzibar and returned once again to the Venezuelan capital.
The same aircraft was seen at the end of January at the Maiquetía Simon Bolivar international airport that operates near the Venezuelan capital. It was apparently preparing to fly to the United Arab Emirates with a cargo of 20 tons of gold, valued at 650 million euros.

Equal Pay, Equal Pay…. Uguali compensi. Il coro scandito dagli spalti dello stadio Groupama di Lione ha segnato un momento raro su un campo da calcio. Domenica pomeriggio, 7 luglio, le ragazze degli Stati Uniti hanno appena battuto l’Olanda regalando al loro paese il quarto titolo mondiale di calcio. La cerimonia della vittoria è in corso, sul tappeto erboso c’è il presidente della FIFA Gianni Infantino oltre che il presidente della Repubblica francese, Emmanuel Macron. E il pubblico – soprattutto i tifosi americani arrivati in Francia – prorompe in un coro (testimoniato da questo tweet della giornalista Amée Ruszkai) che trasforma la celebrazione in una missione politica. Proprio quello che vogliono le calciatrici guidate dalla capitana Megan Rapinoe. Uguale compenso: le calciatrici vogliono avere quanto i colleghi uomini.
Megan Rapinoe lo dice subito ai microfoni del quotidiano francese sportivo L’Equipe. «Certo fa piacere sentire il pubblico che ripete il nostro slogan, è un discorso che tutti sono pronti a fare quello del pari compenso, siamo tutte stufe. Poi bisogna vedere cosa vuol dire passare ai fatti, come si sostiene la federazione femminile, cosa può fare la FIFA per aiutare». E parla a tutte le colleghe: «Le giocatrici di questo Mondiale hanno tutte fatto vedere cose incredibili, non si può giocare meglio». E Infantino, che era lì? «Sul podio abbiamo scherzato, abbiamo sorriso, mi ha guardato. Dovremo fare un discorso serio».
Un discorso serio. Tutti gli Stati Uniti celebrano: a New York l’Empire State Building si illumina in onore di @USWNT: “brilliamo stanotte con orgoglio di rosso bianco e blu per la loro vittoria”. La campionessa di tennis Billie Jean King twitta: “Queste atlete hanno portato più attenzione, sostegno e orgoglio allo sport femminile forse di ogni altro team nella storia. L’ora di pagarle quanto meritano è passata da un pezzo”.
Cifre. Il Mondiale femminile quest’anno aveva 30 milioni di dollari da distribuire alle giocatrici, scrive il New York Times. Il Mondiale maschile del 2018 ha distribuito 400 milioni di dollari. Gianni Infantino ha già detto che vorrebbe raddoppiare i premi e il sostegno finanziario alle squadre femminili, ampliando la partecipazione da 24 a 32 squadre. Ma anche così il divario resta opprimente.
In Italia, abbiamo visto nelle scorse settimane quanto il successo delle #ragazzemondiali abbia irritato gli uomini che si sentono detentori della sacralità del pallone: battute sessiste, accuse di scarsa tecnica e gioco ‘da oratorio’, e a monte l’insulto: siete femmine, non potete giocare bene (la stessa accusa che le ragazzine si sentono ribadire dall’alba dell’umanità, suppongo; certamente ce lo siamo sentite dire tutte). Ancora prima: siccome non potete giocare alla pari con gli uomini, è giusto che siate pagate meno.
Quanto meno?
Lo spettacolo splendido offerto dalle calciatrici di questo Mondiale – ce ne siamo finalmente accorti anche in Italia grazie al successo delle ragazze che le ha portate in diretta su RaiUno, era ora – dovrebbe bastare a tacitare queste accuse (non basterà invece). Ma naturalmente il successo (e la bravura e la tecnica) non nascono dal nulla. Questo articolo del Guardian ripercorre le disposizioni legislative che negli Usa hanno creato un pool di giocatrici di talento: norme che hanno incoraggiato lo sport nelle scuole e nelle università, che con l’Education Amendments Act del 1972 hanno impedito la discriminazione a sfavore delle ragazze nell’istruzione di ogni ordine e grado, in tutti i settori… incluso lo sport. Questo significò anche la creazione di borse di studio universitarie sportive di uguale consistenza per ragazzi e ragazze. Nel 1972 negli Usa c’erano solo 700 ragazze che giocavano a calcio nei licei. Nel 2018 ce ne erano 390.482.
Il modello americano, con l’enorme peso che riveste lo sport – baseball football basket lacrosse soccer e altro – nelle scuole, è molto lontano dall’Italia. Ma forse qualcosa si può imparare. Intanto la squadra statunitense trionfa e l’ex campionessa Usa Abby Wambach gongola: “Oggi questa squadra ha mostrato all’America quello che è possibile – no – quello che è INEVITABILE: le donne ci guideranno. E vinceranno. E non staremo più zitte sulle diseguaglianze”.
Le compagne sono tutte con Rapinoe. Come ricorda questo articolo di Time Magazine sono state criticate, naturalmente, perché “celebrano con troppa esultanza; sono arroganti; prima della finale, Alex Morgan ha rifiutato di scusarsi perché dopo aver segnato contro l’Inghilterra in semifinale ha mimato il gesto di bere un sorso di tè“. Lei ha replicato: “Gli uomini celebrano come vogliono, anche afferrandosi le palle”.
Nel mio cuore resta Sandro Pertini che esultava a Madrid per la vittoria dell’Italia ’82. Ma sapete chi non c’era a Lione? Donald Trump. Impegnato da molte settimane in una schermaglia via Twitter con Megan Rapinoe: la capitana ha dichiarato e ribadito che non intende andare alla Casa Bianca se la squadra sarà invitata.

Rapinoe ha già guidato il team alla vittoria dei Mondiali 2015, alla finale nei Mondiali 2011, alla medaglia d’oro nelle Olimpiadi 2012 a Londra. La centrocampista bionda – i suoi capelli corti sono sfumati di lilla in questo campionato, è proprio il prodotto dell’educazione sportiva a tutti i livelli negli Usa. E’ una professionista di livello internazionale, sponsorizzata da Nike e Samsung. Ha giocato nei Chicago Red Stars, nel Philadelphia Independence e anche in Francia nell’Olympique Lyonnais. Era il 2012 quando annunciò di essere lesbica. Da allora si è impegnata in campagne per numerose organizzazioni LGBT. Dal 2013 è ambasciatrice per Athlete Ally, una noprofit che lotta contro l’omofobia e la transfobia nello sport.
«Megan ha detto che non sarebbe andata alla Casa Bianca. Siamo tutte con lei», ha detto Allie Long.
Trump, dopo i quarti di finale, aveva twittato con arroganza: , Sono un grande fan della Squadra Americana e del Calcio Femminile ma Megan dovrebbe prima VINCERE e poi PARLARE! Finisci l’opera! Non abbiamo ancora invitato Megan o la squadra, ma adesso invito la squadra che vinca o che perda. Megan non dovrebbe mancare di rispetto alla Patria, alla Casa Bianca o alla Bandiera, soprattutto perché è stato fatto moltissimo per lei e la squadra. Sii orgogliosa della Bandiera che indossi. Gli USA vanno alla GRANDE!
E dopo la vittoria? Indovinate un po’: Donald Trump ha passato la notte italiana a twittare di come i giornalisti lo maltrattino, ma per le ragazze mondiali ha trovato solo una frase di circostanza: Congratulazioni alla US Women’s Soccer Team per la loro vittoria mondiale! Gioco grande ed eccitante. L’America è orgogliosa di tutte voi!
Celebravano con esultanza, le ragazze sul prato di Lione, potete vederla scorrendo i tweet dell’account US Soccer WNT Tobin Heath baciando la coppa, Alex Morgan, Kelley O’Hara e Allie Long saltando, Christen Press avvolta nella bandiera a stelle e strisce come una cappa da super eroina. E lei, Megan, con un enorme sorriso dietro di loro; e tutte poi a terra fra l’oro e azzurro dei coriandoli. Una vittoria sul campo, una vittoria politica, una vittoria per tutte.

British Airways pilots may be balloted over strike action in a dispute over pay.
Pilots' union Balpa has recently rejected two separate new pay deals on behalf of its members who work for the British flag carrier.
Now the union has written to BA CEO Alex Cruz to warn him that it may put industrial action to the vote unless a breakthrough can be made.
British Airways pilots may be balloted over strike action in a dispute over pay
The first pay offer was a one-year deal, which included a 0.5 per cent 'one-off' payment.
But Balpa claims that this amounts to less than a single day's overtime payment for most of its members.
A second option was a two-year deal of a 2.5 per cent increase this year and one tied at RPI (Retail Price Index) in 2020, but capped at 2.3 per cent.
RPI was confirmed as being 2.5 per cent in January and February 2019.
But Balpa argues that RPI is forecast to rise above this level in late 2019. In a newsletter to members it said that it would rise to 2.7 per cent. At the time of writing it's actually forecast to be 2.9 per cent.
Balpa argues, therefore, that the offer is below inflation for both years and amounts to a 'real terms pay cut'.
Indeed, RPI for 2020 is forecast to be 2.5 per cent, slightly above the cap.
Balpa has written to BA CEO Alex Cruz, pictured, to warn him that it may put industrial action to the vote unless a breakthrough can be made
In the newsletter Balpa says that the airline is not listening to the concerns its employees have over pay.
It said: 'Our senior management has a choice – to deny change is necessary and continue to use the same old tactics that fostered the current disengagement and disconnect, or to start to listen and address deficiencies in corporate strategy.
'The pay and bonus offer to staff is in stark contrast to the large double-digit bonuses that many managers in IAG and BA received in 2018/19 pay.
'Perhaps it is only necessary to motivate managers by rewarding them properly with a share in BA's success?
'We ask BA to engage with us and listen to our concerns by showing progressive leadership, vision and a true one-team approach. We believe we are not alone in our views and that many within BA management would welcome cultural change too.'
In the letter to BA CEO Mr Cruz, Balpa writes that the responses from BA over the pay dispute have been 'unacceptable' and that a possible strike ballot would be regrettable.
It explains: 'It is with regret that pilot representatives are now forced to take steps to prepare for a possible ballot for industrial action over the current pay negotiation.
'If future revenue is damaged, or our customers' concerns about operational stability grow, responsibility for this must fall at the feet of British Airways and IAG senior management, who are seemingly unwilling to listen to employees.'
The letter urges the airline to invest in its staff if it wants to continue being successful.
It adds: 'Continued success for BA will require investment in staff to go beyond social media, a new uniform and a lapel pin.
A letter from Balpa to British Airways urges the airline to invest in its staff if it wants to continue being successful
'Our position reflects that aspiration. Investment in new aircraft and innovative Club or First cabins represent little value if the frontline staff including pilots who deliver that product to our customers are not aligned with the company path.
'We believe that other stakeholders, including all cabin crew would not disagree with this sentiment.
'As employees, we utterly reject any notion that management goals and our goals are mutually exclusive. BA pilots accepted cuts to assist our company during the global financial crisis and adapted conditions to allow BA to grow.
'When times were bad, we worked well together; however, now that times are good BA is failing to provide awards that share in the success of the company.
'This strategy cannot be justified going forward. It is time the company acknowledged this. We are seeking these changes because the status quo is no longer acceptable to our members.'
Balpa said that the ballot for strike action will take place in the next two to three weeks if no progress is made.
A spokesman for British Airways said: 'Our pay proposal is fair, reasonable and reflects typical pay awards given by other companies in the UK.
'We continue open discussions with our trade unions.'

Rafi Anteby makes jewelry out of old bullets. Some are encrusted with diamonds and other precious gems, while some are in their natural form. His Bullets 4 Peace pieces have ended up on the necks of celebrities like Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Jamie Foxx. While his jewelry found its way to these illustrious names via different channels, he estimates that he’s participated in about 50 Hollywood “gifting suites” and given away “way, way, over” $100,000 worth of blingy bullets to celebrities at all levels of fame.
As such, Anteby now fancies himself a pro in this very specific type of celebrity marketing offering free merchandise. He started his own gifting suite company that debuted during Oscars weekend in 2018, and he’s since organized five others that ran adjacent to awards ceremonies. This year, the “Rafi Gift Lounge” will be held at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills the Friday before the 2019 Oscars ceremony. It joins what he estimates will be at least 10 other gifting suites vying to attract celebrities that weekend.
There are detractors who are skeptical about this concept. One is Robin Tolkan-Doyle, the founder of Charmed PR, an LA-based agency that represents mostly indie beauty brands. In 2015, she wrote on an industry site that she discourages her clients from taking part in these suites. She still stands by this.
“You’ll start to see the same names over and over again. It kind of makes [celebrities] look a little petty. They get so much stuff. They have rooms piled up.”
What exactly is a gifting suite?
The Hollywood gifting suite is the thirstier relative of the awards show gift bag. The latter, a bag full of free swag valued in the five-figure range and up, is a time-honored tradition during awards season and at film festivals like Sundance. Basically, celebrities are given a big bag of stuff in the hopes that they will like it and talk about it.
With a gift bag, the whole thing is rather passive; it’s handed or delivered to celebrities. But in a gifting suite or lounge, a celebrity usually needs to make a conscious choice to show up and take the free items. It is understood that they will take pictures with the items they’re being gifted and/or with the founders of the brands. Sometimes they are at the same venue as other events, but often they’re on different days at off-site locations.
Like the gift bags (as Vox explained in its 2017 story on the tradition), most gift suites are not associated with the awards shows that bring all those potentially lucrative celebrities into town at the same time, though there are exceptions that are officially sanctioned. Anteby ran the 2018 BET Awards official gifting suite, but he is careful to say that his Oscars weekend lounge has nothing to do with the Oscars or its organizing body, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which does not sponsor any gifting suites.
Karen Wood, the founder of Backstage Creations, takes credit for the gift lounge concept, launching backstage gifting suites and experiences at awards shows and galas in 1994. Backstage Creations calls them, somewhat euphemistically, “retreats.” There are a number of other established companies that stage them now, too, like GBK Productions, which also organizes weddings and assists in companies’ marketing and public relations efforts. In a recent podcast, founder Gavin Keilly said, “There are a lot of bad lounges out there,” noting that some really don’t give away much of value.
How much do gifting suites cost, and who goes to these?
Like with all things in Hollywood, there are tiers of lounges. While not explicit, the relative desirability of the lounge can be understood through some combination of the brands on offer, the price of the “gifts,” and the celebrities that attend. Anteby is inviting about 200 notables, which include celebrities, social media influencers, and about 20 press outlets, like Extra TV.
A month prior to the suite (which is apparently too soon to finalize everyone’s attendance), he has confirmation that an actor from A Star Is Born — Andrew Dice Clay, not, alas, Lady Gaga or Bradley Cooper — will attend, as well as some of “the cast of Westworld.” Though at the time he didn’t yet know who, a recent Instagram post suggests that includes Leonardo Nam.
Anteby also has confirmed singer Estelle and actors Gerard Butler, Steven Bauer, and Michael Irby. His team is talking to, but has no commitment yet from, social media influencer Andrew Bachelor, aka @KingBach, who has 17.5 million followers and was once the most followed person on Vine. He has since taken on more traditional acting roles. Chris Noth, a.k.a. Mr. Big, frequently swings by Anteby’s events as well.
All of them can take home items from the approximately 25 vendors that will pay $10,000 to $50,000 for the privilege of being there, not counting the cost of the items they give away for free, according to Anteby.
In the podcast, GBK’s Keilly says the fee is usually $5,000 to $7,500, though event sponsors, who get their name on the step-and-repeat and otherwise prominently displayed, can pay up to $50,000. Anteby says some companies will allow brands to participate in multiple gifting suites throughout the year, but says this is not ideal, at least in his experience as a brand owner, because then celebrities see the same brands over and over, diluting the value of the experience.
Anteby estimates that the worth of all the freebies in his suites are usually between $25,000 and $45,000. Some of the 25 vendors that are participating in his Oscars lounge include resorts giving away trips to Bali, Uganda on safari, and Costa Rica. The most expensive is one of the trips for two, which rings in at $14,000. There are also services like interior design, personal chefs, a doctor who does facials with stem cells, and spas. Then there are more traditional items like liquor (Cava de Oro), energy shots (JumpStart), clothing brands (none you’ve likely heard of), and supplement/vitamin brands (Source Naturals).
“Some brands, even though they want to be involved, can’t because if it’s something that [attendees] can find in 7-Eleven, I’m not going to bring it to them, no matter how much they pay me. It has to be special,” Anteby says. (Perhaps he was throwing shade at GBK, which once had Tic Tac giving away its candies alongside a charitable donation at a gifting event.)
Anteby says he pays between $60,000 and $100,000 to put on his events. He claims there is some smoke and mirrors involved in the process. Often the location of the suite isn’t announced until shortly beforehand — he says suites claim that this is because “they don’t want anyone to know where they’re at.” But in fact “they’re trying to save money and see which hotels didn’t book anything. ... It’s cheaper for them. I take the most expensive hotel that everybody’s going to flock into because everybody’s already there, then I spend on sushi and I spend on organic food. This event is costing $60,000 before I even started. It’s expensive.”
In addition to the room and food, he says he is also donating $100 per each attendee to purchase school supplies for a group of orphans in Myanmar. The money isn’t disbursed through a specific, sanctioned charity, but he goes to the country yearly to teach kung fu classes. Tacking on a charitable component presumably might help assuage some guilt for the swag-seeking attendees.
There will also be entertainment, including the gospel duo Mary Mary; a one-time Temptations lead singer, Louis Price; and a one-time Platters lead singer, Sonny Turner.
“Most probably I won’t make money. And you know what? It’s okay. I’m happy. Of course it’s a business formula, and I believe it’s going to grow more and more,” Anteby says. “If I break even and I throw a good event and I help a cause, I’m good.”
Again, why are rich celebs being given free expensive stuff?
As lore has it, Paris Hilton once walked out of a Sundance gifting suite in 2009 with 30 bags of stuff.
“People think they are freeloaders, but they’re not. They come, and they really have fun and relax,” Anteby says.
He is adamant about this next point. “It’s not free. Their name and the likeness and their look is what they pay with. It’s a fair exchange between brands and artists, that’s how I see it. It’s almost like beautiful bartering. I’m the living proof. One hundred percent, without celebrities my brand would go nowhere.”
The pictures the brands get to take with the celebrities are crucial at gifting suites. Companies can share them on social media, and reporters who attend circulate these moments.
“To get a celeb wearing your product, it’s good but it’s not enough if it doesn’t propagate through the social media systems,” Anteby says. “It’s like having a Ferrari in the showroom and nobody comes to see it.”
Publicist Tolkan-Doyle does not believe it’s ultimately worth it. “[Gifting suites] are very expensive, they don’t guarantee anything, and when you look at the celebrities that they’re actually talking about, they’re not the people you necessarily want to be representing your brand,” she says, noting that they’re “not A-list.”
“I don’t want to bash these companies,” she adds, “but I’m pretty protective of the brands I work with, and I don’t ever advise my clients to go and spend reckless amounts of money on these things.”
But Anteby has high aspirations, saying he wants his suites to be “just like [how] Clive Davis or Elton John have their events once a year during the Oscars — I want to be the one that everyone knows, that everyone comes to. It’s a party!”

Compostela Valley Governor Jayvee Tyron Uy (PNA file photo)
PANTUKAN, Compostela Valley -- The provincial government here is optimistic about the approval on the renaming of this province to Davao de Oro, saying this would cater to development since it would mean that it is closer to Davao City.
Governor Jayvee Tyron Uy, in an interview on Saturday, said the move would pave the way for the creation of more economic zones in the province.
Apart from that, the governor added that the province is rich in natural resources and has a stable economic status, which could entice more investors.
Uy disclosed that based on the Commission on Elections (Comelec) Resolution 10600, the plebiscite on the ratification of the law renaming the province as Davao de Oro has been set on December 7.
It was set from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m., wherein counting and canvassing of votes will immediately follow.
He added that a total of PHP54 million was allotted for the conduct of the plebiscite on the said date.
"Comelec has numerous lined up activities in the memorandum. They will also spearhead the information dissemination campaign," he stressed.
Representatives Maria Carmen "Maricar" Zamora, Ruwel Peter Gonzaga and Pedro Acharon Jr. filed House Bill 7363, which sought to rename the province into Davao de Oro, on May 15, 2018.
Senators Juan Miguel Zubiri and Sonny Angara filed the Senate Bill 1746 last December 10, 2018.
The bills were consolidated on January 29 and RA 11297 (An Act Renaming the Province of Compostela Valley as the Province of Davao de Oro) was then signed into law on April 17, but was made public only on May 22. (PNA)

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY - A former village chief of Pagatpat in Cagayan de Oro City has been found guilty of raping a minor.
Achilles Jude Babaran was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt for two counts of raping the victim and was sentenced to reclusion perpetua, according to the decision penned by Judge Jose Escobido of Regional Trial Court Branch 37 on October 30.
Aside a prison term, Babaran was also ordered to pay P75,000 in moral damages, P75,000 in civil indemnity, and another P75,000 for exemplary damages.
His lawyer said they will file a motion for reconsideration.
In 2015, Babaran was accused of raping a 16-year-old girl. The girl was later found dead inside a hotel in Cagayan de Oro the following year.
Babaran was also considered as person of interest in the death of the minor, but was not charged because of lack of evidence.
Babaran's camp said it paid P250,000 to the complainant's mother as a settlement but the court did not put much ground into it.

April 2 is Equal Pay Day.
According to the National Committee on Pay Equity, the day symbolizes how far into the year women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year. But for Black women that day’s not until August 22, for Latina’s, November 20.
In New York State, women earn 88 cents to the dollar of a man’s salary.
A report by the Institute of Women’s Policy Research says the pay gap for the average woman won’t close until 2059.
For college students across the nation about to enter the workforce, the gender gap won’t close until they’re ready to retire.

Italian restaurant Lâoca dâoro, a local electrician, and the Workers Defense Project have joined the city in its legal defense of the cityâs paid sick leave ordinance. The troupeâs attorneys at the Texas Civil Rights Project intervened in the lawsuit against the measure and filed a separate motion to scrap the suit altogether. (Both are available online here.) In April, groups including the Texas Association of Business claimed the ordinance, set to take effect Oct. 1, violates the Texas Minimum Wage Act by requiring that business owners provide employees up to eight paid sick days (or 64 hours) annually. The new defendants argue that the minimum wage law only applies to the amount of wages that can be mandated in Texas, not sick leave policies or âany other employment benefits whatsoever.â
âAs an electrician, I am a small part of the hundreds of thousands of workers who are building this city,â said Joe Hernandez, the electrician, during a press conference last week. âYet, nearly a quarter of a million of us still live with the fear of losing a whole day of pay if we fall sick or need to care for a family member.â Lâoca dâoro co-owner Adam Orman said his restaurant instituted a paid sick leave policy nine months ago: âItâs important to us to be a part of this litigation to make sure that our work, City Councilâs work, and the work of the multitude of other small businesses that were instrumental in crafting the ordinance does not get overturned by a coalition of businesses that want to provide as few rights as possible and as low wages as possible to their employees.â
The Workers Defense Project notes how special interests are backing the effort to sideline the ordinance. For instance, named plaintiffs the National Federation of Independent Business is a lobbying group largely funded by Freedom Partners, a conservative nonprofit subsidized by the Koch Brothers and made up of a board with either present or former Koch Industries employees. While the NFIB claims to back small businesses, theyâve historically lobbied for policies that benefit the wealthy.

Omnia Holdings’ share price shot up more than 20 percent on the JSE to trade at R60.20 on Tuesday after it said it intended to restructure debt. Photo: Leon Nicholas/African News Agency (ANA)
CAPE TOWN – Chemicals group Omnia Holdings’ share price shot up more than 20 percent to trade at R60.20 yesterday after it said it intended to restructure debt. The share closed at R58.14. A trading statement released in March caught the market by surprise when Omnia directors said a headline loss of R134 million was expected for the year to end-March 2019, from headline earnings of R670m the year before, partly because of higher finance charges to fund debt that was raised to pay for acquisitions and new plant. To provide an indication of how far the share price has fallen, a year ago it was trading at around R147.80.
However, the directors said yesterday that they were in talks with Omnia’s major debt providers and an appropriate debt structure was being assessed. Another trading statement would be released once there was reasonably certainty what impact the debt restructuring might have on the full year and comparative results. The results are expected to be published on or about June 25.
Last year the group acquired international bio-pesticide, nutrients and soil conditioner manufacturer Oro Agri for $100m. In addition, R695m was spent to construct a new nitro-phosphate plant. At the end of September 2018, Omnia’s interest bearing borrowings had shot up to R2.5 billion from R1.07bn at the end of March that year, and only R147m in the comparable interim period the year before.
According to the March statement, a number of once-off costs were also expected to contribute to the weak results including: a R44m impairment of a problematic debtor in Angola; Protea Chemicals spent R35m to restructure its business; while The Emerging Farmers programme, in a year of drought, continued to be under stress.

Many Netflix users end up sharing their passwords with friends and family, a problem the streaming platform faces globally.

There are two kinds of Netflix viewers - the ones who pay for their account and the ones who are friends with those who pay.For those in the second category, streaming platforms could soon be able to track down multiple users sharing the same account.At the(CES) 2019 being held in Las Vegas, a UK-based startup, Synamedia, offered its Artificial Intelligence-led solution to service providers to take a sneak peek into their user analytics.With this tool , online streaming sites will be able to get data on devices using the platform and the duration for which the person was logged in. The aggregated data, including the content consumed, can be shared with the service providers.Right after CES, Europe’s leading media and entertainment company Sky invested in the startup, which already boasts of high-profile clients like Tata Sky, Comcast and Disney among others.Globally, Netflix added seven million subscribers in Q3 of 2018 along with reported earnings of 89 cents per share on revenue of $4 billion. In India too, Netflix has been adding more and more users, with the country becoming the third-largest market for the global company.However, the problem of 'shared users' is a global problem for online platforms.Netflix under its different plans allows a maximum of six users to use one account, Amazon Prime allows a maximum of three users, while foronly one user can use an account at a particular time.A survey done by Pixights Consulting, which covered 1,800 people from across India, showed that over 70% respondents share their accounts of Netflix, Hotstar and Amazon Prime with others.Netflix, whose pricing plans start at 500 and above, is still considered a premium service in India. Rivals like Amazon Prime costs ₹129 for a month while Hotstar charges ₹199 for a month.Synamedia’s AI tool may just what these companies need to plug the profit leaks. But for users, the solution could soon spell trouble, until of course another trick comes their way.

ASX-listed Oro Verde will acquire up to a 60% stake in the Makuutu rare earths project, in Uganda.
The project is owned by Rwenzori Rare Metals (RRM), which is, in turn, 85%-owned by South Africa’s Rare Earth Elements Africa.

Oro Verde has entered into a binding option agreement with both companies to enable it to acquire up to a 60% direct interest in RRM and, thereby, up to a 60% indirect interest in the project.
The agreement calls for the payment of $10 000 for a 30-day exclusive option period; and upon exercise of the option, the payment of $100 000 in cash, as well as the issue of $150 000 worth of Oro shares at a 30-day volume weighted average price, in return for an immediate 20% interest in RRM.

Oro will contribute a further $1.7-million in expenditure for the project by October 1, 2020, to earn up to a 51% interest in RRM. The company must also fund to completion a bankable feasibility study to earn an additional 9% interest for a cumulative 60% interest in RRM.
The Makuutu project comprises three licences covering about 132 km2, located about 40 km east of Jinja and 120 km east of Kampala.
“We have searched extensively and very selectively for the company’s next project and are very excited by this new acquisition. Makuutu has the potential to be a substantive and significant project with a favourable rare earth element mix, that is located strategically outside of China in a mining-friendly jurisdiction,” Oro director Dr Marc Steffens said on Friday.
The Makuutu project geology is similar to that of the southern China ionic clay-type deposits, which are the cheapest and most readily accessible source of heavy rare earth oxides that are extracted through rudimentary mining and processing methods.
Preliminary metallurgical work has been undertaken on Makuutu mineralisation that culminated in an 8.5 t bulk sample being tested at Mintek’s laboratories in South Africa, which has confirmed favourable metallurgy and extraction characteristics typical of ionic clay mineralisation.
Oro will use the 30-day due diligence period to verify the previous exploration and testing results generated by the current owners, including ground gravity and radiometric surveys, pitting for metallurgical testwork samples, more than 100 drill holes totalilng more than 2 000 m of drilling and sample assays, preliminary metallurgical testing, geological modelling, and a non-Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant mineral resource estimate.

Arizona State University will pay nearly $5 million annually to rent and operate a new site in a historic building in downtown Los Angeles.
The university will lease about 86,000 square feet in the historic Herald Examiner building. When ASU announced its plans to open a space in Los Angeles, the university would not provide details on cost.
The first year of rent is below market rate, Arizona Board of Regents documents say, and the landlord is required to renovate and upgrade the building until there's a "usable core and shell."
ASU's Enterprise Partners, a private offshoot of the university, is "contributing to this renovation," board documents say.
The university will get six months of free rent and an allowance to make improvements.

The first full year of "unabated" rent will be more than $3.3 million, board documents say. And the annual cost to operate the building in the first year is $1.5 million.
The lease term is 12 years and can be renewed up to 34.5 years.
But Enterprise Partners entered into a lease with the building's landlord to "preserve ASU's ability to lease space." ASU received approval from the regents Friday to take over the lease from Enterprise Partners.
The big idea behind LA

The Los Angeles building provides ASU a more tangible way to pick off students from California universities.
Nearly 14,000 students from California were enrolled at ASU last fall, board documents show. About 2,700 are from the Los Angeles area, both in online and in-person classes.
But ASU sees Los Angeles as a huge untapped market.
More than 36,000 people between the ages of 18 and 25 live within seven miles of downtown Los Angeles, board documents say.
Beyond enrollment, the university thinks its LA site can boost its reputation.
"Given that Los Angeles is one of the country’s most globally recognized cities, ASU’s greater presence there, much like its presence in Washington, D.C., will allow for reputational advancement that will help build enrollment and financial strength," board documents say.
Program details
ASU plans to move into the building, which has been largely vacant for decades, in 2020. ASU has housed some programs, like journalism and film, at its California Center in Santa Monica since 2013.
ASU plans to bring in programs and initiatives to “draw on the interests and intellectual resources of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, the Herberger Institute of Design and the Arts, and other units of the university.”
The historic 1914 building, commissioned by publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, was designed by Julia Morgan, the architect who also designed the California landmark Hearst Castle.
The building, in a Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial style, features high ceilings, ornate details like marble and gold and hand-painted tiles. The renovated structure will draw on the building’s roots while modernizing interiors, ASU said last year.
The developers plan to completely renovate the building and add restaurants and retail on the ground floor. Classrooms and offices will occupy higher floors.

Herc Gomez puts Dax McCarty on the spot making him choose between Carlos Vela and Zlatan Ibrahimovic if he were building a team right now. (1:14)
There appears to be different sides to Carlos Vela.
There's the one that lives in Los Angeles, talks to the press, contributes a goal per game for LAFC and is honing in on the MLS MVP award. That's the happy Vela, the one fans pay to see, produces the kind of special moments in games only elite players are capable of and attracts interest from Barcelona, even at 30.
Then there's the Vela with Mexico. On national team duty, Vela is shy, avoids the cameras, very rarely talks to journalists and generally looks uneasy, even if he does try to mask it with that wide smile. He's had his moments in a Mexico shirt, but not the highs that his talent demands. Arguably the highlight was the 2005 Under-17 World Cup victory.
And now, just like in 2014 ahead of the World Cup, Vela has hit peak form ahead of a summer tournament, only to express his desire not to lead El Tri's attack.
"I spoke with Carlos Vela over the phone last week and he assured me that at this time his club and his family are his priority, that's why he stepped aside," said Mexico coach Gerardo "Tata" Martino in a news conference on Tuesday in Mexico City.
It may well be a coincidence that Vela's best form has come when he hasn't been participating with the national team, but it still goads Mexico fans like a sick joke. Why? Because Vela is still arguably the best Mexican player out there, even if he is now in MLS and not in La Liga with Real Sociedad.
- When is the CONCACAF Gold Cup?
- Full CONCACAF Gold Cup fixtures schedule
It's now difficult to see Vela coming back under Martino, posing the question of whether the Cancun native's national team career is over.
That remains to be seen, but the issues facing the Argentine go beyond the LAFC forward and his decision not to represent his country.

Back in March, Hector Herrera and Javier Hernandez appeared to be on track to be included this summer, but neither has been included in the preliminary Gold Cup list.
Herrera publicly asked to be excluded because of the long season he's had at Porto and his pending move to Atletico Madrid, while West Ham striker Hernandez is due to become a father. Martino stated previously that he didn't want to include players that would be distracted.
And there's the Jesus "Tecatito" Corona debacle, with Martino deciding against calling a player who hadn't shown up for the March friendlies.
As individual cases, the players' decisions -- Corona's back in March and the other three ahead of the summer -- are rational and understandable. But as a group, it points to a concerning trend and something Martino is clearly not happy about as he seeks to establish a fresh culture.
"I don't think it is common. It's not something I've seen before," said Martino. "A call-up to the national team is a reward for footballers and when they don't see it as that, it's logical for them not to be here."
Add to that the absence of Diego Lainez and the fact Hirving Lozano is not guaranteed to return to full fitness ahead of the Gold Cup and this Mexico squad has been shorn of its best midfielder (Herrera) and a heap of its best attacking talent.
Even without them, there's enough quality in the squad to bring the Gold Cup back to Mexico. It's not time to panic; young names like midfielders Carlos Rodriguez (Monterrey) and Ivan Rodriguez (Leon), as well as Uriel Antuna (LA Galaxy), Jorge Sanchez (America) and Alexis Vega (Chivas) can seize the opportunity.
Perhaps the generational change that Martino knew he'd be in charge of has just been given an enforced and premature kick-start.
But behind the scenes, it has been a little bit of a struggle for the Argentine in his first five months in charge.
The former Paraguay coach's hiring late last year was engineered by Dennis te Kloese and Guillermo Cantu, along with Gerardo Torrado, and then rubber-stamped by FMF president Yon de Luisa.
Te Kloese left for the Galaxy's GM position earlier this year, while it was announced earlier this month that Cantu will be vacating his post as sporting director of the FMF after the Gold Cup.
"They've left me alone, only [Torrado] is left," said Martino in an interview with ESPN earlier this month. "In reality, when this type of thing happens such a short time after having spoken to them and having come in here, it is a strange feeling."
Martino also seemed to confirm that Mexico won't be in the 2020 Copa America, which is a bitter blow that could leave El Tri without a truly competitive international tournament until the next World Cup.
"Being in the Copa America was a possibility this year or next year, until the [FMF] president told us that there isn't any chance of participating in the Copa America," said Martino.
These aren't make-or-break issues on their own -- and Martino re-enforced his commitment to his project with Mexico -- but the niggling problems off the field aren't pleasant, even if there were positive performances and results in his first two games.
The Argentine will now be desperate for the players that do want to participate to arrive in camp, start training and for the games to finally get underway.

TAGUM CITY (MindaNews / 10 May) – A local marketing giant and a private hospital here have distanced themselves from companies aggressively luring investors with a promise of bigger earnings and warned that they do not own or manage any of the money trading businesses operating in this city.
The LYR Group of Companies – which has businesses in appliances, motorcycles, furniture, gasoline, printing, among others – issued a statement Thursday, saying that the firm “does not own or manage any market trading investment business or any type related to this kind of business.”
This comes after it received a deluge of inquiries from would-be investors if the LYR Group is engaged in money trading.
“A lot of inquiries has been asked towards us and many names pop out. The most common is ‘P7 Marketing’ and some other names. We are warning you! These are scams!!! The moment these companies use the name of the LYR Group of Companies, consider them as scammers,” the company warned.
LYR has several branches operating in the cities of Tagum, Davao, Digos, Cagayan de Oro and elsewhere in Southern Mindanao.
The business firm also appealed to the owner of P7 Marketing to settle the issue with them the soonest possible time.
P7 Marketing is a company involved in foreign exchange trading that lures investors with a promise of big earnings.
“We are now calling the attention of the owner or people behind this company to contact us in any means possible to resolve this squabble. We are not against other businesses. But we are definitely against name-grabbing and name-using. This needs to stop,” LYR Group stressed.
P7 Marketing apparently has a Facebook page under the name Perfect Save’n Marketing followed by 1,892 people as of Friday evening. Its office, said one of its post, “is located at corner Osmeña St. and National Highway second floor above American Surplus fronting Emcor” in Tagum City.
Its earliest posts were dawn of April 25 as it updated its profile and cover pictures.
Shortly after, it posted a promo dubbed “X6 your money with a twist.”
It cited as an example that if one invests P50,000 in P7, he will receive 300% of his money, or P150,000, in “more or less 30 days.” The other 300% will be reinvested in P7 with a lock-in period of six months.
“The company will pay you an interest of 30% monthly for your remaining investment,” P7 said.
“P45,000 monthly up to five months then when your contract ends in six months the company will give you the remaining 300% (P150,000),” P7 claimed. “Within six months you gain P525,000,” it added.
MindaNews was able to talk to an agent of P7 Marketing but requested not to be identified.
A public school teacher, the agent said that P7 Marketing is one of the investment companies in Tagum City that offers easy cash to would-be investors.
He insists the company is affiliated with LYR Marketing even though the latter denied ties with P7 Marketing.
The agent said P7 was launched in Tagum last May 7 at Penny Lane Hotel and Casino.
To entice investors, P7 Marketing assures their investors that their money will be earning a huge interest for a month since the company is engaged in money trading, the agent said.
Meanwhile, the Aquino Medical Specialists Hospital Inc. (AMSHI) also issued similar warning, noting that the hospital has not been part of these investment companies mushrooming in Tagum.
“The board and management of the Aquino Medical Specialists Hospital Inc. (AMSHI) hereby inform its stakeholders and the general public that we are in no way connected to, an affiliate with or a member of any company or corporation in Tagum City and elsewhere engaged in pay-in and pay-out investment schemes,” the hospital wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday afternoon.
The hospital, however, did not specifically identify the investment company where it is rumored to be associated with. (Mart Sambalud / MindaNews)

HAVANA TIMES – Descendants of former Cuban businessman Rafael Lucas Sanchez Hill have filed a lawsuit in Spain against the Melia hotel chain, reported dpa news.
The Sanchez Hills, who live in the United States, are seeking 10 million dollars as indemnification for Cuba lands seized by the government in 1960, after Fidel Castro seized control of the island.
The land is now the site of some hotels built by the Cuban armed forces and run by the Spanish hotel chain.
The Spanish newspaper El Confidencial reported that it was the first lawsuit ever filed in Spain by Cuban Americans against Spanish companies that benefit from expropriated properties in Cuba.
The lawsuit follows the Trump administration’s full implementation of Title III of the Helms-Burton Act on May 2. The law allows owners of properties confiscated by the Castro Revolution to file suits in US courts against entities that “traffic” in those properties.
The Sanchez Hills and Melia had been negotiating for some time and had been close to reaching an agreement for 5 million dollars. But the hotel chain, believing that Title III was unlikely to ever be enacted, dropped its offer to 3,000 dollars and no agreement was reached. The lawsuit will be heard by Spanish courts, so it will not be covered by Title III.
The Sanchez Hill family fled to the US from Cuba after the government expropriated its Santa Lucia sugar mill near the eastern city of Holguin and surrounding lands totaling more than 100,000 acres
[40,460 hectares]. The patriarch of the family built the mill in 1857, after he moved to Holguin from Matanzas. But Law 890, signed in 1960 by then Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos, left them with nothing.
Enterprises owned by the Cuban armed forces have since built several hotels on that land, including the Melia Sol Rio de Luna y Mares, Paradisus Rio de Oro, Costa Verde and Playa Costa Verde, among others.
The lawsuit, filed in the city of Palma de Mallorca, demands indemnification equivalent to the benefits the family claims that the hotel chain received from its use of the land during the past five years, according to El Confidencial. It also criticizes the chain for its attitude on the claims against it.
“The illegal nature of this confiscation is known to Melia, which over the past 20 years has ignored the claims by those enterprises and families from which it benefits,” the lawsuit declares, according to the newspaper.
Melia is the foreign company that administers the most hotels in Cuba, at least 34 so far. Iberostar follows it with 20 hotels. Both companies have been strongly criticized by human rights groups and opponents of the Cuban regime because of the circumstances surrounding their investments on the island.
Until 2008, Cubans were barred from staying in tourist hotels, and the salaries of workers in the international hotels now barely stand at a few dozen dollars per month.
“Throughout these 31 years we have been clear: Our bet on Cuba is unconditional. We believe this is totally unfair, all these measures,” Gabriel Escarrer, executive vice president of Melia Hotels International, told Cuban government television after Title III was activated.
“Because of that, we will continue with our plan. We will continue collaborating closely with Cuban authorities in the development of the country’s tourist industry, which I believe is a model in every sense,” he added.
The company expects to have 38 hotels and more than 15,000 rooms on the island by 2020.
Escarrer visited the island with Reyes Maroto, Spain’s minister for industry, trade and tourism, who tried to reassure Spaniards who have invested in Cuba.
She said her government wants Spanish companies to continue investing in the island and contribute to its development. She criticized President Donald Trump but also urged the Cuban government to pay the 300 million dollars owed to Spanish enterprises.

Venezuela is shipping gold to Europe so that it can pay its debt.
Venezuela sent $1.3 billion worth of gold bars to Switzerland in mid-January, according to data from the Swiss Federal Customs Administration.
That gold was shipped out just weeks before two big debt payments due this month, totaling $2.3 billion. On Friday alone, Venezuela has to pay bondholders $1.5 billion.
Venezuela is running out of cash and many experts believe there's a high chance it will default by this fall when a string of big debt payments are due.
"It's a question of when Venezuela will default, not if," says Russ Dallen, managing partner at LatInvest, a firm that invests in Latin America. "They're running out of options."
That's why the country is using its dwindling gold reserves to make debt payments. But experts say it has to ship the gold all the way to Switzerland for two likely reasons:
1. Switzerland is one of the largest hubs for gold in transit and has the most trusted stamp of purity. So once Switzerland verifies the quality of the gold, Venezuela can then sell it for cash.
2. Venezuela can also put up its gold as collateral in exchange for a cash loan from banks in what is known as a "gold swap."
Related: Venezuela raises gas prices 6000%
Some believe the second option is the more likely reason behind the shipment.
Reuters reported earlier in February that Deutsche Bank and Venezuela were negotiating a gold swap. Deutsche Bank declined to comment and Venezuela's central bank did not respond to a request for comment.
This shipment is pretty unusual. Gold is traded a lot, but countries usually keep their gold for safekeeping in places like the Federal Reserve Bank's vault in New York. When they trade gold, it usually goes from one vault to another.
But Venezuela's late president, Hugo Chavez, brought the country's gold bars back to his country in 2011 and 2012, in a show of patriotism.
In the face of major debt payments and economic crisis, now Venezuela is sending its gold back to Europe.
This week, Venezuela revealed that it's total reserves in November had fallen to $14.5 billion, the lowest level since 2003. Of that total sum, $10.9 billion is in gold. It has other reserves at the International Monetary Fund and in other precious items, like diamonds and silver.
Related: Latin America: China's power play right under the U.S.
Experts believe Venezuela has less than $1 billion in cash reserves.
"There are not enough dollars to pay their external debts," says Mauro Roca, an economist at Goldman Sachs. "The economic environment is one of the worst in the world. It's clearly unsustainable."
Any way you look at it, Venezuela is in a severe economic recession. Inflation is skyrocketing -- the IMF estimates it will rise 720% this year. Its economy tanked last year, shrinking 10%. The value of its currency, the bolivar, has plummeted.
Default could soon be knocking on Venezuela's doorstep. In November and October, Venezuela must pay almost $5 billion in debt. Barring lots of help from China -- one of Venezuela's popular sources of finance -- experts believe Venezuela probably will default.

Mexican energy contractor IEnova, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, has signed an agreement with state power utility CFE to temporarily suspend its Guaymas-El Oro natural gas pipeline contract rather than have it canceled.
According to a statement sent to the Mexican stock exchange (BMV), the company took the action because the original contract signed in 2012 specifies that if an event prevents the carrier from providing the natural gas transportation service to CFE for more than two years it would be understood that the contract has ended.
"To avoid termination of the contract, CFE and IEnova signed the suspension agreement so that within a period of four months the parties carry out all necessary actions and within their reach to restart the operation of the pipeline. The signing of the agreement of suspension does not imply any waiver of the rights that the parties have under the contract,” said IEnova in the BMV statement Monday.
The firm added that the suspension agreement reflects "IEnova's commitment" to maintain a dialogue with the Mexican government and CFE to reach a satisfactory agreement.
Guaymas-El Oro has been inactive since 2017 amid a dispute with a faction of the Yaqui indigenous tribe. The community says it never agreed to the construction of a nine-mile segment of the pipeline across tribal territory in Sonora state.
The 320km natural gas pipeline has a carrying capacity of 5.3Bf3/y, or 510Mf3/d. IEnova, owns 14 pipeline projects, including Guaymas-Oro and the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan marine pipeline.
The latter is set to provide capacity to transport 2.6Bf3/d of gas from Texas to Mexico. It was ready for commercial operation in mid-June but was held up after CFE said it would seek arbitration on the contract with IEnova and its partner, TC Energy Corp.
At the heart of the legal battle are contract clauses related to force majeure instances, which require the government to continue paying for pipelines where construction has been halted and which are not yet operational.
Early last month, CFE CEO Manuel Bartlett (pictured) said the company would seek international arbitration over US$899mn in damages, and even though chances of success remain unclear, the issue will create a significant holdup in natural gas exports to Mexico.
IENOVA SIGNALS READINESS
The suspension agreement follows statements from IEnova and Sempra executives in their respective 2Q19 conference calls suggesting they are displeased with the Mexico situation but eager to resolve IT and all other disputes with CFE as quickly as possible.
IEnova CEO Tania Ortiz Mena, said CFE wants to conclude talks on both the Sonora and the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan natural gas pipelines “soon, and, of course, so do we.”
She said discussions would probably not “drag on into next year.”
Ortiz added, “The tone at the dialogue table has been intense to reach a solution quickly.”
In June, IEnova said the US$2.5bn project was expected to deliver a 40% increase in Mexico's current import capacity for natural gas.
Sempra COO Joe Householder told an investors call that regarding Mexico “we are not pleased with the recent developments.”
Householder added that Sempra is confident of its ability to resolve the dispute in a timely manner.
"We think there's a timeline in front of us where we can move through this fairly quickly and I think all the signals have been from the government that they share our interest in resolving this quickly," added Sempra CEO Jeffrey Martin.
The company, in the presentation, added that it is also looking to add an export component to an LNG import facility in Mexico operated by IEnova. A final investment decision on the expansion is expected for the end of the year.
CONSEQUENCES
Speaking at a recent event, former US ambassador to Mexico Carlos Pascual stressed that Mexico is the top export market for US production and warned that the main effect of not reaching agreements is that energy costs will skyrocket for final consumer.

Although it ranks favorably in gender pay gap, Italy cannot crow too loud about it.
Italy is doing better than the rest of Europe in terms of gender pay gap, but the situation of Italian women is not looking very good for different reasons.
Gender pay gap in Europe
Indeed, Eurostat published the data (referring to 2016) concerning the difference between average gross hourly earnings of male and female employees and Italy boasts the second lowest gap (5,3%) after Romania, where women earn 5,2% less than men. On the contrary, the negative record belongs to Estonia (25,3%), immediately followed by Czech Republic (21,8%) and one of the richest countries in Europe, such as Germany (21,5%). The average gender pay gap in the whole European Union is still very high, as the disparity in earnings between men and women reaches 16,2%.
The Eurostat study also highlights different perspectives explaining the reasons that are causing such a large scale problem. For example, ‘the gender pay gap might increase with age as a result of the career interruptions women experience during their working life, particularly older women unable to benefit from specific equality measures which did not yet exist when they started to work’.
Moreover, part of the disparities can be explained by the fact that women struggle to access to sectors and positions with a higher average distribution. This means that the gender pay gap is linked to various legal, cultural and social factors affecting women’s lives well beyond their hourly earnings.
The situation of women in Italy
Therefore, although it ranks favorably in this table, Italy cannot crow too loud about it. Indeed, according to the ‘The Global Gender Gap 2017 Report‘ published by the World Economic Forum, Italy is only 82nd in the global index measuring the gender gap in broader terms. These statistics include factors such as economic participation and opportunity (where Italy ranks 118th), educational attainment (60th), health and survival (123th) and political empowerment (46th).
In conclusion, the situation of Italian women is getting a lot worse, considering that Italy ranked 50th in the previous yearly report. Although the country comes first in terms of women enrolment in tertiary education, the estimate is pretty cold for all the other indicators. The score card brings to light all the limits of a countrywide system that needs to be changed as soon as possible for the increasing achievement of full equal treatment between genders.

USA TODAY
WASHINGTON – The Great Wall of Mick is making its way across across America.
The Rolling Stones' No Filter tour – the first expansive U.S. swing in at least four years –is traversing the country this summer. Each time the rocking septuagenarians have conducted an extensive tour, fans have wondered whether that would be the last time.
But the Stones have constantly played some live shows across the globe each year since then, including hitting Desert Trip in California in 2016.
The stage setup for this tour, used in the No Filter shows last year in the U.K. and Europe, represents a technological advance that puts more focus on the Stones themselves, says Dale Skjerseth, the tour's production director.

In the past, Stones' tours have involved majestic stage designs such as the Voodoo Lounge (1994-1995) and Steel Wheels (1989-1990) tours. And the band has incorporated large props including giant dragons, a blowup doll and, perhaps most famously, a giant inflatable male sex organ.
But this new stage design is streamlined with four six-story-tall LED video screens, each encompassing about 1.5 million pixels delivering super high-def footage of the band.
"The concept is them and their music," Skjerseth said. "The quality of the video is the highest we can get at this point with this large of scale. After that, there’s a point you don’t want to go because it really shows items on peoples’ faces you don’t want to see."
Skjerseth, who has worked on Stones tours since 1994, took time to talk about the tour here prior to the band's concert at FedEx Field on July 3. The tour has 40 trucks that transport two sets of the massive, 70-foot steel structures that hold the video displays from venue to venue.
Each tour stop requires four days of setup – another steel apparatus was in Foxboro, Mass. for the next concert on the itinerary (Sunday, July 7). The setup in Washington was sent to New Orleans for a July 14 concert after it was taken down Thursday.
Another 25 trucks transport production equipment, including the video operation, which is housed under the stage. Overall, about 300 people –150 local workers and 150 who travel with the tour – help with the production, Skjerseth says.
The tour opened June 21 in Chicago after it was postponed for about two months when frontman Mick Jagger had heart valve replacement surgery.
Jagger has been super active and animated in the first shows on the tour. The stage includes a 104-foot runway that juts into the center of the stadium for the lead singer to scamper on.
The band seems rejuvenated, Skjerseth says. "I think it’s gone to that level with them coming back after Mick's surgery (that) 'We are really lucky to be all alive and well and happy.' They all have always taken into account their fitness and their mindset and their drive for the show," he said. "But it's actually taken another step up to another level of being better. You wouldn’t notice Mick had (the heart operation). We all had to shift gears and slow down for a minute, but now we are in the groove."

TAIPEI - Cryptocurrency exchanges are growing in the Philippines, despite a downturn last year in the value of the virtual currencies, due to growing popular demand and lenience among regulators.
Authorities in the developing Southeast Asian country have permitted at least 29 exchanges of cryptocurrency following three that the central bank said it approved this week, according to domestic media reports.
That count, which is high for Asia, follows a total of 10 exchanges permitted by the central bank. The Cagayan Economic Zone Authority in the archipelago's far north has issued 19 additional permits, the zone's website said in October.
These exchanges feed into the development of a fast-growing financial technology, or fintech, sector in the Philippines, said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist with Banco de Oro UniBank in Metro Manila.
"Fintech appears to be very advanced in the Philippines," he said. Consumers, he said, "eventually look at the mobility of having it in mobile wallets, [which] gives them flexibility to use money."
Uses for cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency, most notably its standard bearer Bitcoin, became an investment vehicle in much of the world about a decade ago. But a 70% drop in Bitcoin prices last year weakened enthusiasm for crypto overall.

FILE - A man walks past an electric board showing exchange rates of various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, at a cryptocurrencies exchange in Seoul, South Korea, Dec. 13, 2017.
?Filipinos generally pick more traditional investments such as equities, Ravelas said, but young companies are eyeing cryptocurrency to raise capital, a process called initial coin offerings. Seven in 10 Filipinos have no bank account, he added, so virtual currency gives those consumers a new option for making payments.
That population would be able to jump on a currency source that's open to anyone and transparent because of its online transaction ledger called the blockchain.
Government support
The central bank governor may see the cryptocurrency trade as part of his bigger plan to advance the country's electronic payment systems, analysts say.
Cryptocurrency "probably goes toward those efforts at facilitating electronic payments. I think that's the key point," said Christian de Guzman, vice president and senior credit officer with Moody's Sovereign Risk Group in Singapore.
The 2016 National Payment Systems Act, among others, "bolsters the central bank's capacity to foster the efficiency of payment systems as pipelines of funds in the financial market," the authority's governor Benjamin Diokno said in a speech last month.
The central bank and Securities and Exchange Commission are "working towards regulating cryptocurrencies to protect the Filipino people," domestic Bitcoin and blockchain news website Bitpinas said in November. "This is a positive step towards adoption as this move will give users security and confidence in dealing with it."
Said de Guzman: "A certain segment of the population is certainly very technically sophisticated."
First mover advantage?
The Philippines, though later than much of East Asia in picking up cryptocurrency, would eventually stand out if regulators embrace rather than restrict it.
China and South Korea have placed curbs on certain types of crypto trade. Both banned initial coin offerings in 2017, and China ordered the closure of cryptocurrency exchanges as part of that move. South Korea has at least 21 exchanges.

?Japan is widely seen as Asia's most liberal place for cryptocurrency. That country, which has let 17 exchanges fully register, overtook China in 2017 as the biggest Bitcoin market in the world with 58 percent of the global volume. Japan declared Bitcoin legal tender in 2017.
The Philippines in its current groove should take a "first mover advantage," said Kenneth Ameduri, financial analyst and CEO of the crypto-specialized news website Crush the Street in the United States.
"I think the Philippines understand that it's going to be a very big deal to be involved with cryptocurrency, because it's going to happen no matter what, and if they're the ones to treat this capital best, the capital is going to flow there and the other jurisdictions are just going to completely miss out," Ameduri said.
The Philippines might eventually look harder at the role of cryptocurrency in falsifying tax payments and paying for illegal drugs, de Guzman said. Taxation and drugs are already sticky issues without crypto.
Exchanges contacted for this report declined comment.

Buying a property is challenging enough with complicated mortgage forms and fragile chains where a deal can collapse in an instant.
But the buying process isn't made any simpler with some of the terms used by estate agents to describe the properties they are trying to sell.
Often it's not enough just to have a simple asking price, other terms that commonly appear on property adverts include phrases such as 'offers in excess of', 'guide price' and 'price on application'.
So what does these mean and how much attention do you really need to pay to them when making an offer? MailOnline Property spoke to a buying agent - who helps to find homes and negotiate a better price for house hunters - to find out.
Confused? Estate agents use terms such as 'Price on Application' or 'POA' on property adverts
Offers in excess of
We began with the term 'offers in excess of'.
An estate agent adds this phrase to the front of a price to indicate that they want offers higher than stated, such as 'offers in excess of £350,000'.
But there is a subtext of such a phrase, and what it says about a property's price, according to buying agent Henry Pryor.
He translated it, saying that, in reality, what this phrase means is that those selling the property 'want more than it's worth'.
He said: 'A buyer decides what a property is worth, the owner has the luxury of deciding if it’s enough.'
‹ Slide me › What is the meaning behind the phrase 'offers in excess of'?
But do you have to make an offer in excess of the figure? Many potential buyers may worry if they don't it will be disregarded, particularly if bids are being invited to be sent in by a set date on the property.
Mr Pryor says: 'Regardless of what the asking price is you should offer what the property is worth to you. Agents are paid to do the best for their client and they have different ways of doing this. Some charm, some flirt, some bully, some try to justify prices by talking about what other houses sold for or talk about prices per square foot. Ignore them, bid what the property is worth to you.
'Make sure that you stress the advantages of your bid, that you have a lawyer ready, that you have a mortgage agreement in principle, that your offer isn’t subject to the sale of another home (hopefully) and that you can move at a pace to suit the seller. Eighty-five per cent of homes sell for less than the asking price, so your seller won’t be the first to be disappointed.
And he went on to say: 'If you are invited to bid in an informal tender then bid as if it were a formal tender or auction - put your best foot forward, bidding as if it were your best and final offer, and then if someone bids more then they either loved it more or had more money.'
Guide price
One of the most common terms on property adverts is 'a guide price', which can also leave buyers wondering what to offer.
Mr Pryor explained that what this phrase is telling buyers is that the agent thinks it is worth this much, but ultimately they are not sure.
‹ Slide me › What does the property listings phrase 'a guide price of' mean?
Price on application
One of the phrases seen on expensive homes is 'price on application', which tends to suggest a certain exclusivity about the property - the implication being if you need to ask the price, you can't afford it.
However, Mr Pryor suggested that what 'price on application' really means is something quite different.
He said: 'What it really means is, "At the very least we want your details so we can contact you when our client sobers up and we can quote a sensible price".'
‹ Slide me › What do you think 'price on application' is telling buyers?
Offers invited
The phrase 'offers invited' also makes an appearance on property listings, with Mr Pryor claiming that the estate agent doesn't actually have a clue about what price the property is worth and is instead telling buyers 'you tell us'.
‹ Slide me › What is the hidden meaning in the phrase 'offers invited'?
So what should you offer?
Mr Pryor suggested that most of these estate agency terms are meaningless as 'price is what you ask, value is what you get'.
He continued: 'The asking price is an indication of the seller's greed or the estate agent's enthusiasm to get the business.
'I've never met a seller who thinks their property is less than the estate agent's valuation or the other house for sale in the road.'

Supercell ha liberado otra de las prometidas novedades de la última actualización, el evento La Fiebre del Oro. Desde hoy hasta el próximo lunes 6 de noviembre, tendremos la oportunidad de ganar un buen puñado de monedas para mejorar a nuestras tropas o comprar en la tienda.
La idea es que, dependiendo de la Arena en la que te encuentres, puedas ganar oro adicional al destruir las torres de tu enemigo en batallas 1c1.El bote máximo al que se puede aspirar es de 5.000 monedas en Arena 11, así que vale la pena dedicarle algo de tiempo al juego durante este fin de semana.
El modo no incluye nada especial más allá del nuevo skin de las torres y la posibilidad de ganar oro extra, pero con la euforia de la actualización a Supercell se le había olvidado comentar un nuevo añadido que no tiene tan buena pinta como todo lo mostrado hasta ahora: los potenciadores especiales.
Por un precio de 300 gemas cada uno, podremos comprar potenciadores que, durante siete días, nos permitirán ganar más oro con cada victoria, conseguir más cartas y oro en los cofres de coronas y, por último, acelerar la apertura de cofres. Ayudas así no necesariamente van a hacer que un jugador principiante llegue de cabeza a la Arena 11, pero preocupa que Supercell abra un pastel que no necesitaba.
El tema de las ayudas vía hard-coin, aquellas monedas enfocadas a que gastes dinero en el juego (en este caso las gemas), siempre son un terreno peligroso al que muchos se pueden agarrar para hablar de pay-to-win, no sin falta de razón. La buena noticia es que, por lo que parece, estos potenciadores estarán disponibles por tiempo limitado y no serán una oferta fija de la tienda. La mala es que, si tienen mucha aceptación, a Supercell no le temblará la mano a la hora de seguir apoyando este tipo de medidas.

Abbonamenti pirata alla pay tv, tremano 11mila clienti. La Polizia di Palermo ha disarticolato un'infrastruttura informatica, gestita dalla piattaforma Tv pirata 'ZSat', che permetteva la riproduzione abusiva, attraverso internet, dell'intero palinsesto. L'operazione è stata compiuta dal personale della sezione financial cybercrime della Polizia Postale, coordinato dalla Procura di Palermo, che ha denunciato un 35enne per violazione della legge sul diritto di autore. Nella sua abitazione è stata trovato la 'sorgentè della piattaforma pirata 'ZSat', composta da 57 decoder di, collegati ad apparati per la ritrasmissione sulla rete internet, per un giro di clienti finali stimato in circa 11.000 persone in tutta Italia, nei confronti delle quali potrebbero configurarsi reati.Nella casa la polizia postale ha sequestrato, nascosti negli scarichi dei bagni e nella spazzatura, ben 186.900 euro in contanti ed una macchina professionale conta-banconote, lingotti d'oro, e due «wallet» hardware (portafogli virtuali) contenenti cryptomoneta in diverse valute, dall'elevato valore. Tecnicamente, le piattaforme Tv pirata rendono possibile la visione, attraverso internet, dei canali delle pay-tv normalmente trasmessi via satellite, attraverso la stipula di abbonamenti illeciti i quali, a fronte di costi irrisori per il cliente finale e dietro l'istallazione di un semplice dispositivo domestico (il cosiddetto 'Pezzottò), offrono la possibilità di accedere all'intero palinsesto, nazionale ed internazionale, delle più note emittenti satellitari a pagamento.Un fenomeno capace di generare un business milionario (gli investigatori stimano che fino allo scorso anno i profitti illeciti ammontassero ad oltre 700 milioni di euro all'anno), che da un lato si traduce in mancati incassi per gli operatori e dall'altro costituisce una fonte di approvvigionamento per pericolosi settori criminali, che spesso risultano contigui con la criminalità organizzata nazionale ed internazionale. Proprio a riprova dell'entità del giro di affari illecito, nella sola abitazione dell'indagato gli uomini della sezione financial cybercrime della polizia postale hanno trovato e sequestrato, nascosti negli scarichi dei bagni e nella spazzatura, ben 186.900 euro in contanti ed una macchina professionale conta-banconote, lingotti d'oro, e due «wallet» hardware (portafogli virtuali) contenenti cryptomoneta in diverse valute, il cui valore complessivo, certamente elevato, verrà meglio stimato a seguito degli ulteriori accertamenti tecnici.

When pensioners Joan and Alex Babb discovered their annual council tax bill was the same as their neighbour's they were surprised.
Their Gloucestershire home is a one-bedroom bungalow, while neighbours on the other side of the road live in three-bedroom semi-detached houses with garages.
All are charged £1,232, but when Joan, 73, challenged her Band B bill she was met with a response that highlights the problems of many homeowners around the country who feel they are paying the wrong amount.
The council said that despite the obvious difference in properties the bill stood. The couple's challenge was denied on the basis that the banding was correct at the time it was set at the beginning of the 1990s.
Pensioners Joan and Alex Babb were surprised that their bungalow's council tax band was the same as their neighbours' three-bed two-storey houses
The couple were annoyed that their challenge had been turned down and contacted the Valuation Office Agency, but again hit a brick wall.
Mrs Babb told MailOnline Property: 'Whatever the value was at that exact point, it would be very close to the base of band B, though I strongly suspect, below it.
'However, these aren't just average houses - they are tiny homes for last-time buyers.
'They are for those who have downsized to the max for a reason, such as to make the most of their retirement funds, with most of them occupied by very elderly single people with little income.'
She continued: 'Far from being 'fair', as suggested, it just cannot be equitable that we have to pay the same council tax as families in spacious three-bed semis with garages.'
Jon Topping, head of policy and resources at Gloucester City Council, said: 'Council tax bands are set by the Valuation Office Agency and councils are obliged to charge according to these bands.
'Currently the VOA has set the band for properties located in their road at Band B.
'Taxpayers are able to challenge the banding on their property if they believe it to be incorrect and details of how to do this are available on the leaflet that accompanies the bill or can be found on the council's website.'
A neighbour's semi-detached house with three bedrooms is in the same council tax band
The failure of successive governments to do a full revaluation for council tax since its introduction means that many people think their property is charged the wrong amount. Conservative Party said in 2008 that it believed 400,000 homes were in the wrong bands.
A VOA spokesperson said: 'As we've explained to the customer, sales evidence on the properties indicates that band B is correct, as the properties were sold in 1990 and 1991 for more than £40,000 which is within the Band B range.
'As each Council Tax band includes a range of values, a range of different properties can fall within the same band.
'If a taxpayer has concerns about their Council Tax band, they can contact the VOA at any time to explain why they think it might be wrong.'
Council tax bands are based on what your house was worth in 1991, as that's when and how the council tax bands were defined
How to challenge your council tax
It is possible to challenge a council tax band, but homeowners can often find it is very difficult to secure a change.
A list of the type of evidence required to challenging a banding is available by clicking here.
The list includes sending addresses of up to five similar properties in a lower council tax band, which need to be a similar age, style and design, size and type, along with evidence from property prices.
Technically, you cannot just ask for your band to be lowered - only for it to be reassessed. This means your band could be moved up, as well as down.
Mrs Babb called on the VOA to 'come and take a look for themselves as the evidence is blindingly obvious'.
She added: 'Suggesting that these pensioners visit an online site to prove otherwise unfortunately just shows how out of touch with reality this authority is, with the very customers who have no choice but to continue to pay their wages.'

The Reko Diq mine has become a test case for Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ability to attract serious foreign investment to Pakistan as it struggles to stave off an economic crisis that has forced it to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout.
Ten current and former provincial and federal government officials and mining sources familiar with the project in the Baluchistan region say the military has become the most important voice on the future of Reko Diq, which it sees as a strategic national asset.
The military will not only be in a position to decide which investors develop the deposit, but an army-controlled engineering firm, Frontier Works Organization (FWO), is positioning itself to be a member of any consortium involved, these people said.
“This has been taken over by GHQ,” said a senior Baluchistan government official, referring to the Pakistan army’s General Headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.
In a statement in response to Reuters’ questions about its role in Reko Diq, the military spokesman’s office said: “(The military) may only participate in government’s plan of development of Reko Diq, as per national requirements.”
But it acknowledged that FWO, best known for building roads through Pakistan’s rugged and lawless border regions, has developed “substantial” mining capability in recent years and would be interested in taking a role in the project.
“If an opportunity arises of participating in developing Reko Diq, FWO may work at par with other competitors (or) companies provided the project is financially viable (or) suitable,” the statement said. When asked, a spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement.
Pakistan’s Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said civilian authorities in the insurgency-hit southwestern province of Baluchistan were in charge of Reko Diq and, along with Khan, would take a decision, but added that the military “and all other stakeholders are obviously important players”.
FWO referred questions to the military spokesman’s office. Khan’s spokesman Iftikhar Durrani said Baluchistan province was in charge of Reko Diq, and referred questions to the provincial government and the military spokesman’s office.
The manoeuvring behind the project shows how the military, which has historically dictated Pakistan’s security and foreign policy, is leveraging its sway over the civilian government at federal and provincial level to carve a growing role in the nation’s business affairs.
The army has ruled the nuclear-armed nation for nearly half its history and is considered to have a major influence over Khan’s recently elected government. A military spokesman declined to comment.
“The military has taken a front seat,” said Ayesha Siddiqa, author of the book “Military Inc.”, which analyses the army’s business interests and influence in Pakistan.
“They’ve understood that the economy is important for having a strong military,” she said. “Control of the economy also gives the military a handle over expanding their business interests.”
TALKS
Buried at the foot of an extinct volcano near the frontier with Iran and Afghanistan, the mine’s development has long been delayed by a dispute with previous investors in the project, Canada’s Barrick Gold and Chile’s Antofagasta.
The government is urgently trying to settle the dispute as a World Bank arbitration tribunal, which ruled against Pakistan in 2017, is in the next few months expected to announce how much in damages the country must pay to the foreign firms, who are claiming more than $11 billion.
The dispute relates to the withholding of a mining lease.
Islamabad is also trying to find new partners to invest in the project.
But any new investors will need the blessing of Pakistan’s military, according to government officials and mining sources.
State-run companies from resource-hungry China have long coveted Reko Diq and more recently Saudi Arabia has shown interest, according to Pakistani officials.
Some Western diplomats say the Reko Diq dispute has been a significant foreign investment deterrent, with international businesses unnerved at how Pakistan dealt with the companies that had pledged to invest $3.3 billion to develop the country’s then-biggest mining project.
Barrick Gold and Antofagasta, whose joint venture Tethyan Copper Company (TCC) discovered vast mineral wealth in Reko Diq, say they had invested more than $220 million by the time the Baluchistan government, in 2011, unexpectedly refused to grant them the critical mining lease needed to keep operating.
Pakistan argued its move was legitimate because TCC’s feasibility study was incomplete and the country’s Supreme Court voided the deal in 2013. But in 2017 the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled against Pakistan.
TCC did not respond to requests for comment and Antofagasta and Barrick Gold both declined to comment. Reuters could not determine whether either company would be willing to return to the project.
FOREIGN INVESTORS
The last serious attempt at settling the Reko Diq case was scuppered in 2016 by the military, which vetoed paying hundreds of millions of dollars to TCC, according to a senior Baluchistan official and two former senior officials in Islamabad.
But the military has since changed its stance and is more open to a settlement with TCC, according to a lawmaker close to the military and a source close to Prime Minister Khan. The military was also involved in appointing Pakistan’s current legal team.
In response to a Reuters question about blocking the previous settlement effort, the military said: “Let’s see how the case progresses.” It did not elaborate or comment on whether it was playing any role in the latest negotiations.
Some mining experts say a likely solution would be for a new investment consortium to pay the settlement fee on behalf of cash-strapped Pakistan in exchange for future royalty fees or mining rights.
Information Minister Chaudhry said Pakistan was engaged in negotiations with “both” the current investors about a settlement and also potential new investors, with interest coming from the Middle East and Europe. He declined to name the potential investors.
Pakistani Finance Minister Asad Umar said in October that Saudi Arabia has inquired about investing in Reko Diq and another government official confirmed talks were ongoing.
Saudi Arabia did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Reko Diq. During Crown Prince bin Salman’s visit to Pakistan last month, the kingdom pledged to invest $2 billion in mineral development projects, though the provisional agreements were vague and did not mention any specific projects.
China’s state-owned miner China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), which operates the Saindak copper and gold mine close to Reko Diq, has been eyeing the bigger deposit for more than a decade, according to mining and MCC officials.
A few years ago Chinese state giant Norinco also made an approach, according to two sources familiar with Norinco’s offer.
MCC and Norinco did not respond to requests for comment.
When a mining company approached former general Abdul Quadir Baloch about Reko Diq around 2016, when he was federal minister for the frontier regions, he took their proposal not only to then-premier Nawaz Sharif, but also to the army chief.
“The military has to give a (security) guarantee to any company coming in to explore or exploit this project, so they are a stakeholder,” said Baloch.
The military declined to comment on Baloch’s assertions. Sharif, who has since been jailed on corruption charges, could not be reached for comment.

The army-run FWO does not have the funds or the expertise to develop the Reko Diq project, which boasts 5.9 billion tons of ore. But it could be part of a consortium alongside global miners who have the know-how to mine such a gargantuan deposit.
The military’s role in developing natural resources in Baluchistan also carries risks, however, analysts say.
Indigenous Baloch people view outsiders with suspicion, and their anger about Islamabad exploiting the province’s vast natural resources has been one of the key themes fuelling a separatist insurgency that began around 2004.

Cagayan de Oro water district officials face charges 258 SHARES Share it! Share Tweet
By Czarina Nicole Ong
Palawan Governor Jose Alvarez and several officials of the Cagayan de Oro Water District (COWD) have been slapped with graft and breach of conduct charges before different divisions of the Sandiganbayan due to the reportedly anomalous transactions in several water projects.
Alvarez, in his capacity as the president of Rio Verde Water Consortium Inc. (RVW Consortium), together with COWD chairman Francisco Mendez, treasurer Sarah Borja, secretary Raymundo Java, assistant secretary Sandy Bass Sr. – all part of the board of directors – together with general manager Gaspar Gonzales Jr., and Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) administrator Lorenzo Jamora have all been charged with a violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
Their case went to the Second Division.
On December 2004, the local officials were accused of giving undue advantage to Alvarez when they declared the company as a qualified bidder for the Bulk Water Supply Project (BWSP).
The award was made solely on the recommendation of the BWSP and not the bids and awards committee (BAC) of the COWD. They even signed the BWSP contract even though it is not in accord with the model contract. At the same time, they did not pay heed to the legal advice of the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel to file an action for reformation of the contract in court.
The next graft charge, which went to the Third Division, involved some of the same COWD officials but with different positions.
This time, it is headed by chairman Raymundo Java, vice chairman Bass Sr., treasurer Bibiana Sarmiento, secretary Joel Baldelovar, and general manager Gonzales Jr. Private individual Edward Chona, president of Geo-Transport and Construction Inc., was likewise included in the charge sheet.
On December 2005, the officials were accused of giving unwarranted benefit to Chona’s company by awarding it the contract for the phase III improvement/expansion project – lateral transport via negotiated procurement.
They did not undergo public bidding. And despite the absence of requirements under R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, they still paid Geo-Transport P14,723,041.22.
The third charge for violation of Section 7(d) of R.A. 6713, also known the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards, also went to the Third Division. It involved respondents Java, Bass Sr., Sarmiento, and Baldelovar.
Back in 2006, they once again transacted with Chona and accepted from him two units of water trucks and one brand new Toyota Revo in connection with the award for Phase III Improvement/Expansion Project – Lateral Improvement Project under Supplemental Agreement No. 2.
Mendez, Borja, Jamora, Alvarez, and Chona have to pay P30,000 each for their provisional liberty. Java and Bass Sr. have to pay P70,000 each – P30,000 per graft charge and P10,000 for the breach of conduct charge. Gonzales Jr. has to pay P60,000, while Sarmiento and Baldelovar have to pay P40,000 each.

PayPal has entered into a global partnership with B2B ecommerce company Oro, an open-source business applications firm started in 2012 by founders and employees of Magento, the B2C ecommerce startup acquired by eBay a year earlier.
One of Oro’s core offerings is OroCommerce, which was officially unveiled a couple of months back to serve mid-size and large companies with myriad B2B ecommerce tools that make it easier to manage price lists, customize catalogs, manage corporate accounts and relationships, and automate workflows.
With PayPal in tow, the duo have now created a “fully integrated payments solution” that enables Oro’s clients to provide their own customers with an easy way to pay for goods and services.
Though PayPal is better known for its B2C and P2P payments facilities, the company does have some presence in the B2B realm. Back in 2013, it launched its Working Capital program to lend money to small businesses, and it has gone on to lend billions of dollars in the intervening years. Elsewhere, PayPal announced an integration with accountancy software platform Reckon last July, allowing businesses to include a “pay now” option on invoices that link to various payment mechanisms, including PayPal. This was followed shortly afterward by a similar tie-up with SME invoicing platform Xero.
PayPal was spun out of eBay back in 2015 and started trading again as a public company in its own right after more than a decade as a subsidiary. The company’s shares have peaked and troughed over the past 18 months, but they remain roughly flat. An obvious route to growth for PayPal is B2B ecommerce, a market that is expected to hit $6.7 trillion globally by 2020 — double that of its B2C counterpart. And this is why PayPal is pushing into more partnerships on that front.
“Having been the market leader in B2C payments for more than a decade, we are now seeing a growing adoption rate of PayPal by B2B businesses,” said Jason Smith, head of PayPal global channel partners. “As the industry’s first ecommerce platform built specifically for B2B companies, OroCommerce has both the expertise and resources we need to help us deliver greater value and provide better payment experience for our B2B merchants.”

The once-fringe fantasy of a return to the gold standard is creeping back into the mainstream.
It has long been dismissed as a fool’s errand, on par with abandoning the Federal Reserve and other trappings of the modern economy. Mainstream economists deride it almost without exception. Reintroducing the gold standard would “be a disaster for any large advanced economy,” says the University of Chicago’s Anil Kashyap, who connects enthusiasm for it with “macroeconomic illiteracy.” His colleague, Nobel laureate Richard Thaler, struggles with its very underlying principle: “Why tie to gold? Why not 1982 Bordeaux?”
Yet the idea that every US dollar should be backed by a small amount of actual gold is more popular than economists’ opinions might suggest. Advocates include members of Congress and president Donald Trump. Enthusiasm for a return to the gold standard has become more prominent since Trump’s most recent nominees to fill the vacant Federal Reserve governorship have endorsed a return. The first two—Herman Cain and Stephen Moore—both dropped out of consideration, but the third, economist Judy Shelton, announced today in a Trump tweet, may be the most ardent in her support.
Last year, Shelton called for a “new Bretton Woods conference,” akin to the 1944 meeting that established the post-war economic order, perhaps to be held at Mar-a-Lago, where a return to the gold standard could be considered. “We make America great again by making America’s money great again,” she wrote in the journal of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

Since 2011, at least six states have passed laws recognizing gold and silver as currency; another three are presently contemplating bills of their own. The surprising success of Ron Paul, a Texas Republican Congressman and ardent gold bug, in the 2008 and 2012 elections showed the potency of these ideas among the electorate. In its 2012 and 2016 campaign platforms, the Republican Party called for a commission to investigate the viability of a return to a gold standard system. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill including such a commission in both 2015 and 2017, but both times the proposals died in the Senate. Last year, Alexander Mooney, a Republican representative from West Virginia, took that a step further when he introduced a bill proposing a full-on return to the gold standard. (The bill has no cosponsors and, unsurprisingly, has gone nowhere.)
Today, with inflation unusually low and stable, the gold standard is a tougher sell than it once was. But as trust in American institutions wanes, there is renewed support for money backed by something tangible, not the say-so of the government. If inflation picks up once again, a solid base of gold standard evangelists is ready to take it mainstream. That a supporter of the gold standard may yet wind up on the Fed’s board of governors is yet more evidence that the idea’s prospects are shining brighter than they have in many years .
How the gold standard works
Money depends on trust—the faith that it will hold its value so that, when the time comes to spend it, it will be accepted without question in exchange for what the holder expects it to be worth. Inflation eats away at that value.
In modern times, governments are often a culprit behind inflation. Since they enjoy a monopoly on printing money, they can issue new currency at virtually no cost. But governments are run by vote-seeking politicians, who might print more money to juice short-term growth needed to win re-election, inadvertently causing inflation to flare up later. This quandary isn’t theoretical, and has happened with surprising frequency throughout history. To cite a recent, prominent example, US president Richard Nixon bent to this temptation (pdf) during his 1972 re-election campaign—contributing to the breakout of inflation that ravaged the American economy throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.
There’s a seemingly easy fix: Take the power of money creation out of the hands of politicians. According to the monetarist theory popularized by economist Milton Friedman in the 1970s, preventing inflation requires fixing the supply of money. The gold standard, by limiting the dollars the government can print to the weight of gold it holds in reserves, is one way of doing so.
The US adopted the gold standard in 1879, when Congress finally followed Britain, Germany, France, and other advanced nations. By holding national currencies stable against gold, the international embrace of the gold standard encouraged foreign investment and facilitated trade, giving rise to the first era of intense globalization.
Here’s a very cartoonish version of how it worked: The US Treasury agreed to redeem a set weight of gold in exchange for a fixed number of dollars, and vice versa. During the classical gold standard era—from 1879 to 1914 in the US—one troy ounce of gold fetched $21.
The gold standard’s discipline came from the fact that the government had to be sure it held the necessary volume of gold in reserve, in case anyone wanted to exchange dollars for a set amount of the shiny metal. If it printed more money than it held in gold reserves, the state risked hyperinflation or causing a financial crisis by shattering faith in the solidity of its currency.
In theory, the gold standard, therefore, limits government spending to only what it can raise in taxes or borrow against its gold reserve, and prevents it from simply printing money to pay its debts. It also takes power over the money supply away from central bankers. Indeed, it might render central banks mostly unnecessary. Bear in mind that for most of the classical gold standard era, the US didn’t have a central bank, which was introduced in 1913.
But why gold?
Had history worked out differently, the dollar might have been pegged to cowrie shells, peppercorns, or giant stone disks, all of which, like gold, have served as money at one time or another. But for reasons both aesthetic and practical, the glimmering metal became the asset of choice. “The simple answer to that is that for the last 5,000 years, so far as we are aware, man has used gold and silver as money, and particularly gold,” says Alasdair Macleod, the head of research at Goldmoney, a Toronto-based investment manager for precious metals. “It’s durable, people respect that it’s got value—it’s actually as simple as that. It is something which markets should be free to choose, and they have chosen gold.”
“Markets should be free to choose, and they have chosen gold.”
Gold is integral to the story of US growth and prosperity. In the 19th century, discoveries of subterranean veins in at least 24 states were “rungs in a ladder that culminated in America’s economic domination of the globe,” prompting westward migration and economic expansion, writes James Ledbetter in One Nation Under Gold: How One Precious Metal Has Dominated the American Imagination for Four Centuries. It is a national emblem of wealth, and “streets paved with gold” served as a myth that helped lure many migrants to the US. “From the very beginnings of our national life, it has seemed impossible for Americans to look at gold dispassionately,” Ledbetter explains. “The metal, and its seductive hint of boundless wealth, tap into a psychological wellspring that reaches beyond any purely physical qualities.”
Legislation in the past century which codified and restricted how Americans could attain or trade gold seems to have intensified the longing for it. In 1933, Americans were temporarily barred from buying and selling gold within the country; by the 1950s, the law was still in place, and a black market for gold flourished. John F. Kennedy was anxious that the dollar should be “as good as gold”; Operation Goldfinger, which launched a few years later, was a top-secret government campaign to dig up gold within US territories as quickly as possible, with the hope of propping up a post-war economy expanding at a pace that threatened to outstrip the world’s supply of the metal.
The gold standard is inextricably tied to mining. The supply of the metal depends on how much is extracted from the earth, after all. But since mining only adds a tiny fraction to the overall stock of gold each year, prices don’t fluctuate as wildly as they used to. In the height of mining activity, in the mid-1800s, big gold discoveries in California and Australia spurred a pickup in inflation. Then, as economic growth outpaced the rate of new gold discoveries, a 20-year period of deflation set in; it ended with new discoveries in South Africa and the Yukon, as well as technological advances in gold processing. That’s how things are supposed to work: When a gold shortage causes purchasing power to rise steadily, mining companies are encouraged to find more gold.

And indeed, overall, prices and real economic activity during the classical gold standard era was remarkably stable (pdf). “If you look at the US during its classical gold standard period, the average rate of inflation is pretty close to zero—and likewise in Great Britain over its experience with the gold standard,” says Lawrence White, an economics professor at George Mason University and one of the few respected economists who’s pro-gold standard.
Gold-standard adherents often extol the strength of currencies such as the pound and the dollar in the early 20th century. Modern central banking, they say, has knocked the stuffing out of these once mighty currencies. (The fact that average hourly wages have mostly been adjusted to match the rise in inflation doesn’t seem to factor into the equation.) Where mainstream economists see constraint, goldbugs see discipline—a government that cannot spend beyond its means—and a hedge against corruption. For those who believe in small, limited government, there is obvious appeal. Believers credit it with a kind of Midas touch: the gold standard necessarily begets “balanced budgets, low taxes, small government and a healthy economy,” to borrow the words of economist Barry Eichengreen, a prominent historian of currencies at the University of California, Berkeley.
“It didn’t quite deliver the kind of nirvana that people now talk about.”
The thing is, economic success during the classical gold standard era depends somewhat on the eye of the beholder. David Laidler, a monetary historian at Western University in Ontario and Friedman’s research assistant in the 1960s, says the gold standard wasn’t as effortlessly successful as the data might suggest.
“I’m not going to tell you that the gold standard didn’t function in the 19th century—it did. But it didn’t quite deliver the kind of nirvana that people now talk about,” he says.
For some Americans, its effects were downright devastating. After the US adopted the gold standard in the 1870s, price levels of agricultural commodities fell continuously for nearly 20 years, crushing American farmers under the weight of their debts and punishing interest rates. The resulting political upheaval culminated in William Jennings Bryan’s famous “cross of gold” speech: his tirade against how deflation caused by the gold standard was ravaging rural America.
Questions of money are always political, and often a zero-sum choice between which economic class will prosper and which will suffer. Inflation erodes the value of financial assets, hurting savers but helping borrowers. Deflation benefits those with wealth and punishes debtors. Eventually, the latter group—the masses whose standard of living relies on mortgages and other forms of debt—tends to win out.
Why aren’t we on the gold standard now?
The classical gold standard era ended with World War I, because to fund wars governments have to print a lot of money. In these conditions, maintaining gold convertibility goes out the window. After the war ended, the US and most other advanced economies scrambled to re-peg their currencies to gold. But for a host of reasons—for example, the overvaluation of the pound and several other key currencies, and the decline of Britain as an imperial power—the gold standard failed to deliver the stability of the earlier era.
Many economists argue it amplified the shocks of the Great Depression, particularly in the US and France, which waited longer than their trading partners to abandon convertibility. It was for this reason that John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, called the gold standard a “barbarous relic.” Unsurprisingly, the post-World War II monetary system—of which Keynes was a key architect—made the US dollar the basis of world reserves. The dollar itself was still convertible into gold. However, other global currencies fixed their exchange rates not to gold, but to the dollar.
When Richard Nixon took office in the late 1960s, the US government was again spending heavily, due to the Vietnam War and the social welfare programs launched by his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson. That effectively pushed down the value of the dollar. In 1971, to stave off a run on US gold reserves, Nixon halted convertibility (meaning that other countries could no longer redeem dollars for gold). Under intensifying pressure, in 1973 the president scrapped the gold standard altogether.
Nixon took the US of the gold standard
Prices started climbing, exacerbated by Nixon’s strong-arming of the Fed to keep rates low. As the 1970s wore on and inflation surged, gold found support among the likes of Ronald Reagan, who talked it up on the campaign trail during the 1980 presidential election. By June 1980, prices for consumer goods were rising 14% annually, galvanizing public support for “sound money.” After trouncing Jimmy Carter, Reagan set up a commission to determine whether to revive the gold standard.
Nixon had promised, and perhaps believed, that the US would eventually return to the gold standard. Reagan’s victory made that look possible—likely, even. But many of the president’s appointees to the commission were longtime opponents of the system (among the exceptions was a certain young Texas congressman named Ron Paul). Then came the “Volcker shock,” when Fed chairman Paul Volcker hiked rates to their highest levels in history to curb runaway inflation, which thrust the economy into a deep recession. Crucially, though, inflation dropped sharply and the commission put the official kibosh (pdf) on a return to a fixed metallic standard.
With inflation finally tamed, gold’s moment was over. Fiat currency managed by central bankers had officially won out.
Gone but not forgotten
This abandonment represents a betrayal to a few distinct, but often overlapping, groups: people who believe in limited government; people who interpret the American constitution literally; and people who fear the power of central banks, Wall Street, and other financial institutions.
Advocates of the gold standard point to the fact that because there is no way to redeem paper dollars for gold or silver, “there is no way to finally pay a debt.” One common fear is that investors will stop buying US Treasury bonds, ultimately resulting in financial ruin for the country.
“It is impossible to overstate the calamity that will occur when the Treasury bond collapses.”
Their concerns can run to the hyperbolic. “It is impossible to overstate the calamity that will occur when the Treasury bond collapses,” stresses the homepage of the Arizona-based Gold Standard Institute, a peripheral non-profit “dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge of gold.” On our current course, “we will wake up one morning and find that our bank accounts are wiped out,” it warns. “Even if we have dollar bills in our pockets, food will not last in stores for very long, because food production and distribution depends on the banking system.”
Some argue returning to the gold standard is a legal imperative.
There is a basis in the US Constitution for this, at once specific and quite vague: Sections 8 and 10 of Article I state that Congress has the “Power…to coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin,” while “no state…shall make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.”
It’s entirely possible that this was supposed to guarantee convertibility between state currencies, rather than asserting anything intrinsic to gold. But these two mentions in the country’s founding document have served as ammunition for constitutionalists, including groups such as the far-right John Birch Society, established in 1958. The society, whose views align closely with Trump’s, supports the disestablishment of the Fed and a return to the gold standard, on the grounds that the constitution does not give Congress the right to delegate its money-related powers elsewhere, nor to use any currency that is not gold- or silver-backed.
The Midas touch
But if there are various arguments for a return to the gold standard, there are many more reasons to reject it. Nearly 50 years into using fiat currency at a floating exchange rate, a total overhaul of America’s entrenched monetary policy framework is much less feasible.
For one thing, says Laidler of Western University, the rise over the past four decades of politically independent central banks has made it unnecessary. That’s because, as long-time Fed chair Alan Greenspan told Congress, “a central bank properly functioning will endeavor to, in many cases, replicate what a gold standard would itself generate.”
Plus, constraining a central bank limits how easily it can adjust monetary policy to respond to economic conditions. Between 1879 and 1914, when the US adhered to the gold standard but had no central bank, private clearinghouse associations played the “lender of last resort” role for member banks, says White, the George Mason economist. The world’s financial system is now vastly bigger, more complex, more deeply integrated, and more global than it was during the gold standard’s heyday. It’s hard to imagine how anything less than a strong, central authority could stave off, for example, the scale of market collapse that threatened the world in 2008.
The US would derive minimal benefit from re-adopting the gold standard unless other major economies did too. However, even then, the system of fixed-exchange rates created by gold convertibility has some big downsides. While encouraging cross-border investment and trade, it also makes it extremely hard for governments to adjust to localized economic disruptions (the struggles of the euro zone currency union offers a present-day example of this drawback). The gold standard could also push financial contagion to viral levels, with the flow of gold and the fixed exchange rate forcing the suffering of one nation on everyone in the system.
Gold makes a comeback
Despite the myriad reasons that a return to the gold standard seems impossible, the dream remains alive, in part because of the efforts of Ron Paul. Paul was first moved to run for office in 1976, in reaction to Nixon scrapping gold standard a few years prior. “I remember the day very clearly,” he told Texas Monthly in 2001. “Nixon closed the gold window, which meant admitting that we could no longer meet our commitments and that there would be no more backing of the dollar. After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded.”
Paul’s views were shaped in part by economist Friedrich Hayek’s accounts of how the Nazis’ effective abandonment of the gold standard allowed them to beef up fiscal spending in preparation for their war of conquest, Eichengreen wrote in National Interest in 2011. Paul subsequently spent most of his career as a vocal but lonely goldbug in Congress. He retired in 2013.
These days, Mooney, the West Virginia Congressman, has taken up the mantle as one of gold’s biggest cheerleaders (Ron Paul’s son Rand, a senator from Kentucky, is also a part of this club). For Mooney, American Eagle coins are the key to reviving the gold standard. These collectibles are issued by the US mint and sold to numismatists for about $1,600 apiece, despite having a face value of just $50—roughly the cost of an ounce of gold in the early 1970s. Some goldbugs see them as a symbol of what American money should be; the disparity between the face value of these coins and the value of the gold used to make them captures how far the dollar has fallen in their minds.
Though they are not US legal tender, state law in Utah allows them to be used as currency—though it’s an expensive way to get $50 of gas or groceries. Other state laws have mostly moved to lift taxes on them, broadly recognizing them as money rather than collectibles, on the order of baseball cards and Beanie Babies. (This taxation of money is a big beef for Mooney and his allies.)

If American Eagle coins are a symbol of how degraded US currency has become, for gold adherents, a return to the gold standard seems like the best way to protect the dollar’s value and and ensure it remains a bulwark against inflation.
It’s probably no coincidence that the most recent resurgence of gold interest has come at a time of acute public anxiety about the stability of money. The global financial system nearly blew up 10 years ago, and was saved by unprecedented monetary activism by the Federal Reserve. Nobody knew what to expect from the Fed’s epic asset purchase program. Fears of Weimar-style hyperinflation in some corners proved fertile ground for the pro-gold messages of Paul and others who see salvation in gold. Paul’s surprisingly successful grassroots presidential campaigns were further evidence that his message was gaining traction.
Hyperinflation never happened. But nor did other monetary fears recede—notably government over-reliance on debt. While on occasion president Trump has said that deficits don’t matter, the commander-in-chief credits the “very, very solid country” of yesteryear with it being based on the gold standard. In 2016, before his election, Trump suggested it might be time to stage a return: “Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do—but boy, would it be wonderful. We’d have a standard on which to base our money.” This might be dismissed as a throwaway comment, if not for Trump’s desire to put the likes of Cain, Moore, and now Shelton on the Fed board, giving a goldbug a seat at the table to steer the most powerful country’s monetary policy.

When it was announced Monday that Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and friends will be performing June 29 at Burl’s Creek in Oro-Medonte, Ont. as part of their No Filter Tour, the price of general admission was set at $119 plus service charges.
Pre-sale tickets for the Stones’ only Canadian stop on the tour were up for grabs on Wednesday. However, fans were singing “She’s So Cold” when the price of general admission was raised to $179.00.
The news befuddled fan Jim Fox, who said the price skyrocketed with a click of a button.
“I went on to buy general admission tickets. I had secured four tickets at $119.50,” Fox told the Sun. “You click yes, you want it and go to the next screen. All of a sudden the price jumped to $199 (each).”
Fox said his son tried to buy two tickets at the original price and the same thing happened.
“I was stunned to see that all of a sudden it was nearly $400 (for two tickets),” Fox said.
When added with the price of parking, seeing the Stones lives hurts the wallet.
Fox said he phoned Ticketmaster and was told the price change was a “technical error.”
In a statement, concert organizer Republic Live noted, “during a presale, a human error impacted a limited number of fans which was quickly fixed. We apologize for any inconvenience and are working directly with fans to resolve.”
The Burl’s Creek Event Grounds Facebook page also noted in a post that limited numbers of tickets were allocated at different price levels. Once one price level sold out during pre-sale, customers were “redirected to the next pricing level of tickets to complete their purchase if they wished to continue.”
When ordering tickets on Ticketmaster.ca during Friday’s public on-sale, a pop-up message warned customers ticket prices “may fluctuate, based on demand at any time” and that resale ticket prices “may exceed face value.”
On Friday, the price for general admission started at $199.50. Grandstand tickets ranged between $329.50 and over $1,000, while the pit area in front of the stage were selling for $975.80.

THE PASSENGER terminal building at the Cagayan de Oro port is expected for completion on Dec. 15, the Department of Transportation (DoTr) said.
In a statement on Sunday, DoTr said the construction of the terminal, which is the biggest in the country is now in full swing.
“This modern two-storey terminal building houses passenger port facilities which include check-in areas equipped with x-ray scanning machines, walk-through metal detectors, restrooms, charging stations, pay parking, ticketing offices, and field offices for Port and Tourist police,” it added.
When the terminal opens, DoTr said it expects to be used by 3,000 passengers every day.
In June 2016, the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) issued the Notice to Proceed for the construction of the terminal. According to the PPA website, the construction company in charge is Jejor’s Construction Corp.
PPA posted a decline in net profit for the first quarter due to dredging costs. In a statement in May, it said net profit fell 4% year on year to P2.259 billion.




“Dredging as well as repair and maintenance costs comprise almost our entire expenses for the period, all aimed at making our ports efficient and more responsive to the demands of the times,” PPA General Manager Jay Daniel R. Santiago said in the statement.
Mr. Santiago said the PPA hopes to hit its net profit target of P16.18 billion by year’s end with the completion of certain infrastructure projects, including the Cagayan de Oro terminal.
“Once completed, these projects will definitely boost our revenue and eventually our income all anchored on faster turnaround of vessels and cargo in our ports,” Mr. Santiago was quoted as saying. — Denise A. Valdez

Let’s just say I’ve got California firefighters on my mind.
Throughout the state, they’re doing heroic work to keep the loss of life and property to a minimum in a mind-boggling busy summer for wildfires. (Note: One of the blazes, the Holy Fire, started fairly close to my home!)
So, wondering what the job market looks like for firefighters, I tossed a detailed annual study of workers and wages by federal job counters into my trusty spreadsheet. Here’s what the latest report — using data as of May 2017 — tells us about statewide employment levels and compensation for workers classified as firefighters and how California stacks up nationally.

PG&E rebates: only for the Oct. 9 power shutoffs 1. How many? 31,150 California workers are classified as firefighters, the most of any state in the nation. This is not surprising considering California’s our most populous state. Roughly 1-in-10 of the nation’s 319,860 firefighters are in California. Following the Golden State: Texas (27,900), Florida (24,430), Ohio (18,670) and Illinois (17,830).
2. Is that really a lot? Not really. Based on employment levels across all industries, California ranked 32nd in ’17 for firefighting’s share of all jobs in a state. Or, looking at this another way: California has 17 percent fewer firefighters than the average workforce. North Carolina has the highest firefighter-to-all-workers ratio, with 58 percent more than the national average.
3. Good pay? California firefighters averaged $73,860 annually in ’17 vs. $51,930 nationally and No. 2 in the U.S. behind’s New Jersey’s $75,880. Following California is New York ($70,560), Washington ($70,300) and Nevada ($66,670). Lowest paid? Mississippi at $30,690.
4. Pay range? California’s best-paid firefighters (90th percentile) got $112,250 a year in 2017. Lowest paid (10th percentile) got $39,960. That gap is 17th highest among the states, with California’s high-paid firefighters making 2.8 times the bottom.
5. Who else makes that much? Look at California’s all-industry pay rankings, and you’ll find in 2017 that firefighters’ average wages are wedged between commercial and industrial designers, compensation analysis specialists, makeup artists for theatrics and middle school teachers.
6. Growth? California firefighting staffing expanded 17.3 percent between 2012 and 2017 — that’s No. 13 among the states and more than double the 7.7 percent national growth. Average wages grew 1.8 percent in 2012-17 — that’s No. 43 among the states — and well below 8.1 percent raises nationwide.
7. And local? In Southern California’s metro area in 2017 there were 7,660 firefighters employed by various agencies in Los Angeles County (average pay of $85,620); 1,050 in Orange County ($81,190); and 2,480 in the Inland Empire ($66,150).

Megan Rapinoe considers Sunday to be the final insult.
Just a few hours after the United States and the Netherlands meet in the Women’s World Cup final in France, Brazil or Peru will celebrate winning the Copa America, South America’s men’s championship. And then at night, the United States or Mexico will win the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the men’s title of North and Central America and the Caribbean.
A TV triple of championships for some is yet another slight for others.
“It’s ridiculous, and disappointing, to be honest,” said Rapinoe, the star American midfielder.
FIFA said playing the three finals on the same day would boost attention for all
“The scheduling of the different events has gone through a comprehensive consultancy process, which has involved all key stakeholders and taken into account different aspects of the women’s and men’s international match calendars,” the governing body said in a statement. “It is a rare and exciting occurrence.”
CONCACAF President Victor Montagliani told The New York Times, however, the decision to schedule the Gold Cup final for Sunday was not deliberate and was due to a “clerical error.”
“It’s terrible,” said former American midfielder Aly Wagner, now Fox’s lead World Cup match analyst. “It is so disturbing to me that the Women’s World Cup does not have its own day to stand on its own and have a final to highlight these tremendous athletes and their work and their accomplishment. They wouldn’t dream of doing it to the men. Why would they do it to the women?”
FIFA announced the Women’s World Cup dates at the emblem launch on Sept. 18, 2017 , then revealed the full schedule the following Feb. 9.
CONCACAF did not announce the expansion of the Gold Cup from 12 teams to 16 until Feb. 26, 2018, then said last Sept. 27 that the final would be held at Chicago’s Soldier Field on July 7. South America’s governing body made the Copa America dates known since at least early 2018 and said last Dec. 18 the final would kick off at 4 p.m. EDT.
The Women’s World Cup final will start at 11 a.m. EDT on Fox, followed by the Copa America final at 4 p.m. EDT on ESPN+ and the CONCACAF final at 9:15 p.m. EDT on FS1. Telemundo, a sister network of NBC, has Women’s World Cup and Copa America Spanish-language U.S. rights, while Univision has the Gold Cup.
“I really am a believer in the rising tide lifts all ships,” said David Neal, executive producer of Fox’s World Cup coverage. “Because of the timing of them, it’s probably not going to hurt anybody.”
Advertisers don’t seem to think the three finals will cannibalize each other.
“It doesn’t alter in any way shape or form what we plan to do. I’m not sure whether it’ll splinter viewership or not,” said Chris Curtin, chief brand and innovation marketing officer of Visa, one of six FIFA partners.
Advertisers focus on their product’s marketing and activation and pretty much ignore the other tournaments.
“The priority for Coca-Cola is the FIFA Women’s World Cup and we’re going to do everything we can to bring a lot of attention, a lot people in front of TVs, to watch the game, to watch the final,” said Ricardo Fort, head of global sponsorships at The Coca-Cola Co., another FIFA partner. “Too bad for the other finals. I’m pretty sure the Women’s World Cup final is going to be a big global event again.”
For the U.S. women’s team, vocal advocates for gender equity, the three finals are just another in a long parade of putdowns that include lower prize money and arrangements inferior to those provided for the men.
“I don’t really understand why there’s such a resistance against going all-in on women,” Rapinoe said. “I think it’s pretty clear women in sport have not been treated with the same care and financing and all of that that men’s sports has.”

Infraestructura Energética Nova (IEnova) chairman Carlos Ruiz Sacristan and Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) CEO Manuel Bartlett have agreed to jointly work toward re-opening a section of IEnova’s Sonora natural gas pipeline in Western Mexico that has been inactive since August 2017, Ruiz Sacristan said Thursday.
CFE is Mexico’s state-owned power utility and the anchor customer of the Sonora pipeline, which includes the 503-kilometer (313-mile) Sásabe-Guaymas and 328-kilometer (204-mile) Guaymas-El Oro segments. The Guaymas-El Oro segment remains shut amid a still-unresolved legal dispute with one of the area’s eight Yaqui indigenous communities. The other seven gave their blessing to the pipeline, which entered operation in 2017, but was subsequently sabotaged that same year by the dissenting Yaqui faction.
IEnova is the Mexican unit of U.S.-based Sempra Energy.
During IEnova’s fourth quarter earnings call Thursday, Ruiz Sacristan told analysts that he and Bartlett had a “very cordial discussion about [Guaymas-El Oro]. We agreed with CFE that our priority is to work together to place this pipeline back into service.”
Bartlett and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called earlier this month for the renegotiation of several of CFE’s natural gas pipeline contracts, citing “unfair” take-or-pay clauses that force CFE to make fixed capacity payments to developers for delayed or inactive pipelines such as Guaymas-El Oro.
At the time, Bartlett cited IEnova, TransCanada Corp., and billionaire Carlos Slim’s Grupo Carso as firms whose portfolios include delayed or inactive natural gas pipelines commissioned by CFE.
Since then, however, Bartlett has held meetings with executives of each company to discuss a path forward for their stalled projects.
“I think this is really a great opportunity to solve [the Guaymas-El Oro] problem and put that pipeline into place,” Ruiz Sacristan continued, adding, “There was no discussion whatsoever of what future contracts would look like.”
The expected in-service date of another delayed project, the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan marine pipeline, has been pushed to April 2019, IEnova CFO Nelly Molina said. In its previous earnings call, IEnova had forecast a startup date of late 4Q2018 or early 1Q2019.
Estimated capital expenditure (capex) for the project, which is a joint-venture with TransCanada, has risen to $2.48 billion from $2.36 billion, Molina said, citing that the cost overruns and delay are mainly due to unfavorable weather conditions that have impeded the final tie-ins of the pipe’s offshore section.
IEnova said it expects to reach a final investment decision (FID) in late 2019 for the Energía Costa Azul (ECA) natural gas liquefaction terminal on the Pacific coast.
The company is targeting potential first Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) deliveries in 2023 for the project’s first phase, which is expected to produce approximately 2.4 million tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG.
IEnova and Sempra LNG & Midstream signed three heads of agreement (HOAs) over the last year with affiliates of Total S.A., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., for the full capacity of ECA’s first phase. Each firm will potentially purchase 0.8 Mtpa, IEnova said.
IEnova reported a profit of $89 million (6 cents/share) for the fourth quarter, up from $37 million (2 cents) in the year-ago period.
The company attributed the increase to improved results at the Termoeléctrica de Mexicali (TDM) thermal power plant, the acquisition of Ductos y Energéticos del Norte (DEN), and higher margins in the gas segment.
Full-year profit totaled $431 million (28 cents) in 2018, up from $354 million (23 cents) in 2017.

If you want to spend your retirement in year-round warmth with the backdrop of rain forests or beaches, the Philippines may be your ideal option. The cost of living in the Philippines dips significantly lower than it does in the U.S., and the government takes steps to make it especially welcoming to expats. But there are some pitfalls you’d want to avoid. This article provides an in-depth guide to what it’s like to retire in the Philippines. We’ll cover topics like costs, taxes, access to healthcare and safety. We can also help you find a financial advisor to guide you through the process of strategizing your retirement abroad.
Cost of Living in The Philippines
If you’re finding it hard to stretch your dollar in the U.S., you might want to consider the the Philippines for your golden years. Numbeo, a major database of economic conditions in different countries, reports that the cost of living in the Philippines is significantly lower than it is in the U.S. How much lower? Below, we compare the Philippines and the U.S. in terms of specific costs.
Rent Prices: 79.16% lower than in the U.S.
Consumer prices with rent: 59.19% lower than in U.S.
Restaurant meal prices 71.48% lower than in U.S
Grocery prices: 50.24% lower than in U.S.
Local Purchasing Power: 76.94% lower than in U.S
International Living, a magazine that extensively covers the costs of residing in different countries, reports that most expats can live comfortably with $800 to $1,200 a month. That includes housing and going out to enjoy what the Philippines has to offer.
Getting Your Visa in the Philippines
To retire in the Philippines with a valid visa, you may have to jump through a few hoops. But we’ll walk you through the process step by step.
First, you need to obtain a variety of the Special Resident Retiree’s Visa (SRRV). Its most attractive option is the classic option. To qualify for one, you have to meet the following requirements:
Be at least 50-years-old.
Deposit at least $10,000 into a Philippines bank if you have guaranteed monthly income ($20,000 otherwise). This covers you and two dependents.
Deposit $15,000 for each additional dependent.
Have proof of pension that pays at least $8,000 a month ($1,000 for couples).
The good news is that “pension” can refer to most sources of retirement income including Social Security benefits.
The one-time visa application fee is $1,400 for the head of household, plus $300 for each additional family member. You also have to pay an annual fee of $360 to renew it. This fee covers you, your spouse and one child. You also have to pay $100 for each additional child if you have any.
In addition to your visa, you must obtain an Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR-I) card with a microchip containing bio-metric data. It also contains your fingerprints. This card serves as your re-entry permit along with your valid passport with a visa stamp. It costs $50, and you must renew it each year.
Retiree Housing in the Philippines
retiring in the philippines More
Securing housing as a retiree expat in the Philippines would take some strategy. If you have an SRRV visa, you can purchase a condo or townhouse. However, you can’t buy a fully detached home. The good news is you can use the $10,000 deposit for the visa to purchase one of these homes if your overall investment in the country is at least $50,000. So you may want to rent until you can purchase your own home.
That said, it’s important to research a potential location with laser focus. Some areas in the Philippines lack sufficient infrastructure. This means power outages and water stoppages can become the norm in some places. You’re also going to want to have easy access to healthcare, banks and entertainment.
Access to Healthcare in the Philippines
Obtaining healthcare may be a challenge in the Philippines depending on where you stay. If you live in the capital, Manila, it’s very easy to get access to healthcare. However, other areas lack sufficient healthcare facilities. This can pose a serious issue for those with chronic conditions or expats who require frequent medical attention.
But if you have easy access to hospitals, healthcare costs significantly lower than it does in the U.S. and you can easily sign up for a local health insurance plan. You can also apply for the government healthcare program PhilHealth. Unfortunately, however, hospitals in the Philippines don’t accept traditional Medicare. Plus, many hospitals require payment at the point of service.

Image This is money that UFT members would have earned had they received 4% raises in 2009 and 2010. Because you have a union that fights for you, eligible UFT-represented employees are entitled to be compensated for the two 4 percent raises that former Mayor Michael Bloomberg gave to members of some municipal unions in 2009 and 2010 but refused to give to public school educators and other city employees at the time.
When Bill de Blasio became mayor, he agreed to pay the money owed but said the city could not afford to pay it all at one time, so the UFT negotiated a contract that ensures UFT-represented employees will be made whole by 2020.
In accordance with that 2014 contract, UFT-represented employees currently on payroll who worked for the Department of Education between 2009 and 2018 (or a portion of that period) will receive a lump-sum payment in October of 25 percent of the amount they accrued between those years. That payment, which will be added to a regularly scheduled paycheck, is the third of five lump-sum payments between 2015 and 2020. (UFT-represented employees received the first payment of 12.5 percent of money owed in 2015 and the second payment of 12.5 percent of the money owed in 2017.)
Think of it as a bank account. If you have been continually employed, you have been depositing money in this account since Nov. 1, 2009. This October, you‘ll make your third withdrawal.
Teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors and all other UFT titles on the Q Bank payroll will receive their third lump-sum payment as part of their Oct. 15 paycheck. Q Bank retirees will be paid on a supplement payroll on Oct. 20.
For therapists, school nurses, supervisors of nurses and therapists, educational officers and analysts, and other UFT titles on the H Bank payroll, the money will be in the Oct. 19 paycheck. H Bank retirees will be paid on a supplement payroll on Oct. 19.
If you are on paid parental leave for the October payment and return to work by the last day of February in 2019, you will get your lump-sum payment on March 15, 2019, instead. If you return to work after the last day of February, you will receive both your missed payment and the next lump-sum payment in October 2019, provided you are back on payroll by then.
If you are on another form of leave this October, you will receive your money on the date of the next scheduled lump-sum payment that you are back on payroll.
This October’s lump-sum payment comes on the heels of a 5 percent rate increase that all UFT-represented DOE employees received in May and June in accordance with the 2014 contract.
The DOE had not released the dates for per-session lump-sum payments by the time the newspaper went to press.
If you have questions about your lump-sum payment, you may file a Lump-Sum Inquiry Form.

Milan’s public transport company ATM has introduced fast-track payment turnstiles for the city’s metro, allowing passengers to pay using a contactless credit card. “This is another step towards a more technological city”, according to ATM chairman Luca Bianchi, that should make queues at ticket machines or the tobacconist a thing of the past. The metro can now be accessed at any station on the city and suburban network by simply waving a card using the EMV standard near the reader provided, which checks its validity. Turnstiles equipped with the technology are recognizable by their orange colour and will also be used to tag the card when leaving the metro. All of the city’s 113 stations are equipped for the new payment method. “We have 250 operational turnstiles,” said Arrigo Giana, ATM’s general manager, “and by the end of the year this number will rise to 500”. The system is also able to calculate the cheapest fare. If a passenger uses the metro four or more times within a 24-hour period, for example, their card is charged €4.50 for a daily pass instead of €6 for four single tickets. Passengers can also consult a list of their journeys after registering their user profile on the ATM website.

Moreover, passengers can simply show their credit cards to ticket inspectors, who check them on a PDA “Milan is aiming for increasingly efficient public transport in order to be a competitive city”, commented Marco Granelli, the city councillor in charge of transport. This technology is being used in fewer than ten cities in the world, including London, Vancouver and Singapore. The experiment does have some limitations, however. For example, it is currently not possible to pay for multiple journeys together, meaning you cannot pay for yourself and a friend at the same time. The journey must start on the metro, although it may be continued on overground transport for the journey duration envisaged by a normal ticket (90 minutes). Passengers can use a smartphone or smartwatch with credit card authorization, but have to remember to swipe the same device when entering and leaving the metro station. If a passenger forgets to swipe out when leaving, the maximum fare for a journey beginning at the station of entry will be charged. The project, realized in collaboration with Mastercard, Visa and with the technical support of Aitek, Intesa Sanpaolo, Microsoft and Sia, is already set to expand. “With 5G technology we can also include buses and trams in the network,” said Giana. That means extending the use of contactless payments to the entire ATM fleet, although we will have to be a little patient: completion of this digital revolution will take at least another year and a half.

Giana is looking to the future, and a system that establishes the cheapest fare based on the amount of journeys on public transport a passenger completes in a week, month or year. “However, to make this possible,” the general manager explained, “we need approval for long-term data retention from the Data Protection Authority”. According to Granelli, the innovative system will make life easier for users when Milan’s current transport management system is withdrawn, probably in 2019. In the space of three years, the company plans to overturn the ratio of printed tickets paid for in cash (currently accounting for 80%) and those based on digital transactions (20% percent, in the form of tickets purchased using apps or text messages). The new system aims to make travelling around the city easier for both tourists and city residents. “We want to reduce the number of private cars in circulation,” continued Giana, “and increase the use of local, environmentally friendly, public transport”.

CLOSE Tax season is upon us and no matter what tax bracket you fall under, there is no escaping Uncle Sam. Susana Victoria Perez has more Buzz60
Story Highlights
Arizona lawmakers narrowly approved changes Thursday that will prevent a $195 million tax hike on individual income-tax filers this year, sending the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey, who has said he wants state tax revenues to go up.
The Senate and House voted along party lines for a Republican measure that will "conform" Arizona's tax code to the changes ushered in by President Donald Trump while ensuring Arizonans don't pay higher state taxes as a result.
Democrats opposed the measure and encouraged changes that would increase state taxes and use the money for the rainy-day fund, education or transportation.
"Cutting our income-tax rates does not help relieve the burden those in the lowest brackets are carrying," said Rep. Mitzi Epstein, D-Phoenix.
Federal cuts could raise state taxes
While the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced federal taxes for most people, they could have indirectly increased state taxes for Arizonans, which is the issue lawmakers were trying to address.
The federal changes reduced several deductions, meaning people report more taxable income. But because federal tax rates also were reduced, individuals pay less in federal taxes because of the changes.

Arizona usually conforms to federal tax changes. But in this case, if the state adopted all the changes in how taxable income is calculated, but didn't reduce tax rates, people would pay about $195 million more to the state, according to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.
The committee estimates businesses would pay about $40 million less to the state by conforming but not changing the rate.
Combined, that would result in what the Joint Legislative Budget Committee estimates to be a $155 million tax increase for the state, and Ducey wants the state to see that cash.
"The governor has been clear — we need to conform and any additional revenue should be put in the rainy day fund," Ducey’s office said in a statement to The Arizona Republic earlier this week.
Republicans don't want tax hike
Republicans in the Legislature don’t want to raise state income taxes on individuals by conforming without somehow offsetting that impact, however.
Their measure conforms to the federal changes, but reduces the tax rate so that even though the starting line on state tax forms includes more taxable income, people won’t pay more to the state.
The measure would accomplish this by lowering tax rates across the board by 0.11 percentage points.
That would reduce state tax collections by about $157 million, about $2 million more than the $155 million increase the state would see by conforming and not lowering the tax rate.
Lawmakers could not reduce tax collections by precisely $155 million without adding a third decimal place to tax rates.
READ MORE: You may pay more in taxes in 2019 – here's why
The Senate vote on the measure was 16-13 with Republican Kate Brophy McGee of Phoenix the only member of her party to oppose the measure. The bill passed the House 31-29, along party lines.
"We have the opportunity now to make sure we are not taking what the federal tax code put back in the pocket of taxpayers," said Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley.
He noted the state budget already is forecast to have a more than $1 billion surplus in the next fiscal year.
"At what point do we have enough?" Finchem said. "At what point do we trust the taxypayers again? I trust my taxpayers."
Rep. Regina Cobb, R-Kingman, said conforming while reducing the state tax rate to keep state revenues even was the responsible thing to do.
"This is not a tax cut," Cobb said. "This is an offset. If we don't do this, it is a tax increase."
The state Department of Revenue will not move forward with any changes in tax forms until the issue is settled by lawmakers and the governor.
"We will wait for a decision by the governor," Revenue Department spokesman Ed Greenberg said.
People who already filed their 2018 taxes will not need to file an amended return, according to the Department of Revenue.
If the measure is signed into law, anyone who has filed a return already or who does so before the changes become law will get an automatic refund for any amount they overpaid because of the subsequent change to lower their tax rate by 0.11 percentage points.

Manila (CNN Philippines Life) — It's 3 a.m. in Caloocan City when 30-year-old Arvin Doloque, drags himself out of bed.
Careful not to wake his four-year-old daughter, he's out of the house by 4:30 a.m. and en route to San Roque Elementary School in Navotas, where he teaches third grade math.
He experienced a graveyard shift at the call center where he worked for nine years, but he still considers himself nocturnal.
“Oo, tamad ka na ... pero on my part, naisip ko na lang: Naku, ‘pag hindi ako pumasok, paano nalang ‘yung estudyante ko?” says Doloque. “'Yung estudyante ko nga, gusto nilang pumasok.”
He clocks in for his first class at 6 a.m., just about the time that Dax Macaraya gets up in her Marikina apartment and gets ready for her afternoon classes. She handles a second grade class in Malanday Elementary School, teaching all subjects from noon until 5:30 p.m.

Before that, Macaraya is scheduled to teach at the morning session of an ICT training program for the faculty. The project is meant to be sustainable by the time she leaves next year. Until then, there’s lots of work to do.
Half past 7 a.m., Niki Baroy gets up and sweeps up her house in a relocation site in Cagayan de Oro City. Residents of the area lost their homes to Typhoon Sendong in 2011. She prepares for her first class before lunch over coffee.
Baroy has had to live without water for more than half a year. She never thought having a faucet would be a luxury.
“These challenges I’ve faced for the past seven months were the same challenges the Macapaya community endured for the past five years,” says Baroy.
Doloque, Macaraya, and Baroy are only three of over 90 teaching fellows at Teach for the Philippines, an organization that deploys young professionals into the education sector.
“[Teaching] requires you to have an enlarged heart to accommodate 41 of your children every day ... [and] the issues that they have at home. You're also accommodating ... the community that made them that way,” says Dax Macaraya. Photo by JILSON TIU
But they are part of a larger force now: they are part of hundreds of thousands of public school teachers from Basco to Jolo, getting up and getting out and clocking in at six, seven, eight o'clock in the morning to the ringing of school bells.

Bing Gerona arrives in Muntinlupa Science High School by 7 a.m. The science coordinator has been awake for almost three hours, having prepared her baon for the day and meals for her two siblings. At 55, Gerona is the family breadwinner; her mother just passed away, her brother does not have regular work, and her sister is recovering from breast cancer.
The cats pawing at her laboratory window greet her. As she fumbles with the key, a cat that looks like it survived a bad accident brushes against her leg. She jokes, “I'm the catwoman of MunSci.”
Gerona has been teaching here for 15 years. Apart from managing teachers, she handles a few classes in science investigatory research. She says the fulfillment from teaching is intangible.
“How do you describe [it]? It’s different when you are working or dealing with non-living things. These are living things, you can see them grow,” she says.
“[Of] the ₱19,000 that I usually take home, I do not have savings. Daan lang sa kamay ko, eh,” says Bing Gerona, a science coordinator at Muntinlupa Science High School. “My salary is not enough.” Photo by JILSON TIU
When Gerona settles down for an interview with her colleague, Faculty Club President and prefect of discipline Romeo Lacanlale, both talk about how teaching has made them surrogate parents.
Lacanlale also refers to himself as 'loco parenti' —“Ako ang tatay nila dito.”
Gerona agrees. She might never have married, but she does not mind when her students call her “Ma'am” repeatedly, blending it into “Mama” by mistake. “I don't get offended when they [call me] 'nanay ...' because that's how I treat [my students].”
But while their students appreciate them, Lacanlale and Gerona said they don't feel the government does.
“[Of] the ₱19,000 that I usually take home, I do not have savings. Daan lang sa kamay ko, eh,” says Gerona. “My salary is not enough.”
Lacanlale has taught in both public and private schools since 1983, but he is still a “Teacher I.” Following 2018 Budget Department records, he earns between ₱20,000 to ₱22,000 monthly.
But subtract his dues, he says, and the loan he is paying off for his two daughters' college education, and his take home pay is only ₱7,000. It’s an improvement from the ₱3,000 he was left with before income taxes were lowered, he says.
Lacanlale says he survived while supporting his family because of the “London bridge.”
He laughs, explaining, “When we speak of London as a teacher, we mean 'loan dito, loan doon.’”

“I’m not an exception to that,” Tina Villareal echoing her fellow colleague’s need to take loans. “We really need an increase in salary.”
Villareal is a cluster head at Parañaque Science High School. She shares this just before noon, after having done her rounds checking classrooms in the morning.

Over 29 years of teaching, she has acquired loans for the education of four children, as well as her house — which she is still paying off, long after her children have graduated and moved out.
“Out ‘yung savings. ‘Yun ang wala. Sufficient lang siya,” Villareal says of her salary.
“Kung may pinag-aaral [ka], it will be very difficult ... Tapos nagkakasakit ‘yung bata, dapat talaga meron kang naitatabi kahit papaano,” she says. “Eh kung wala kang i-se-save kasi sufficient nga lang ‘yung nare-receive mong salary for your daily needs, paano na? Dinaanan ko lahat iyon.”
Villareal has another grievance: the cost of required training seminars for teachers. Certificates from these seminars are necessary for complying with the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program and maintaining their license as a teacher. The seminars also have to be authorized by the Professional Regulation Commission.
Free seminars provided by the Department of Education’s Division Offices are just “not sufficient” for all teachers, says Villareal.
“‘Yung iba … they opt to pay for these seminars that they have to attend,” she says, adding some trainings can cost up to ₱6,000.
Romeo Lacanlale echoes this; in his experience, seminars cost ₱1,000 to ₱2,000 — still a large chunk of his ₱3,000 take home pay last year.
On top of these required expenses are expenses out of moral obligation, particularly when teachers see their students need help in project contributions or transportation going home.

Before the feeding program was instituted, Villareal recalls having to feed a whole class during first period. She'd pack eggs, hotdog, rice — whatever would help them think straight during lectures.
“Some of them worked after school. Nagtitinda ng balut, nag-iigib ng tubig, nagtitinda ng sigarilyo ... Wala silang attention or time to study at home,” says Villareal.
She did not have to do it — but she did, because she couldn’t feed their minds until their stomachs were satiated.

Rosie Conde teaches teachers every Saturday at Philippine Normal University, the country's designated National Center for Teacher Education. Aspiring and professional teachers from all over the country study here in hopes of earning their license or gaining the points needed for a promotion.
“One thing that is very evident at my 7 a.m. class [is] ... some of them are sleepy,” she says. “I understand they were traveling, like [at] 1 a.m., just to come here. It will take [some of] them ... about seven to eight hours just to come into university.”
Some of her students, she says, come from as far as Batangas, Pampanga, and Pangasinan.
Conde herself spent 16 years teaching in Caraga State University in Butuan; after earning her PhD, she moved to Manila, where she believes she could make a greater impact.
In particular, Conde instructs teachers how to teach math. Specializing in didactics of mathematics, she is on a mission to make the application of math to daily life more evident to students.
“Usually there is a gap between mathematics and the real world ... we're into abstract things like what x [or y] stands for,” Conde explains.
“I think mathematics should be a human activity ... It's more [about] realizing what should be done in the society using mathematics as a tool,” she adds.

Different options for college, for example, could be mathematically weighed out through pros and cons. What she passes on in theory to her students, they pass on in application — so that for students in primary schools, math can have meaning.
Like a true math teacher, Conde considers her work important because of its “multiplicity effect.” She handles about 15 students in each of her two Saturday classes, and each of her own students handle about 30 to 40 students per class on weekdays.
“When you teach quality education ... teachers also can teach the quality education that students deserve,” she says.

Tina Bawagan has been teaching in Philippine Science High School since 1986. It had been five years when she was released from a month-long detainment in a military safehouse.
It is the early afternoon, and she has just finished her classes when the history teacher recalls: She had been a little over 20 when she went underground to counter martial law, and married a man from the movement not long after.
“By evening, that's when they started the torture ... ‘yung mga interrogation, pananakit,” Bawagan recalls. “By today's definition, it would be called rape, what they did to me. That was until the next morning.”
She did not flinch when sharing her story, as if she had recounted it hundreds of times.
“Being a teacher is so much like being an activist ... in the classroom, you are able to impart values and principles among students,” says Tina Bawagan, a teacher at Philippine Science High School since 1986. Photo by JL JAVIER
They asked for her name the next morning. She assumed her mother had called; her late father, who died when she was four, had been a naval officer. After that, the torture stopped.
Bawagan was released in June 1981, at the age of 27. Her first stint was teaching in a private all-girls Catholic school. In December, she got word that her husband — whom she had not seen or heard from since her release — was killed.
“But I continued — I was still active in the teachers' movement here. Nagpatuloy ako,” says Bawagan.
“Being a teacher is so much like being an activist ... in the classroom, you are able to impart values and principles among students,” she adds.
Today, Bawagan has two children from a second marriage. She teaches four sections in ninth grade and chairs a committee on environmental awareness and waste management.
Her most fulfilling moment as a teacher came after the controversial burial of Ferdinand Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani in 2016 — particularly because of how her students responded. They took to the streets, joining a protest at Bantayog ng mga Bayani.
“Sabi ko ... 'I'm ready to retire,'” Bawagan recalls. “We used to be talking about martial law and how rights were not respected at the time. It was all academic then ... but now you're here, and you're marching.”

Tina Bawagan points out a discrepancy in the salary raise for civilian government personnel. Although she has a higher pay owing to her senior status in a school run by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), she says less fortunate colleagues — particularly those under Department of Education (DepEd), or those in a lower teaching level — are at a disadvantage.
Teachers in the public school system start as a Teacher I, progressing to II, and later III; each of the three levels has eight steps. Teachers can then progress to Head Teachers (with six levels), Master Teachers (four levels), or Principals (four levels).
A Teacher I earns a Salary Grade of 11 — between ₱20,179 and ₱22,055 — depending on which step they are in. This is a new figure, following the third tranche of government personnel raises that took effect on January 1 this year.
The amount is less than ₱1,000 more than what a Teacher I earned in 2017, when Salary Grade 11 was pegged at a range of ₱19,620 to ₱21,307. It is a bit more than ₱1,500 up from the pay in 2012, which started at ₱18,549.
In contrast, a Principal IV or Master Teacher IV under DepEd has a salary grade of 21 and earns between ₱52,554 and ₱58,322. The amount is ₱13,061 more than what they earned in 2012 — around eight times more than the raise given to a Teacher I.

A Special Science Teacher V in Philippine Science High School earns even higher —with a salary grade of up to 24. That’s between ₱73,299 and ₱81,344, and almost ₱10,000 up from what they earned only last year.
However, it is teachers on the lower rungs who are expected to spend the most in order to be promoted. A Teacher I must go through eight steps at each level before becoming a Teacher II and III, and before moving up as a Head Teacher, Master Teacher, or Principal.
Steps — and therefore, promotions — are determined through an elaborate point system where teachers gain points by attending training seminars, authoring textbooks, taking masteral units, or winning awards, among other activities.
For most teachers, training seminars and graduate studies require out of pocket payment, and a raise of not even ₱2,000 since 2012 may make it difficult for them to succeed.
“I don't know what the formula is, but I don't think it's fair for those who get less,” says Bawagan.
Despite 35 years of teaching, six years of which were spent in Muntinlupa Science, Romeo Lacanlale is still a Teacher I. His colleague Celine Calado, who has been teaching there for 17 years, only got promoted this school year.

“For 16 years, Teacher I ako ... May mga nagsabi, 'Kasi hindi ka nag-aral.' Hindi ba talaga ako nag-aral?” Calado says. “Sinupport ko na ang programa ng DepEd.”
Calado signed onto DepEd's foreign language program. Although she teaches Japanese, her field of specialization does not have any equivalent points that lead to a promotion. She says in her point of view, she won’t get far until she completes graduate studies — which is worth 10 points.
“Sana, sa akin lang, sa kabuuan ng gobyerno ... sana huwag sukatin, huwag timbangin ang guro sa 45 units,” says Calado.
She sighs and confesses, “Kung hindi ba magbabago ang ganoong sistema ng pagtingin sa guro, hindi ko alam kung bakit pa ako mag-stay.”
CNN Philippines reached out to Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno for comment on teachers’ salaries, but he has yet to respond.
In January, the secretary came under fire for saying that doubling teachers’ pay in 2019 was not a national priority. Diokno has since clarified that he supports a raise in 2020, but doubling their salary would require an additional ₱343.7 billion — and that would entail a downgraded credit rating, or possibly raising taxes.

While public school teachers voiced their support for projects such as health and feeding programs, they enumerated other ways they could be supported.
Financial literacy. Apart from a salary raise, Macaraya pointed out it would be beneficial for teachers if they were taught to manage their wealth. Conde agreed, saying it would help given tightly knit Filipino culture, "where we don't have just one [family] to feed.”
Support for science schools. As Villareal says Parañaque Science needs a set collection of books teachers can use as references, Muntinlupa Science High School needs more support for laboratory tools and equipment. Gerona adds her school struggles with a research fund; DepEd Memorandum 143 reiterated the no collection policy from public school Parent-Teacher Associations, forcing her to turn to alumni for donations that will allow students to pursue science projects or compete in tournaments.
ICT support. Although some public schools have already adopted technology, Baroy had to raise funds for a flat screen television for Grades 5 to 6 in her school in Cagayan de Oro. Despite shortages in electricity, her colleagues are itching for ICT training. “I've seen some of my co-teachers struggle with technology ... [but] that never stopped them from wanting to learn more,” says Baroy. “They would often tell me, 'Ma'am, naghihintay lang talaga kami pero ready na kami.'”

When Tina Bawagan was in first grade, she would pretend to be a teacher. She aspired to wear the heels that her teachers wore, although she would never use a pair in her years in the profession.
I ask her what she would have been if she was not a teacher. Suddenly Bawagan recalls how she once visited a government researcher who moonlighted as a psychic.
The psychic told her she had 17 past lives. Her very first was in Lemuria, a legendary continent that was supposedly “co-existent with Atlantis, if you believe in that.”
“[She said,] 'Guess what you were doing in Lemuria? You were a teacher,'” Bawagan laughs. “Ha? Hindi na ako nagsawa?”
Most of the teachers we spoke to, Bawagan included, said that teaching was not only a job — but a vocation. When they do not call it a vocation, they say it was work they were meant to do.
“Siguro may mga iba't ibang definition tayo [sa pagiging] mayaman. Sa akin is, makapagtanim lang ako ng maganda or mahawakan ko lang sila sa pagtuturo ko — iyon na ‘yung kayamanan na masasabi ko,” says Arvin Doloque of how teaching has fulfilled his life. Photo by JILSON TIU
Arvin Doloque had worked for almost a decade in a stable call center job when he finally decided to take the leap. It meant sitting down his parents and thanking them for putting him through college, but also saying that he had delivered — and now he had to do something for himself, and for other people who, like him, were raised in the public school education system.
“Siguro may mga iba't ibang definition tayo [sa pagiging] mayaman. Sa akin is, makapagtanim lang ako ng maganda or mahawakan ko lang sila sa pagtuturo ko — iyon na ‘yung kayamanan na masasabi ko,” says Doloque. “Hindi man siya tangible na parang pera na mahahawakan mo, [pero] ‘yung intangible na mababaon mo all throughout your career... na dumaan sila sa akin.”
But teaching also calls out not only to those who persevere, but to those who are patient. Niki Baroy says her time with Teach for the Philippines taught her that teaching is delayed gratification.
“'Yung paghihirap mo bilang teacher ngayon, sa dulo mo pa talaga makikita ang bunga,” she says, “at sana 'yun ay ang pagtatagumpay ng mga estudyante mo.”
Cristina Villareal recalls a student who called out to her as she was on a jeep. The boy, who had sold cigarettes along Sucat, would grow up to become a Dubai-based engineer.
When I ask Villareal what about this profession fulfills her, she begins to cry.

“I'm [hoping] my students will become future members of the scientific community,” she says, adding a lot of her students have gone on to work in geology, energy, or medicine. “Fulfilled ka talaga ‘pag nakita mo.”
Rosie Conde has a similar story of a student who drove a tricycle to scrape a living, but later topped the engineering board exams.
“When you teach, you won't only be teaching mathematics. You will be teaching and transforming those students to become better,” she says.
Dax Macaraya says something similar: Teaching requires “The best of you as an individual.”
“It requires you to have an enlarged heart to accommodate 41 of your children every day ... [and] the issues that they have at home. You're also accommodating ... the community that made them that way,” she says.
“Kahit na umalis na ako dito sa Malanday, I will still speak of the teaching profession as very prestigious,” Macaraya continues. “I would probably ask friends that I know that are good at what they do to really dip their toes in the public school education system.”

The school bell rings. Twelve hours since she left the house, Bing Gerona makes her way home at around 6 p.m. The eldest of three siblings, she is the family breadwinner.
“The joke is, when I go home I usually bring or buy bread [for] my sister and brother,” she says. So she does.
Her sister is recovering from cancer. Their mother has just died, and they are sorting out the legal work that comes with a death in the family. Gerona washes the dishes, cleans the kitchen, then finally she can start checking homework.
“Kung sinasabi nga ni Dr. Jose Rizal na nasa kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan, sinasabi ko naman: Nasa guro ang pag-asa ng kabataan,” says Romeo Lacanlale. Photo by JILSON TIU
Her colleague Romeo Lacanlale goes home to a wife who is also a public school teacher. They mark papers together.
One of his daughters now manages a restaurant; the other works on a tourist ship. The loan that put them through college was a great investment, even as he is still paying for it. They offered to support him and his wife through early retirement, but Lacanlale turned it down.
“Para daw mag-enjoy naman daw kami sa life namin ... Pero ang sabi ko, ano ang gagawin ko after that?” says Lacanlale. “Mananatili pa rin kaming teacher hanggang 65. Kapag destined ka sa posisiyong iyon, mahirap umalis.”
He looks forward to knowing the school bell will ring the next morning. He still has plenty of students to meet, plenty of dreams to help fulfill, and plenty still to learn.
Shifting in his seat, he says, “Kung sinasabi nga ni Dr. Jose Rizal na nasa kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan, sinasabi ko naman: Nasa guro ang pag-asa ng kabataan.”

Story 91
It acts on behalf of consumers and can win back money they've lost during a dispute with their estate agent.
But the Property Ombudsman's average compensation may not be as much as aggrieved homeowners had been holding out for.
Head of the Property Ombudsman Katrine Sporle says: 'A serious case would be £1,000 compensation but it could go higher than that.
'But normally it would be £100 to £200 compensation plus any money that is lost.'
Average compensation from The Property Ombudsman is between £100 to £200 compensation, plus a payout covering the money that is lost
In addition to compensation, the Property Ombudsman also gives awards for financial loss as a direct result of an agent's action.
In an exclusive interview with MailOnline Property's, Mrs Sporle claimed that £1.3million was paid out in money lost by consumers last year.
With around '4,000 complex cases' last year, the award to cover money lost equates to around £325 per payout on average based on open cases. This figure increases if the average is based on the number of closed cases, reaching £532 for sales and £625 for lettings.
While not be sniffed at, a few hundred quid is perhaps not the redress that many consumers are hoping for if they feel they had lost out on thousands of pounds due to what they felt was a error by their estate or lettings agent.
And the time spent sending dozens of emails back and forth and filling out complaint forms mean that it could be less than worth your while financially raising the issue with the Property Ombudsman.
So why should you?
The Property Ombudsman said £1.3million was paid out in money lost by consumers last year
With 90 officers and 50 adjudicators at the Property Ombudsman, Mrs Sporle claims it applies what is 'fair and reasonable' and 'puts consumers back to where they were before they lost out, plus compensation'.
'We aim for an early resolution,' she insists.
Official figures show four awards of more than £9,999 against estate agents last year and nine against letting agents.
In addition there were five awards of between £4,999 and £9,999 on the sales side and 21 on the lettings side last year.
The Property Ombudsman received 23,841 enquiries in 2017. However, it could be argued that there is a flaw.
The Property Ombudsman is funded through fees from its members - the very people that consumers are complaining about: lettings and estate agents.
However, Mrs Sporle insisted decisions are always independent.
She said: 'The Property Ombudsman Service provides fair, free and independent advice to protect consumers against poor behaviour from agents and to put things right when things go wrong.
'We were set up 27 years ago when it was recognised that consumers needed a place to go when they had exhausted an organisation's internal complaint's process, but wanted an alternative to avoid the expense and time taken by going to court.'
She added: 'We are funded by the industry but our decision making is absolutely independent and we always base our decision on the evidence that is provided to us by both parties.
'Our role is much broader than only putting things right when things go wrong; more importantly we work closely with the industry to raise standards to try and avoid the problems arising for consumers in the first place.'

ORO Wealth, a young Mumbai-based bootstrapped startup operating out of Powai, is a 10-member team which includes four of its co-founders. Even though it’s a small office, the dynamic energy levels and excitement is visible.
This excitement has risen a notch higher ever since it began to be recognised at various industry forums, media interviews and startup contests. ORO Wealth won the first round of the Startup Challenge powered by Dell, which saw more than 500 early stage startups applying for the contest. The contest is a platform for entrepreneurs to bring their potential business ideas to market and an opportunity for early stage startups to present their business ideas in a supportive yet competitive environment and get greater exposure.
ORO Wealth was selected as the winner of the first round of the Startups Challenge by a jury comprising Ritu Gupta, Director – Marketing, Consumer & Small Business, Dell India; Sahil Kini, Principal, Aspada Investments and Madanmohan Rao, Director – Research, YourStory.
Congratulations to the winners!
The third round of the contest is on! If you are an early stage startup, apply for the Startup Challenge powered by Dell.
According to Ritu Gupta, “In the Startup Challenge we are looking for business ideas that are innovative, have a clear vision for business growth, future potential, social impact and have the capacity to be a game changer in the industry. At Dell, we believe that the startups of today will be the growth engines of tomorrow’s economy and the source of future job opportunities.”
Nitin Agrawal, Vijay Kuppa, Yogesh Powar, and, Swati Aggarwal, the four co-founders, share the story of ORO Wealth and why they are starting to make headlines in the Indian financial sector.
Talking about developments in the Indian financial sector, Nitin says, “Wealth in India is growing, yet penetration of financial products remains very low. For instance, Mutual Funds AUM (Assets Under Management) in India is 7% of GDP as compared to a global average of 37%. A key reason is that financial advisory is largely offline limiting its reach beyond Tier 1 cities. Offline advice also leads to non-uniformity of experience – some advisers may be good, many are not. Also, the industry is mainly commission-based which often leads to mis-selling. Technology is also not leveraged enough to make the entire experience of investing easy for the customer.”
These are some of the focus areas that ORO Wealth is aiming to address. Through its web and mobile-based wealth management platform, ORO Wealth enables retail investors and offline intermediaries to access high quality advice and investment services. Nitin says, “By building online, automated tools which can provide high-quality, unbiased advice uniformly at low costs, we are enabling deeper penetration of financial products.” But ORO Wealth’s claim to fame is that they are India's first zero-commission investment platform. What this means is that retail investors can come to ORO and transact in direct mutual funds plans.
A key factor that is enabling the startup achieve its stated objectives is technology. Nitin says, “Technology is an integral element of our offering. It is only through technology that we are able to solve the twin problems of poor distribution economics and lack of standardisation plaguing the investment products industry. While we have a great product , technology makes our solution scalable and enables us to take it to investors even in smaller cities. Further, the intuitive technology that is being used at the front-end of our product, is making people – who so far have been used to just face-to-face interactions – comfortable with the idea of making investments online.
Nitin has worked at Deutsche Bank in Equity Structuring in their London and Singapore offices. In his role at Deutsche Bank, he designed and sold several billion-dollar investment solutions to some of the biggest global investors. So we ask Nitin why is a zero commission model an interesting value proposition for retail investors and how does it fit in ORO Wealth’s monetisation roadmap.
His response is, “Not paying commissions translates into higher returns for end investors and helps them avoid the biased advice that often comes from commission-based sellers.” He adds, “Instead, they can use a small part of the commissions they have saved to buy ORO's advisory tools and experience the difference that truly low cost investing and unbiased advice can make to their returns.”
ORO Wealth’s monetisation strategy can be derived from its transactions platform plus value-added services – where investors can come and transact in (purchase, redeem, switch) zero commission (direct) funds from multiple AMCs (Asset Management Companies) in one place. Its various value-added services such as fund screener and portfolio tracking are available to users of the transactions platform, which they can use for free. The second part of its monetisation strategy is its ORO advisory services. ORO currently offers mutual fund advisory services and is planning to launch stock advisory services soon. Investors can pay for these advisory tools on a pay-as-you go basis. Nitin says, “All of these tools suggest only direct funds and the fees are a fraction of what you save in commissions. So the advisory is actually self-paying.”
Nitin explains that they are also taking these tools to retail investors by partnering with existing financial intermediaries who already have an established client base. This has helped them to lower their customer acquisition costs and also scale quickly.
Founding ORO Wealth
The founding team, Nitin, Vijay, Swati, and Yogesh, come with an institutional investing background. When they looked at making investments, they saw a huge difference in the way retail investing works. Vijay says, “The kind of conversation that our relationship managers had with us, the way our friends and relatives were investing, made us realise that there was an opportunity which was sort of untapped.” Swati says they really wanted to get the basics right with minimum hassle for the end investor – unbiased evaluation of investments, building a diversified portfolio and ensuring that we lose as little as possible to fees and commissions. This, was just an idea in December 2014. The next few months saw the co-founders working on the idea of ORO Wealth, and they finally launched the startup a year later in January 2016.
And, in a span of just eight months ORO Wealth has received over 2,500 registrations, without any marketing spend. Vijay says, “So far, our key focus has been on developing the product. Now since we have laid a strong foundation, we are actively looking to raise funds to further accelerate product development and spread investor awareness about our product”.
Talking about how ORO’s offerings have continued to evolve since its beginnings, Vijay says, “At ORO, we believe that it is best to listen to the customers. Initially we started as a transaction platform in direct mutual funds for DIY investors but a lot of people wanted to take advisory services. So then we launched an automated advisory tool.” It was customer feedback, based on which ORO began building a portfolio health analyser and also the stock advisory offering.
Making investing in direct funds easy
The ORO Wealth team believes that they are currently the best platform available for buying direct funds. Nitin says, “If you compare ORO versus AMCs, RTAs, and any other free ways of accessing direct Mutual Funds, you will see how ORO offers several advantages. ORO offers users access to 25 AMCS which together account for more than 90% of industry AUM. Also, AMC websites and RTA apps offer limited coverage – on AMC websites, investors can only buy funds from that AMC. RTAs allow investors to buy direct mutual funds from those AMCs which are serviced by them. But given that the large AMCs are nearly evenly divided between them, an investor would need to have accounts with both of them. While, Mutual Funds Utilities (MFUs) allows you to buy direct fund from all the 25 AMCs but it is mainly a platform for distributors and lacks several features which are important for retail investors.”
The other factors that make ORO an ideal option for consideration are: dedicated customer care that ensures that the retail investors’ paperwork and transactions go through smoothly even without the commissions; its value-added services like portfolio tracking, fund screener and ORO advisory, among others. But the key value proposition remains “ORO’s no-strings attached pricing. Investors can transact on ORO (and enjoy our other services) by just paying a small, one-time convenience fee. There are no annual subscriptions, no running fees and absolutely no obligation to buy our wealth management services,” explains Nitin.
Challenges, entrepreneurial journey and the excitement
So what are some of the biggest challenges that a startup like ORO Wealth is facing?
And, the answer, according to the co-founders, is “low awareness among investors.” Yogesh explains, “Many regular fund platforms market themselves as ‘free’ which they are not by any stretch of imagination. The key for us is to raise awareness which we are doing on an ongoing basis through various investor awareness workshops. SEBI regulations which will make it mandatory for mutual fund houses to disclose commissions to the end investors will become effective from October 2016 and should give a big boost to our efforts.”
In addition, ORO Wealth also faces some of the same problems faced by other financial product providers in India, the co-founders say. This includes making people understand the importance of investing and building trust for a new platform. To address these hurdles, the team believes that content marketing and education will play a pivotal role.
Yogesh says, “Apart from the business-specific challenges related to ORO Wealth, entrepreneurship brings challenges of its own. Despite the growing acceptance of entrepreneurship, leaving the safety of a monthly pay check is still a big deal.” Nitin adds, “Also, when you work in a large corporate everything is structured. From that to the unstructured word of a startup is liberating but also intimidating.”
A big reason why they applied for the Startup Challenge powered by Dell is because it offered “greater exposure both in front of investors and in front of our potential customers,” says Swati. “Winning has once again validated that we are doing something right. We hope this early success will be a stepping stone for us to achieve more,” she adds.
Apart from the excitement of the win, ORO Wealth is also brimming with energy because of a partnership with two large financial institutions which the startup will announce shortly. Nitin says, “This will boost our growth further, especially with respect to customer acquisition.”

Ieri i primi indizi, con l’apparizione su “Mappe” di Apple dell’indicazione “Accetta Apple Pay” quando si selezionano gli esercizi convenzionati, oggi la conferma: Apple Pay in mattinata sarà attivo in Italia. Dopo svariate settimane dall’annuncio, necessarie per mettere a punto una macchina che dev’essere sicurissima e perfettamente oliata, il sistema di pagamento cashless di Apple potrà essere usato anche nel nostro Paese dai possessori di iPhone (iPhone 6, 6S, SE, 7), Watch, iPad (iPad 2017, Air 2, Mini 3 e 4, i due iPad Pro) o di un MacBook di ultima generazione con TouchID. Nel caso di iPad o MacBook si potranno pagare ovviamente solo gli acquisti fatti sul web, app o prodotti sui siti che lo accettano al momento circa dieci.
Registrare una carta di credito è decisamente semplice, basta andare nell’app Wallet di iOS, tuttavia in questo momento l’app per alcuni utenti ancora non accetta le registrazioni delle carte, probabilmente verrà sbloccato tutto nel corso della mattina. In ogni caso non saranno moltissimi gli utenti che fin da oggi potranno registrare la propria carta di credito per usare Apple Pay: oltre al device infatti servirà una carta emessa da Unicredit o da Banca Carrefour oppure Boon, anche lui attivo da oggi in Italia.
Il pagamento è sicuro e rispetta la privacy: non solo sui server Apple non viene inviato alcun dato legato alla quantità o al tipo di acquisti, ma la chiave di protezione è generata in modo univoco dal chip di sicurezza dell’iPhone, quindi risiede fisicamente sul dispositivo stesso. Se viene rubato serve comunque l’impronta digitale, e l’utente può disabilitare subito Apple Pay nel menu di gestione dell’account iCloud.
Per pagare è semplicissimo: basta appoggiare sul POS l’iPhone e premere il TouchID per l'autenticazione e la conferma, molto più sicuro del PIN della carta di credito. Nel caso del Watch non serve il TouchID: si presuppone che l’utente lo abbia addosso e non lo abbia mai tolto dal polso, perché una volta tolto il Watch chiede il pin per potersi attivare.
Apple Pay funziona con tutti i POS contactless, il 50% circa dei dispositivi installati in Italia: non necessariamente deve essere esposto il logo Apple Pay.
