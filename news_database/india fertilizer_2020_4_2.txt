            "content": "New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will lose about Rs 4,000 crore in revenue and start making cash losses after the government slashed the natural gas prices by a steep 26 percent by benchmarking it against rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations.\n\nPrices of natural gas, which is used to produce fertilizer, generate electricity and gets converted into CNG for use in automobiles and piped natural gas for household cooking, was from 1 April cut to $2.39 per million British thermal unit - a rate about 37 percent lower than the cost of production.\n\n\"These rates are unsustainable for us. We have already told the government that the gas pricing should be freed. There should be complete pricing and marketing freedom,\" ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker told PTI here.\n\nThe BJP-led government had in October 2014 evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like the US, Canada, and Russia to determine the price in a net importing country. Prices using this formula are calculated semi-annually.\n\nOil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on 20 March, 2017, had stated that the cost of production of natural gas in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is between $4.99 -7.30 per mmBtu. The same for other basins is in the range of $3.80 -6.59 per mmBtu, he had said.\n\nFor ONGC, which produces most of its 64 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from western offshore, the breakeven is around $3.8.\n\n\"The rates are now way below cost,\" Shanker said.\n\nFor every $1 dollar change, the company's revenues are impacted by Rs 4,400-4,500 crore annually.\n\nOn 1 April, the gas price was reduced from $3.23 per mmBtu to $2.39 - an 84 cent reduction which translates into annual Rs 4,000 crore of revenue loss.\n\nAnother company official explained that gas makes up for roughly half of the company's bottomline and if the business makes losses, the company may soon start generating cash losses.\n\nThe reduction on 1 April was the second in six months and took rates to the lowest since the new pricing formula came into being in 2014.\n\nThe price of gas produced from difficult fields such as deepsea too has been cut to $5.61 from $8.43 per mmBtu. This would just about breakeven ONGC''s new production from KG Basin.\n\nThe government had in October 2014 adopted a formula that takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK), Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months -- on 1 April and 1 October each year.\n\nThis formula was adopted soon after the expiry of the $4.2 per mmBtu rate fixed for Reliance''s KG-D6 gas for five years.\n\nThe rates at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till they touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period. Subsequently, they rose to $3.69 in April 2019 to September 2019 before being cut by 12.5 percent in October 2019 to $3.23.\n\nSources said the government realised that the pricing arrived at using the formula was way too low to make the production of gas from difficult fields such as deepsea viable.\n\nSo the government in April 2016, gave a ceiling for the gas from such fields. The ceiling in April 2016 was $6.61 which rose to $9.32 in April 2019 before being cut to $8.43 in October and now to $5.61. But this applies only for future gas production and existing deepsea finds get the lower $2.39 price.\n\nONGC is India''s largest integrated oil and gas company, accounting for 75 percent of crude oil and natural gas production by volume, and 17 percent of domestic refining capacity.\n\nFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.

            "content": "Shares of city gas distribution companies rallied up to 10 per cent intra-day on the BSE on Wednesday after the government cut the domestic natural gas price for the April-September period to $2.39 per million British thermal unit (mBtu).\n\nAmong individual stocks, surged 10 per cent to Rs 427.70 and gained 6.04 per cent to Rs 246.65. was up 5.5 per cent while Mahanagar Gas and GAIL India were both up over 2 per cent each in an otherwise weak market. In comparison, the S&P BSE Sensex was down 3.5 per cent at 12:14 PM.\n\nThe new price for domestic natural gas is the lowest in six years since the Narendra Modi government introduced the new pricing formula in November 2014.\n\nThe rate for gas produced from difficult fields will be $5.61 mBtu on gross calorific value basis. This ceiling price will be applicable for deepwater, ultra-deepwater, and high pressure-high temperature areas, including the under-development fields of Reliance Industries in KG-D6 block in Eastern Offshore.\n\nTthe price of the majority of natural gas produced in the country, including by companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India, will be down 26 per cent to $2.39 a unit from $3.23 a unit for the October 2019 to March 2020 period, according to a notification by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).\n\nConsequently, shares of Oil India and ONGC slipped on the development with the two falling 5.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\nBesides the drop in prices, the current lockdown is likely to make business difficult for these companies with less demand. According to a report by Emkay, the current lockdown has led to a 15-20 per cent hit on demand due to the closure of most factories in sectors, excluding fertilizer, power and refineries. GAIL may see a 15-20 million standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd) decline in marketing volumes as the lockdown progresses, while transmission volumes may fall up to 10-15mmscmd, the report said."

            "content": "Amid the white noise of COVID-19 pandemic coverage last week, news about the $80 million funding round for alternative protein company Nature’s Fynd offered a bright beacon of positivity. While the financing revelation was delayed a week because of the crisis, the sizeable round extends the steady growth of funding for this particular niche of the overall agtech space.\n\nAlmost $20 billion flowed into food-related agtech during 2019, according to the latest AgFunder report published in late February — that covers everything from farm robotics to e-grocers to alternative foods. One of the most fertile categories within this big menu is agricultural biotechnology, particularly alternatives for plant and animal health — everything from non-chemical fertilizers to gene-based pesticides to biome-enhancing livestock feed and other nutrient approaches for both flora and fauna (and fish, too!)\n\nIndeed, according to separate research published this week by venture investment and development firm TechAccel, investments in plant and animal biotech doubled from 2017 to $6.9 billion at the end of last year.\n\n\"If you look at the size and scope of agriculture globally, it’s still extremely ripe for disruption,\" Mike Rohlfsen, vice president of business development for TechAccel, told me last week.\n\nRohlfsen and I actually chatted in early March about the state of ag biotech, but we reconnected for a sanity check late last week given the economic turmoil brought on by coronavirus. As you might expect, he expects a disruption in the pace of deals — at least for the short term. A more immediate concern, though, is how research and development could be interrupted.\n\n\"If the universities shut down, well, guess what? You’re not going to have the ability to do the test that you thought you were going to do or things are just on hold,\" he said. \"We’re also going to start to bump up against crop cycles too.\"\n\nThat’s because the sorts of projects TechAccel is funding get developed in labs and greenhouses and tested, quite literally, in the field. As the growing season approaches in the United States, some startups might be forced to find alternative locations for trials.\n\nShutterstock Hargol ToodTech, an Israeli company, is researching ways to turn grasshoppers into food for livestock and companion animals.\n\nRegardless of any temporary pause, Rohlfsen believes that consumer interest in what’s in the food they’re eating coupled with the drive to remove \"synthetics\" from the food system will continue to inspire investments. One area of particular note for me: animal biotech, where TechAccel reports a 15 percent increase in startups from 2017 to 2019, many focused on making animal feed more sustainable or on better approaches to aquaculture.\n\nHere are just seven examples of new players in this space that emerged over the past two years:\n\nFYTO — a Boston-based MIT spinout working on plant-based feed production and on an automated feed distribution system; its pitch centers on producing animal feed with less water, fertilizer, land and energy.\n\n— a Boston-based MIT spinout working on plant-based feed production and on an automated feed distribution system; its pitch centers on producing animal feed with less water, fertilizer, land and energy.
