            "content": "The EU's top court ruled on Thursday (2 April) that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic broke EU law by refusing to take in their share of asylum seekers in 2015.\n\n\"By refusing to comply with the temporary mechanism for the relocation of applicants for international protection, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have failed to fulfil their obligations under European Union law,\" the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ) said.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nIt also found Poland and the Czech Republic at fault for failing to fulfil an earlier decision by the council of member states with regard to some 40,000 migrants.\n\nThe court said that in refusing to comply, the three member states had no right to cite 'maintaining law' or 'safeguarding internal security', or claim that the relocation programme was 'dysfunctional'.\n\nHungary's justice minister Judit Varga tweeted that the \"EU compulsory relocation system of migrants is dead and today's CJEU judgement won't change that. It must be lonesome in the saddle since the horse died.\"\n\nNow, it is up to the EU Commission if it wants to follow up the court ruling.\n\nThe commission could determine that the original 2015 council decision can still be implemented and launch a second infringement procedure for financial penalties.\n\nAll of those commission considerations would be subject to scrutiny by the court.\n\n'Original sin'\n\nIn 2015, during the influx of migrants to Europe, member states decided to distribute people among EU member states.\n\nThe decision was taken by home affairs ministers - where Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were outvoted by other member states.\n\nWarsaw, under a different government, agreed with the 2015 decision.\n\n(The commission has removed the webpage on the relocation figures.)\n\nBut commission figures from last October say that in total, 34,712 people were relocated from Italy (12,713) and Greece (21,999) under the scheme, with a lower number of people eligible, due partly to a slowing of the influx, than previously expected.\n\nHungary did not take any asylum seekers, the Czech Republic took in only 12. Poland took none. Slovakia eventual offered temporary shelter to more than 1,200 people who filed for asylum in neighbouring Austria, so was not sued by the commission.\n\nHungary and Slovakia challenged the decision of the ministers in court, arguing that the ministers' vote was contrary to an earlier commitment by EU leaders.\n\nIn 2017, however, the ECJ ruled that the relocation quotas were legal.\n\nIn 2015, 120,000 asylum seekers were supposed to be shared among member states, relocating 50,400 asylum seekers from Greece and 15,600 from Italy.\n\nOriginally, the commission offered Hungary the option to relocate 54,000 people from the central European country, but prime minister Viktor Orban refused.\n\nSome diplomats from the rebel EU countries refer to the quota vote as an \"original sin\" that broke trust between the commission and eastern and central European governments.\n\nIt also fuelled years of campaigning by Orban domestically against both the EU and migration.\n\nThe bitter rift over migration and especially relocation quotas has been driving a wedge between member states ever since.\n\nThe commission in 2016 unveiled new proposals to reform the EU's asylum system - but its permanent mechanism to relocate migrants in a possible new massive influx was fiercely rejected by Hungary and Poland.\n\nThe commission earlier this year binned its effortsto reform the Dublin asylum system based on that proposal and is working on new ones."

            "content": "Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, one of the worst hit cities from coronavirus, has called on the Italian government to speed up the issuing of the yearly decree that regularises non-EU migrant workers, as Italy is in desperate need for agricultural workers before the harvest season begins.\n\nEvery year, Italy regularise selected migrant workers through the so-called Decreto Flussi (literally ‘flows-decree’) which set the quota of non-EU citizens allowed to enter the country to work.\n\nThe decree is issued by the Interior Ministry concomitantly with the start of harvest time. Last year the quota was set at 30,850 workers, of which 18,000 were earmarked for seasonal work.\n\nWhen Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-migrant party Lega, was Interior Minister in 2019, the publication of Decreto Flussi was delayed until the end of April, causing anger among farmers.\n\n“This year, a lot of regular migrant workers will not come to Italian farms. We need at least 200,000 non-EU workers and we need that the decree is released immediately,” said Gori on his Twitter account.\n\nBergamo, which has become infamous for the military vehicles carrying hundreds of coffins away from the city, has 2,060 confirmed deaths from coronavirus. However, according to an estimate carried out by the local daily L’Eco di Bergamo using data provided by local municipalities, the real death toll was rather of 4,500 victims in the last month for the whole province.\n\nCriticism from Gori’s proposal of 200,000 non-EU workers come from Lega. “It is incredible that in the midst of an epochal emergency like the one we are experiencing, there is still someone who, instead of thinking of protecting the work of Italian people, makes appeals for the formulation of a flow-decree for non-EU citizens,” said MEP Marco Zanni, group leader of far-right group Identity and Democracy (ID) at the European Parliament.\n\nCOVID-19 measures could cause ‘devastating’ labour shortage in EU farming Europe’s farming sector could face a dramatic shortfall in workers as a consequence of the border restrictions put in place to stem the spread of novel coronavirus, which could lead to “devastating” impacts, according to Pekka Pesonen, secretary-general or farmers association COPA-COGECA.\n\nA major issue\n\nAccording to Italy’s farmers’ organisation Coldiretti, more than 25% of the food produced in Italy relies on the hands of over 370,000 regular seasonal workers coming from abroad every year.\n\nRomanians make up the lion’s share, with a community of more than 105,000 agricultural seasonal labourers working on Italian farms.\n\nThis year the agricultural workforce is lacking either because foreign labourers are blocked in their countries of origin or feel that coming to Italy would pose health risks.\n\nWith just one week to go before the picking of strawberries, the issue becomes more complicated. Asparagus, cauliflowers and zucchini also need to be picked in the coming weeks.\n\nParticularly concerned are the agri-food businesses in Veneto region, where according to the local trade union Fai Cisl Veneto, at least 65,000 farm labourers are needed to ensure a minimum level of harvest.\n\nLast year 79,000 seasonal workers were hired in that area and three out of five were foreigners, coming mostly from Eastern Europe. Only 850 were non-EU citizens coming to Italy through the yearly decree.\n\n“If we do not collect today, we will lose a total of 100,000 jobs as the entire food supply will come to a standstill, Fai Cisl’s Andrea Zanin told Il Corriere del Veneto.\n\nHe added that the situation created the paradox that the entire agricultural supply chain is exempted by the restrictive measures taken by Italy’s government to contain the epidemic, but that a lack of personnel will frustrate the ongoing efforts.\n\nConfagricoltura, another farmers’ organisation representing the interests of bigger agricultural entrepreneurs, made a request to both agriculture minister Teresa Bellanova and labour minister Nunzia Catalfo to send jobless and people receiving unemployment benefits to the fields.\n\nIn particular, they referred to the unemployed receiving the so-called universal citizens’ income, a flagship measure of ruling party Five Star Movement.\n\nThe grant consists of a minimum subsidy of €780 a month, a figure closer to unemployment benefit than to a real basic income.\n\n[Edited by Benjamin Fox]"

            "content": "A common buzzword at the beginning of the century, the hydrogen economy could finally be about to materialise on the back of falling technology costs and growing interest from policymakers, according to a global industry outlook by research firm BloombergNEF.\n\nUp to 34% of global greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and industry could be cut “at manageable cost” thanks to clean hydrogen produced from renewable electricity, says the study, published on Monday (30 March).\n\n“The falling cost of making hydrogen from wind and solar power offers a promising route to cutting emissions” in hard-to-abate sectors such as steelmaking, transport and chemicals, according to BNEF’s ‘Hydrogen Economy Outlook’.\n\n“However, this will only be possible if policies are put in place to help scale up technology and drive down costs,” the report adds.\n\nRenewable hydrogen could be produced for $0.8 to $1.6/kg in most parts of the world before 2050, the report said, adding this would make the clean fuel competitive with current natural gas prices in countries like Brazil, China, India, Germany and Scandinavia.\n\nWhen including the cost of storage and pipeline infrastructure, the delivered cost of renewable hydrogen in China, India and Western Europe could fall to around $2/kg in 2030 and $1/kg in 2050, the report said.\n\nCrucially, this would make clean hydrogen production from renewable electricity cheaper than producing it from natural gas, which is currently the main process of generating the fuel.\n\nAround 70 million tonnes of hydrogen are currently being used globally, mostly for oil refining and chemical production, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nBut getting clean hydrogen produced in sufficient quantities and at reasonable costs to decarbonise the economy will require a determined push by policymakers, according to the outlook by BloombergNEF.\n\n“The clean hydrogen industry is currently tiny and costs are high. There is big potential for costs to fall, but the use of hydrogen needs to be scaled up and a network of supply infrastructure created,” said Kobad Bhavnagri, head of industrial decarbonisation for BNEF and lead author of the report.\n\n“This needs policy coordination across government, frameworks for private investment, and the roll-out of around $150 billion of subsidies over the next decade,” he added.\n\nDutch urge swift EU hydrogen push to cut industry, transport emissions The European Commission should create an EU-wide market for hydrogen “as soon as possible” rather than wait for renewable energy-based varieties to be commercially available, a top Dutch ministerial envoy has said.\n\nGlobal hydrogen coalition\n\nAccording to policy analysts, mobilising such a huge amount of subsidies will require an EU-wide framework, or even a global coalition for scaling up green hydrogen in order to avoid the risk of free-riding.\n\n“If every country waits for green hydrogen to become cheaper someday, this will considerably delay decarbonisation specifically in hard-to-abate sectors like industry and aviation,” said Matthias Deutsch, a senior associate at German think tank Agora Energiewende.\n\nIndeed, some countries might find it attractive to avoid shouldering the innovation costs associated with early hydrogen deployment by simply waiting for other countries to pay the higher bill, he wrote in a recent opinion piece for EURACTIV.\n\nWhat he recommended is to mandate a quota for green hydrogen in gas production at EU level, and gradually raise the target it in order to scale up production.\n\n“Economic recovery efforts in the context of the European Green Deal provide a unique opportunity to make a coordinated down-payment on the clean hydrogen economy, with all of the ensuing benefits for European job creation, economic growth and industrial competitiveness,” Deutsch said.\n\nEurope is currently at the forefront of a global push to deliver hydrogen at scale, with most projects currently happening on the old continent, according to the IEA.\n\nAt EU level, the European Commission is planning to launch an EU-wide “clean hydrogen alliance” in the summer, bringing together EU member states and companies involved in the hydrogen value chain.\n\nThe initiative will be modelled on the European Battery Alliance, which brought together more than 200 companies, national governments and research organisations around battery manufacturing.\n\nEU announces 'Clean Hydrogen Alliance' for launch in the summer Plans for an EU-wide hydrogen alliance were confirmed on Tuesday (10 March) when the European Commission unveiled its new industrial strategy.\n\n“Massive amounts” of renewables needed\n\nHowever, producing hydrogen at scale will be a huge challenge, BNEF warned.\n\nMeeting 24% of energy demand with hydrogen – and keeping with the 1.5C warming scenario of the Paris Agreement – “will require massive amounts of additional renewable electricity generation,” the report said.\n\n“In this scenario, around 31,320 TWh of electricity would be needed to power electrolysers – more than is currently produced worldwide from all sources,” the report said.\n\nAdd to that the additional renewables that are required to decarbonise the power sector, and the figures become dizzying.\n\n“Total renewable generation excluding hydro would need to top 60,000 TWh, compared to under 3,000 TWh today,” the report points out.\n\nResearcher: 100% renewable energy requires ‘a lot of green hydrogen’ The production of so-called green hydrogen from wind and solar electricity is seen as a potential game-changer for the transition to a 100% renewable energy system. But getting there will take some time and some intermediary solutions will be needed, says Daan Peters.\n\nHydrogen imports\n\nThis also means many countries would have to import hydrogen from abroad in order to cover their needs.\n\n“China, much of Europe, Japan, Korea and South East Asia may not have enough suitable land to generate the renewable power required,” the report points out, echoing similar findings by BDI, the German industry association.\n\nIn Germany, one of the scenarios BDI identified for 2050 points to “an import demand of 340 terawatt hours (TW/h)” of hydrogen, said Carsten Rolle, executive director at the World Energy Council Germany, and head of energy and climate policy at BDI, the German industry association.\n\nThis, he told EURACTIV last year, “is broadly speaking equivalent to the capacity of the complete German power plant fleet in order to produce hydrogen or others efuels abroad for Germany”.\n\nGerman industry eyes massive imports of ‘solar fuels’ from Australia Huge amounts of synthetic fuels generated from renewable energies will be required to fully decarbonise the German economy, according to industry association BDI, which eyes yearly imports of 340 terawatt hours (TW/h) by 2050 – the equivalent of Germany’s entire power fleet.\n\nCarbon capture and storage\n\nScalability and land availability issues could be partly addressed by producing hydrogen from other sources than renewables, such as natural gas.\n\nAlthough more expensive, hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) “may still need to play a significant role, particularly in countries like China and Germany that could be short on land for renewables but are well-endowed with gas and coal,” the report said.\n\nOil and gas producers agree. “What we know for sure is that we can’t afford to be picky: all clean hydrogen sources are needed to get to the scale we need,” said François-Régis Mouton, Europe director the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP).\n\n“We can already start by gradually expanding and decarbonising today’s hydrogen production – 2/3rds of which comes from gas – by combining it with CCS,” Mouton said.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]"

            "content": "Credit Karma, Canva, and Grab.* What do these companies have in common? All of these companies have either female CEOs or co-founders, and all are valued at well over $1 billion dollars. Coincidence? I tend to think not.\n\nData has actually proven that gender-inclusive founding teams have greater success in both fundraising and innovation. There is a fantastic study conducted by the Kauffman Fellows Research Center that finds that female-founded companies not only raise more capital than all-male teams, but also provide better returns. Founders also tend to hire people culturally similar to themselves; so a more diverse leadership team inevitably creates a more diverse culture overall.\n\nBut there is another important factor to consider: the composition of the board. Board members have quite a bit of influence when it comes to the direction and strategy of the company.\n\n500 Startups Retreat Gathering 500Startups\n\n\n\n\n\nDiverse Boards: Times are changing\n\nSo what drives a significant increase in the diversity of boards? I believe that there are two factors at play; government policy and the leadership within the company.\n\n1. Policy\n\nIn the United States, 20.9% of the top 3,000 companies (Q3 2019) have women on their board, and we have seen it increasing quarter over quarter. In Europe, one reported number is slightly better, at 26.7% (Q4 2018).\n\nWhat we see helps to move the needle is countries with mandatory quotas. The percentage of women on boards shoots up to 37.5%, when there are policies in place that require women on boards. (See figure below.) Given that these policy shifts drive tangible outcomes, there are even talks about setting an EU-wide quota for having women on boards.\n\nEuropean Institute for Gender Equality European Institute for Gender Equality\n\nAnother great example of this is California which became the first state to legally compel corporate board diversity, by requiring that all public companies have at least one woman on their board by the end of 2019. By the end of 2020 the law ramps up, requiring companies with five board members to have at least two women, and three female directors for boards of six people. If companies fail to comply, they face a one time fine of $100,000, and if they continue to break the law, face a fine of up to $300,000 for every seat that should be filled by a woman.\n\n2. Leadership\n\nIn addition to policy, where we are able to see additional success in bringing more female board members is through strong corporate leadership. Executives who set clear gender equality goals generate a culture that runs top down. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs CEO David Salomon announced that they will no longer take companies public both in the United States and Europe if they don’t have at least one “diverse” member on their board of directors, with a priority and focus on women. By 2021, the bank will look for two diverse board members. While these numbers are just a start towards equal representation, it’s initiatives like this that are key to shifting mindsets and creating new norms. Goldman Sachs is not the first one to claim this; in 2017, Blackrock first made the plea to increase diversity on boards.\n\nBeyond policy and leadership, how can we help close this gap? Despite these new policies, we need to fill a significant gap in terms of how can women can actually get a board seat. I know many successful women who have both the desire and experience to be a director on the board, but they ultimately don’t know where to begin. If there was a playbook for this, I’d be the first to share it. But since there isn’t, here are three tips from women who’ve been there.\n\n1. Set the intention and don’t be afraid to say it out loud\n\n“It’s not uncommon for women to downplay a desire for something like obtaining a seat on the board of a public company, says Shannon Gordon, CEO of theBoardlist. “It's important for women to articulate their ambitions and then critical to have a network of mentors and sponsors in place to provide support and introductions necessary to land that first board role”. TheBoardlist is an online talent marketplace that connects CEOs who are looking for qualified board director candidates with women who are peer-endorsed for both private and public company board service. The founder, Sukhider Singh Cassidy, who is a board member at TripAdvisor, StubHub and Ericsson, initially founded theBoardlist to help women with many of the challenges that she faced in her early days, and then later recruited Shannon to drive the company’s growth forward.\n\nA similar sentiment was shared by Claudia Sender, former CEO of LATAM Airlines which is the largest airline group in Latin America. She now sits on the board of Telefonica, LafargeHolcim, Gerdau, Estácio and was Fortune 40 under 40 in 2013. “Being vocal that you want a board position to a relevant and expanded network is the first step” she recommends.\n\n2. Build an incredible network\n\n“Around 90% of board members come from recommendations within a network, which makes it hard to expand to a diverse pool”, says Gordon. This statement is not surprising to me because the same is true for venture; people always look within their network and pipeline for investment. Being Chinese-Brazilian and initially an outsider in Silicon Valley, I was eventually able to join the club of venture capitalists, but I couldn’t have done it without the network that I had built over the years. I know how important it is to help bridge access to new networks, and it’s something I’m now trying to accomplish in both my personal and professional life.\n\n“I founded theBoardlist to debunk the ‘pipeline problem’ myth”, mentioned Cassidy, “We don't have a pipeline problem - we have an access problem. Most boards look for their next director within their own network which is, by definition, limited and homogenous. I wanted to use technology to bring transparency and access to the vast community of board-ready women.”\n\n3. Get ready and embrace your expertise\n\n“One of the most common questions I get is ‘am I ready?’”, says Gordon. “Historically, people look at CEO or CFO profiles, but there is now a need for a different type of skill set, for instance, understanding the Millennial demographic, or someone who truly understands innovation and startups; so this opens up a new type of request for the profile of board members.”\n\n“Women should embrace their knowledge,” explains Sender. “For example my expertise is understanding consumers, and I have been invited to join the board of public companies such as Gerdau and Telefonica, one of the largest telephone operators and mobile network providers in the world.” Sender is often the youngest woman in the boardroom, but she clearly knows her value and the differentiated voice that she brings to the table.\n\nDespite seeing some progress towards closing the gender gap, there is still plenty of room for improvement. As women, this can be accomplished through continuous support and endorsement of each other, leveraging our networks to raise each other up, and not be afraid to speak up about our career aspirations. As we continue to move towards gender equality, we need to ensure that this is not just tokenism. We need to solve gender diversity at the fundamental level.\n\n*Disclosure: 500 Startups has an investment in these companies."

            "content": "BRUSSELS - The European Union’s top court ruled Thursday that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland broke EU law by refusing to comply with a refugee quota program launched after well over a million migrants entered the bloc, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn an emergency move in 2015, EU nations agreed to relocate up to 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece as those two countries buckled under the number of migrant arrivals. Five years on, Greece is still struggling to manage the burden, with thousands of people held in deplorable conditions in the Greek islands.\n\nThat “temporary relocation mechanism” decision was made in a vote requiring about a two-thirds majority among the EU member countries — 28 at the time. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were among a small group of nations that voted against the move.\n\nIn the end, only about 40,000 refugees were relocated. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland took in almost none over the two years the scheme was in operation. The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, sought an explanation but they gave no satisfactory answers.\n\nIn its ruling, the European Court of Justice said that “by refusing to comply with the temporary mechanism for the relocation of applicants for international protection, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have failed to fulfil their obligations under European Union law.”\n\nThe three had argued that EU countries alone are responsible for ensure public safety and not the commission, which drew up the quota scheme and took the countries to court.\n\nBut the Luxembourg based ECJ said they “can rely neither on their responsibilities concerning the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security, nor on the alleged malfunctioning of the relocation mechanism to avoid implementing that mechanism.”\n\nThe failure of nations to take part in a burden-sharing measure meant to help EU partners in distress was at the heart of one of the bloc’s biggest political crises. The issue of immigration then became a major vote-winner for far-right parties.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis shrugged off the court ruling.\n\n“The key thing is that we won’t accept any migrants and that the quota system ceased to exist in the meantime,” he told local media. “And that happened due to us, mainly,” said Babis who is known for his anti-migrant rhetoric.\n\nHungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga said that “the idea of the ‘migrant quota’ was unreasonable from the beginning and it was never fully implemented by almost any country.” She said Hungary “will continue to fight against the European mainstream, who still do not understand that supporting migration is not a good response to the problems of Europe.”\n\nBut European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the decision, which she said will be useful as the EU’s executive arm draws up a new “Pact for Migration” aimed at resolving longstanding differences over asylum policy and migration management more generally.\n\n“The ruling is important. It is about the past, but it will guide our work in the future,“ von der Leyen told reporters.\n\nGet more of the Star in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Star.

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. (Francois Lenoir, Pool Photo via AP)\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union’s top court ruled Thursday that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland broke EU law by refusing to comply with a refugee quota program launched after well over a million migrants entered the bloc, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn an emergency move in 2015, EU nations agreed to relocate up to 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece as those two countries buckled under the number of migrant arrivals. Five years on, Greece is still struggling to manage the burden, with thousands of people held in deplorable conditions in the Greek islands.\n\nThat “temporary relocation mechanism” decision was made in a vote requiring about a two-thirds majority among the EU member countries — 28 at the time. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were among a small group of nations that voted against the move.\n\nIn the end, only about 40,000 refugees were relocated. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland took in almost none over the two years the scheme was in operation. The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, sought an explanation but they gave no satisfactory answers.\n\nIn its ruling, the European Court of Justice said that “by refusing to comply with the temporary mechanism for the relocation of applicants for international protection, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have failed to fulfill their obligations under European Union law.”\n\nThe three had argued that EU countries alone are responsible for ensure public safety and not the commission, which drew up the quota scheme and took the countries to court.\n\nBut the Luxembourg based ECJ said they “can rely neither on their responsibilities concerning the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security, nor on the alleged malfunctioning of the relocation mechanism to avoid implementing that mechanism.”\n\nThe failure of nations to take part in a burden-sharing measure meant to help EU partners in distress was at the heart of one of the bloc’s biggest political crises. The issue of immigration then became a major vote-winner for far-right parties.\n\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis shrugged off the court ruling.\n\n“The key thing is that we won’t accept any migrants and that the quota system ceased to exist in the meantime,” he told local media. “And that happened due to us, mainly,” said Babis who is known for his anti-migrant rhetoric.\n\nHungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga said that “the idea of the ‘migrant quota’ was unreasonable from the beginning and it was never fully implemented by almost any country.” She said Hungary “will continue to fight against the European mainstream, who still do not understand that supporting migration is not a good response to the problems of Europe.”\n\nBut European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the decision, which she said will be useful as the EU’s executive arm draws up a new “Pact for Migration” aimed at resolving longstanding differences over asylum policy and migration management more generally.\n\n“The ruling is important.
