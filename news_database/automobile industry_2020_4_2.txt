Looking for alternative ways to reach your B2C customers?\n\nIn this article, you’ll discover how businesses in five B2C industries are using LinkedIn to connect with individual prospects and consumers.\n\nThe Case for B2C Outreach on LinkedIn\n\nAlthough LinkedIn has traditionally been known as a B2B network, the platform is ripe for B2C brands looking for better ways to connect with their target audiences. LinkedIn can also be a promising alternative to Facebook for B2C brands wanting to connect organically and educate users about their products.\n\nAmong the abundance of work-related content, brands can easily stand out by publishing content that relates to people’s interests outside of work. LinkedIn also provides a gateway to engage with professionals who might enjoy higher-end B2C products. These brands can drive engagement on a platform where their target audience resides during the workday.\n\nThis article highlights real-world examples of B2C brands that are effectively using LinkedIn in their organic or paid social media strategies.\n\nBrands Using Organic Feed Content on LinkedIn\n\nAlthough LinkedIn is home to a network of professional and business profiles, it’s important to remember that each member of the community is a unique person with their own interests outside of work. Unlike Facebook’s reach for brands, LinkedIn doesn’t require the same pay-to-play mentality to start building an audience.\n\nAcross the platform, a myriad of B2C brands are growing an audience of users who are interested in their products. Not only do these pages share updates related to their business and industry but they also publish relevant content about the products they sell. This content often follows the same style as posts you’d find across Facebook or Instagram. The posts are visually captivating and use creative ways to drive engagement.\n\nWhen your average worker is consuming content in their LinkedIn feed, these B2C posts can quickly stand out because they’re different from the typical content users have grown to expect on the platform.\n\n#1: Travel Companies\n\nVISION Destinations is a LinkedIn-native travel page, helping busy professionals discover their next holiday. The page curates and distributes inspiring content related to the travel industry.\n\nThe page quickly scaled to 13,000 followers in just 3 months and helps drive traffic to the VISION Destinations blog and travel store.\n\nThe content published on the page follows a similar style to what you’d see on a Facebook travel page but is unlike the norm for LinkedIn content. Each post includes a high-quality image or video of a travel destination, accompanied by a story or description of the scene. The posts also utilize a portrait format to maximize the screen real estate in the LinkedIn feed.\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines has identified LinkedIn as a distribution channel for not only business-related flights but also for people looking to book personal experiences outside of work. The content they publish on their LinkedIn page reflects the look and feel of their other social channels like Instagram and Facebook.\n\nKLM consistently shares content about updates to their service offerings such as flight lounges, planes, and in-flight perks. They also publish scenic images and videos of their planes from a behind-the-scenes perspective, helping educate customers about the experience of flying with the airline.\n\nThe brand also adds a touch of humor in their posts and takes advantage of relevant public holidays and seasonal periods. This type of content helps them stand out from other branded pages on LinkedIn.\n\n#2: Sporting Goods Companies\n\nCallaway Golf understands the relationship between the brand and business professionals. With an audience of more than 60,000 on LinkedIn, they use the channel to distribute content about golfing culture and their products.\n\nWhenever the company releases a new product line, they publish video content across LinkedIn to share the announcement.\n\nSharing news about new product releases encourages their audience on LinkedIn to add their thoughts about the new product and even tag their work friends with whom they play golf.\n\nCallaway also publishes content around seasonal trends that align with its products. Whether it’s Valentine’s Day, Halloween, or International Women’s Day, they create unique assets that showcase their products for each occasion. Additionally, they’ll use professional golfers as influencers to help build social proof when promoting their products.\n\nBrands Using Paid Ads\n\nAs a paid ad platform, LinkedIn has made some significant enhancements for businesses looking to publish more creative and relevant experiences. With the introduction of carousel ads, lookalike audiences, and conversion tracking, brands now have an effective toolset to create high-performing ad experiences.\n\nTraditionally, LinkedIn has been an expensive alternative to ad platforms like Facebook. With cost per results on LinkedIn significantly higher than other platforms, social media marketers have had a hard time justifying the cost. However, with Facebook’s rising cost per action (CPA), the cost gap between the two platforms is slowly beginning to close.\n\nThe additional appeal of LinkedIn’s ad platform to businesses is the quality of conversions. Although an ad platform like Facebook will be cost-effective at driving leads, the quality of leads generated through LinkedIn might be more relevant to your brand, particularly if you’re promoting a high-cost item.\n\nAs an alternate strategy to using only one of these ad platforms, brands can integrate both solutions into their overall paid strategy at different stages of the funnel.\n\nFor instance, if you acquire higher-quality leads at the top of your funnel with LinkedIn lead generation ads, you can then retarget this refined audience on Facebook or Instagram, where your ads can drive more specific conversion events at a lower CPA.\n\nJoin thousands of fellow marketers. Receive the training and support you need to accomplish your marketing objectives! Now Open Learn More\n\nB2C brands that best utilize LinkedIn in their paid strategy are those that sell higher-cost products, in which case the higher CPA for top-of-funnel leads will reflect the final sale price.\n\n#3: Automobile Companies\n\nLuxury car dealer Genesis Motors uses carousel ads across LinkedIn to promote their fleet of vehicles. These engaging ad assets not only showcase the car itself but also highlight key features across each carousel card.\n\nGenesis Motors also uses LinkedIn’s native lead generation ad format to convert users interested in registering for a test-drive experience. This creates a seamless process for people to quickly register their details without having to leave the LinkedIn platform.\n\nLead generation ads like the one below showcase Genesis Motors’ products using native LinkedIn video, which autoplays when a user scrolls to the ad in their feed.\n\n#4: Computer Companies\n\nTech companies like Microsoft and Dell often sell directly to large businesses at an enterprise scale. Notably, both brands have started promoting their products to individual consumers across LinkedIn.\n\nBecause LinkedIn lets you target people based on their specific job role or company size, it’s feasible for these brands to reach small business owners and early-stage founders looking to update their personal devices.\n\nFollowing their paid Facebook strategy, Dell promoted a consumer sale for their computers over the 2019 holiday season. These carousel ads sported a Christmas theme to display individual products on each card. Dell also promoted a current sale at their online store.\n\nLike all paid ad experiences, taking advantage of LinkedIn’s creative ad formats can help you drive more engagement and conversions from your target audience.\n\nMicrosoft uses LinkedIn to promote not only their work-related products but also their gaming consoles. The copy in the ad below is engaging because it acknowledges that busy professionals need downtime to relax and entertain themselves. The carousel format allows them to display an array of products and bundles available to purchase.\n\n#5: Clothing Companies\n\nLingerie brand ThirdLove is dedicated to empowering women to feel comfortable and confident in their everyday lives. They manufacture bras that are “designed to fit perfectly.”\n\nThe brand acknowledges that a large portion of their customers’ day is spent at work. In their paid ads on LinkedIn, ThirdLove showcases how their product line can help comfortably support women.\n\nSome of ThirdLove’s ads use customer testimonials or quotes from industry publishers to help build social proof with consumers.\n\nLinkedIn Ad Targeting Strategies for B2C If you’re a B2C brand that’s ready to use LinkedIn ads as a paid channel, the following are some useful targeting strategies to help you drive more conversions. Target Based on Seniority Seniority is a fairly basic targeting parameter but it can be relevant for B2C brands with higher-end products. By prioritizing users with a higher level of seniority, you can reach individuals with more disposable income. Member Traits As a social platform, LinkedIn can classify user activity and create a knowledge graph of behaviors and traits. By targeting your ads using member traits, you can reach users who frequently travel (both domestically and internationally) or have shown intent to seek education. If you’re a B2C brand selling consumer products for the travel or education industry, these parameters will be invaluable in your targeting. Lookalike Audience of Top-Performing Customers LinkedIn’s self-serve ad platform is gradually becoming more like Facebook Ads Manager, creating an opportunity to repurpose existing Facebook strategies that have worked well for you. While LinkedIn custom audiences don’t factor in lifetime value, you can export a list of your top-performing customers to LinkedIn and then build a lookalike audience to uncover new prospects. By creating a list of your top 1,000 customers, LinkedIn’s user graph will uncover common profile data and behaviors among these users. When LinkedIn builds a lookalike audience, they only include members who have recently been active on the platform, ensuring you reach the most relevant users. It’s important to note that LinkedIn will also automatically exclude those users in your original source audience, meaning you won’t have to spend time refining your exclusions list. Pro Tip: If you want to get a better understanding of how other businesses in your industry are harnessing the power of LinkedIn ads, click on the Ads tab on their company page to see their current ad experiences. Similar to Facebook’s ad library, analyzing your competitors’ ads is a great way to get inspiration and keep an eye on what competitors are doing.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough LinkedIn is a longstanding network for professionals, it’s still in its infancy for B2C brands looking to get the most out of the platform. With the ability to build a highly engaged audience organically, B2C brands have the opportunity to get a jump on their competitors.\n\nWhat do you think?

(File Photo) Industry sources said they expected April to be worse, as the lockdown — currently for 21 days from March 25 — would continue for half of the month. (File Photo)\n\nMaruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL), the country’s leading car manufacturer, on Wednesday announced a 47 per cent fall in its domestic passenger vehicle sales in March, a near 10-year low in terms of unit sales.\n\nThe company sold 76,240 units last month; the number from a year ago — March 2019 — was 1,45,031 units. Industry data show that MSIL sold 75,000-80,000 units every month on average in the second half of 2009-10, numbers that are comparable to those of March 2020.\n\nThe second largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, Hyundai Motor India, announced a 40.69 per cent decline in sales in March compared to the same period last year. The company sold 26,300 units this March as against 44,350 units last year.\n\nToyota Kirloskar Motors too announced a 45 per cent decline in sales. The company sold 7,023 units in the domestic market in March as against 12,818 units in March last year.\n\nCar sales have been under pressure over the last 18 months on account of the slowdown in the economy and a decline in consumption. Sales took a sharp additional hit in March due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic and the nationwide lockdown that followed.\n\nIndustry sources said they expected April to be worse, as the lockdown — currently for 21 days from March 25 — would continue for half of the month. Even after the lockdown is lifted, no one really knows how long it may take things to come back to normal, they said.\n\nExplained Virus the last straw in crisis The decline in automobile sales started on account of a funding and liquidity squeeze in July-August 2018, and went on to become more of a sentiment issue, with individuals looking to postpone and cut down on consumption expenditure. The coronavirus pandemic was the last straw in the crisis.\n\n“Last month has been very challenging for us, both in terms of sales as well as production. With the spread of the COVID-19 threat in various parts of the country followed by the 21-day national lockdown, the company’s priority was to ensure the safety and well-being of all stakeholders and, most importantly, our dealers and their staff…,” Naveen Soni, Senior VP, sales and service, Toyota Kirloskar Motor said. “Our dealerships across the country were shut down beginning March 23, along with a temporary halt of production at our plant in Bidadi.”\n\nMSIL reported a decline in sales across all segments. The compact segment declined 51 per cent to 40,519 units; the utility vehicle segment saw a 53.4 per cent fall, and sales in the van segment fell 63.7 per cent.\n\nWith global trade crippled by the virus, MSIL’s exports declined 55 per cent — the company exported only 4,712 units in March as against 10,463 units in the corresponding month in 2019.\n\nOn March 22, as several states announced lockdowns, carmakers including MSIL, Hyundai Motors, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles together with Fiat India Automobiles, and Hero MotoCorp announced they were cutting output. Several firms announced they would stand by their staff — there would be no retrenchments at any plant, and workers would continue to receive salaries for the period of closure.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Prev Next View All\n\nThe terrible sales reports are here, including Hyundai, Fiat Chrysler, Porsche, and Europe, and the UAW is trying to shape up. That and more in The Morning Shift for Wednesday, April 1, 2020.\n\n\n\n1st Gear: The Car Sales News Is Bad!\n\nLet’s check in on Hyundai:\n\nHyundai, one of the hottest brands over the last 24 months behind an expanded crossover lineup, posted a 43 percent decline in U.S. sales last month, underscoring the sudden impact the coronavirus is having on automakers and dealers alike. March deliveries totaled 35,118, with retail demand falling 39 percent and fleet volume dropping 54 percent, Hyundai said, even as the brand quickly rolled out a promotion that included no-interest loans and deferred payments for four months on select models. In the first two months of the year, Hyundai’s U.S. deliveries rose 11 percent, but volume dropped 11 percent in the first quarter on the sharply weaker March results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet’s check in on Europe:\n\nIndustry association ACEA demanded “strong and coordinate action” to aid manufacturers, their suppliers and dealers who all face a “severe” financial hit. “The effect of the coronavirus on the automobile industry is unprecedented,” ACEA Director General Eric-Mark Huitema said in a statement. “It is becoming increasingly clear that Covid-19 has led to the worst crisis ever to impact the automotive sector.” EU-wide production losses from factory shutdowns amount to 1.23 million vehicles so far, with some 1.11 million workers affected, not including the supply chain, ACEA said. The wider sector provides jobs for 13.8 million people across the European Union, ACEA said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet’s check in on Porsche:\n\nPorsche Cars North America, Inc. (PCNA) today announced a year-on-year decline in first quarter U.S. retail deliveries as the coronavirus pandemic slowed overall automotive sales. PCNA is the sole licensed importer and distributor of the Porsche 911, 718 Boxster and Cayman, Macan, Cayenne, Panamera and Taycan model lines. Retail deliveries by the 192 independently owned and operated U.S. dealers totaled 11,994 from January through March, down 20.2 percent from a year ago, after a record 2019 that marked a decade of sustained growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about Tesla? Tesla must be doing all right, they are the future of the world after all, they are our new gods, they are\n\nWhile Musk tried to salvage the quarter by introducing a “touchless” delivery option in select locations, the coronavirus pandemic is expected to have done a number on demand for all automakers. Analysts on average estimate Tesla delivered roughly 77,400 cars worldwide last quarter, the first to include hand-overs of the new Model Y crossover. While that would be a jump from a disappointing result a year ago, it also would mark a more than 30% drop from the record deliveries Tesla reported for the last three months of 2019. “Tesla typically delivers a disproportionate share of its quarter’s units in the last two weeks of the quarter,” Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report Monday. “Given the disruption to production and logistics bandwidth, we would be prepared for a weak number.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFiat Chrysler, maybe you guys had better luck?\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles reported a 10 percent decline in first quarter sales as a virus-impacted March more than offset gains in January and February. [...] At FCA US, Ram was the only brand with a first-quarter gain — 3 percent. Volume dropped 14 percent at Jeep, 20 percent at Dodge, 5 percent at Chrysler, 49 percent at Fiat and 14 percent at Alfa Romeo, the company said. The automaker on Wednesday launched a new round of special incentives, including 0 percent financing for 84 months and no payments for 90 days on select 2019 and 2020 vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh. Hmm. This is all about as bad as we thought.\n\nUpdate, 10:40 a.m.: Here’s Mazda:\n\nMazda North American Operations (MNAO) today reported total March sales of 15,664 vehicles, a decrease of 41.8 percent compared to March 2019. Year-to-date sales totaled 67,670 vehicles, a decrease of 4.5 percent. With 25 selling days in March, compared to 27 the year prior, the company posted a decrease of 37.2 percent on a Daily Selling Rate (DSR) basis. CPO sales totaled 3,392 vehicles in March, a decrease of 38.9 percent compared to March 2019. Year-to-date CPO sales decreased 2.5 percent, with 13,510 vehicles sold. Mazda Motor de Mexico (MMdM) reported March sales of 3,432 vehicles, a decrease of 43.1 percent compared to March last year. Year-to-date sales decreased 20.2 percent, with 12,922 vehicles sold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd GM:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate, 11:46 a.m.: And Mitsu and Nissan:\n\nMitsubishi Motors North America, Inc. (MMNA) today reported March sales of 9,394 vehicles, down 52 percent over March of 2019. Calendar year-to-date sales through the end of March totaled 35,563 vehicles, a decrease of 15.5 percent compared with the same period in 2019. News and Notes In response to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, all MMNA headquarters and regional team members began working from home as of March 16. As of today, 97 dealerships (28% of MMNA’s national count) have closed the sales side of their facilities, and another 94 (27%) are open by appointment-only, due to local government order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2nd Gear: Subaru Is Also Bending To Reality\n\nThey will shut down production in Japan and extend their production shutdowns in the U.S., according to Automotive News.\n\nSubaru’s suspension will affect its main assembly operations in Gumma as well as an engine and transmission plant, taking factories offline for 17 workdays, the company said April 1. The shutdown translates to roughly 39,100 units of lost production, given the Gumma complex’s normal output rate of 2,300 vehicles a day, Subaru said. The move affects popular U.S. export nameplates such as the Forester and Crosstrek crossovers. Last year, Subaru of America sold 335,504 imported vehicles. The plant also produces the WRX and BRZ sporty cars for the U.S. as well as a host of vehicles, ncluding the Outback crossover, Legacy sedan, Levorg wagon and Impreza small car, for both Japan and export markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3rd Gear: Aston Martin Has A New Reality\n\nBillionaire Lawrence Stroll has injected some money into the automaker, but because of coronavirus that may not be nearly enough, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe automaker does not have sufficient working capital based on European Securities and Markets Authority rules because the coronavirus has created “increased and unquantifiable uncertainty” in its business, Aston Martin said. That has made it impossible to come up with a model for a “reasonable worse case downside,” the company said. Aston Martin, which has struggled with cash flow and dealer-inventory back-ups since going public in 2018, had hoped that the fundraising approved by shareholders on Monday would avoid the need to seek additional money. But the coronavirus crisis has added a level of difficulty to the turnaround put in place with Stroll’s arrival. “Taking into account the proceeds of the capital raise, the company is of the opinion that the group does not have sufficient working capital to meet its requirements for 12 months” from February, when it published the original prospectus for the Stroll bailout, the company said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4th Gear: The UAW Is Trying To Clean Up Its Act\n\nThere will be a hotline for members to report corruption, and they have also appointed a former chair of the National Labor Relations Board as its first independent ethics officer. These measures are all in response to, well, you know, and an effort to stave off a federal takeover.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Automotive News:\n\nIn her new role, [former NLRB chair Wilma Liebman] will work with third-party company Exiger LLC, which the union has tapped to serve as its new ethics ombudsman. Exiger workers will screen and investigate tips placed to a new ethics hotline, which goes live today, the union said. Gamble first announced the search for an ombudsman and independent ethics officer in November, shortly after taking over for ex-President Gary Jones, who is expected to plead guilty to charges of embezzlement next month as part of a yearslong federal corruption investigation. “While our country and union navigate the difficult challenges of this pandemic, today’s actions mark an important step in the progress of our ethics reform agenda and underline our unwavering pledge to our members that their union is committed to operating at the highest level of integrity on their behalf,” Gamble said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UAW also said last week its open to meeting with federal investigators. The UAW is very sorry for all of that corruption!\n\n5th Gear: China Is (Maybe) Easing Electric Car Quotas\n\nThis is, ostensibly, to help the car industry’s recovery there post- (or, more accurately, amid) coronavirus. China is the world’s biggest car market, and its push for electric cars has been a nudge for the entire industry. These new rules may or may not happen, according to Reuters, but I wouldn’t expect the overall picture to change when this is all over.\n\n“Policymakers acknowledged that automakers are strained to promote electric models when overall demand is slowing. They want the auto industry to recover steadily this year,” one of the four people familiar with the matter said. Authorities are still reviewing the details of the plan, which has yet to be finalised, sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The review is being discussed with officials at industry and environment ministries as well as automakers and industry bodies. The policy shift comes as Xin Guobin, vice industry minister, said on Monday that China would “make adjustments on new energy vehicles and related policies to further promote the coordinated and healthy development of the automotive industry.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReverse: RIP\n\nVia History:\n\nOn April 1, 1993, race car driver and owner Alan Kulwicki, who won the 1992 National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) Winston Cup championship by one of the tightest margins in series history, is killed in a plane crash near Bristol, Tennessee, where he was scheduled to compete in a race the following day. The 38-year-old Kulwicki had been the first owner-driver to collect the championship since Richard Petty did so in 1979, as well as the first NASCAR champ to hold a college degree. Kulwicki was born on December 14, 1954, in Greenfield, Wisconsin, a fact that later marked him as an outsider among the other NASCAR drivers of his era, who typically hailed from the southern U.S. Kulwicki’s father, Gerry, built race-car engines and as a teenager Alan became involved in Go-Kart racing. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in mechanical engineering, Kulwicki raced stock cars, first as a hobby then as a professional. In the mid-1980s, he relocated to North Carolina and, with no financial backing, began competing in NASCAR events. In 1986 he was named the Winston Cup Series (now known as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) Rookie of the Year. Kulwicki, who earned a reputation as a hard-working perfectionist, later turned down offers to drive for other teams, opting to remain on his own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeutral: How ... Are Things?\n\nI’m in my 18th or 19th day of isolation, depending on how I count, I’ve gone through (a few) bottles of vodka, everything’s great, you see, nothing worrying or wrong at all."

            "content": "I will show you why the car industry will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic even after the pandemic has been overcome.\n\nThe car industry is likely to be hit much worse than other parts of the economy – and this is NOT priced in already.\n\nThe short and long term effects of the pandemic on the car industry are going to be disastrous.\n\nLately, the economy has been in turmoil. No sector is being spared in this downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Major economic shutdowns like those happening now are almost unprecedented and are leading to disastrous performance of stocks across the board. In this article, I will argue why a single sector – the car industry – is going to be hit by this global pandemic more than other sectors, and in a more long-lasting way. I will also show that this is not priced in at the moment. I will show this using 3 main arguments.\n\nReason 1: demand side dry-up\n\nIt is generally accepted that car sales are usually solid in a flourishing economy and bad as the economy turns sour. Of course, the car industry has always been a relatively volatile one, which means that one would expect car producers to take a major hit when a crisis like this happens. One of the main indicators which can predict how bad it is going to be is the weekly initial jobless claims, which has skyrocketed lately:\n\nIf people lose their jobs, the first spending they will probably cut is their discretionary spending, such as luxury items, holidays, and new vehicles.\n\nThe general theory is that over time, demand for cars will likely be restored, or such as it was after the previous economic crises. Let us take a look at the demand for vehicles in the world’s two main economies: China and the US:\n\nUS car sales (in million per month)\n\nChina car sales (per month)\n\nAs you can see, vehicle demand in the US during the great recession of 2008-2009 dropped by about 50%. In China, this crisis is barely noticeable in the chart because car sales continued to grow quickly after this. If you look closer, you can argue that car sales also dropped during this period though they peaked just before.\n\nBut more interestingly, the first 2020 data from China has already been used in this graph, and it is devastating:\n\nVehicles sales in China tumbled 79 percent from a year ago to 310,000 units in February 2020, the steepest yearly decline on record, as the coronavirus outbreak hurt demand. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells fell for an eighth straight month. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) expects that vehicles sales will decrease by more than 10 percent in the first half of the year, and around 5 percent in 2020 full year, if the outbreak is effectively contained before April. Vehicle sales will return to normal in the third quarter. Meanwhile, automakers in China have called for cuts to the purchase tax on smaller vehicles, measures to support sales in rural markets and an easing of car emission requirements (source: tradingeconomics)\n\nSo we can already conclude that Chinese vehicle sales slowdown is more severe than in 2008-2009. Of course, it is not fair to extrapolate these numbers to US or European data. Because as it looks like now, China was hurt badly by the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is every reason to believe that the US will be hit ever worse by this crisis. I would not be surprised if car sales data of the US will prove to be worse than the Chinese data.\n\nReason 2: Long term demand impediments\n\nPerhaps never before in modern history have so many people worked from home. Forced by lockdowns or shelter-in-place by ever more countries, companies are finding ways to allow their employees to work from home.\n\nOf course, this sudden increase in people working from home has internet providers and corporate networks pressures to the maximum. But it looks increasingly like the situation will not go back to how it was: many employees who are now working from home are already starting to question why they needed to go in to the office in the first place. Some interesting quotes from over the internet related to the surge in working from home:\n\nIn Seattle, the hub of many of America’s early Covid-19 cases, companies including Amazon, LinkedIn, Microsoft and Google advised workers to stop coming in to the office in late February. In early March, Twitter “strongly advised” all its employees worldwide to do the same, and on Wednesday, made it compulsory. (source: The Guardian) This might also offer an opportunity for many companies to finally build a culture that allows long-overdue work flexibility. Millions of people will get the chance to experience days without long commutes, or the harsh inflexibility of not being able to stay close to home when a family member is sick. (source: ma.tt) “We’ll never probably be the same ..... People who were reticent to work remotely will find that they really thrive that way. Managers who didn’t think they could manage teams that were remote will have a different perspective. I do think we won’t go back.” (source: Buzzfeed)\n\nI concur with most of the above statements. Even if many workers will go back to their physical workplace after the shutdowns are lifted, there will be many people who will continue to work from home more than they did before. It is very difficult to predict how this will turn out in the end, maybe two days in the office, three days from home will become the norm after a while? It often takes a crisis like this one to get major cultural shifts going. I believe this is one of the large cultural shifts which we will see taking shape as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOf course, people will still want to own cars. But if fewer cars are used for daily commutes, people are likely to buy cheaper cars since they are not using them as often. Also, people might postpone a car replacement, seeing it as less essential. Even after the lockdowns will be gone and the economic crisis is over (these two will not go hand in hand), car manufacturers will feel the results of COVID-19.\n\nReason 3: Oil\n\nOne of the most promising developments in the car industry is the development of electric vehicles (EVs). There have been a couple of main reasons why this development is so promising: sustainability, efficiency, and cheap cost of usage, since charging up your battery with electricity is usually cheaper than fueling up your car with petrol. The drop in the oil prices is actually likely to be very bad for EVs. People interested in buying an EV might put this investment off for some time, not only because of the current state of the economy but also because of the enormous drop in oil prices, making it more attractive to keep driving old gasoline cars for a while longer.\n\nCrude oil has dropped to levels not seen for 20 years (source: investing.com)\n\nEven if you think the effect of the oil price on car sales will be limited, consider this: would you be more tempted to buy a more fuel-efficient car at a petrol price of $2 per gallon or when petrol costs are $4 per gallon? And an EV? Everyone should reach his on conclusion here, but on average, consumers will be less tempted to buy new cars when it is relatively cheap to continue using their old vehicle.\n\nThis is not priced in\n\nLet us take a look at the performance of the S&P 500 during this crisis:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nPerformance of the S&P 500 year to date: minus 20%\n\nAnd let us look at an ETF which follows car manufacturers:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nPerformance of the First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF ytd: minus 29%\n\nAs you can see, the performance of the car manufacturer ETF has been much worse than that of the S&P 500. This is expected, since the car industry is usually a relatively volatile industry.\n\nBut let us compare the car industry to other relatively volatile industries. Let's take banks for instance:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nPerformance of the S&P Bank ETF ytd: minus 43%\n\nIf you feel like banks are no fair comparison, consider the S&P Global Luxury Index:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nPerformance of the S&P Global Luxury Index ytd: minus 28%\n\nNow this compares more or less to the car manufacturer index. Let us take a look at the major constituents of the Luxury Index:\n\nS&P 500 Luxury Index constituents (source: spindices)\n\nOf course, largest constituent of this index is Tesla (TSLA), and Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF) is also part of it, so there is some overlap. But companies like LVMH (OTCPK:LVMHF) (Fashion and liquor producer) and Kering (OTCPK:PPRUF) (design goods) are a truly different market. Of course, luxury products and liquor will also be affected by the economic crisis where we are going through right now. But I do not see them having direct problems as a result of the oil slump or a cultural shift with regard to working from home.\n\nConclusion\n\nI presented three main reasons why the car industry is going to take a major hit from the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nThe 'normal' fallout from the economic crisis\n\nA cultural shift to more working from home\n\nThe current oil crisis\n\nEventually, humanity will find a solution for this pandemic. The economic crisis will subside, and oil prices might return to normal. But even then, car manufacturers will continue to feel the results of a cultural shift to working from home.\n\nAs I have shown above, the general economic turndown is currently priced in for car manufacturers. The oil crisis is not priced in, since it does not seem to directly hurt car manufacturers (but it does!). Fewer car sales as a result of working from home is a factor which is not priced in at all. I would recommend selling car stocks.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

            "content": "Subaru is joining the long list of automakers closing shop on account of the coronavirus. Japanese production is being suspended at the automaker’s main plaint in the country’s Gunma prefecture from April 11th through the first of May. It’s also idling the Oizumi engine facility as it announces plans to extend the suspension of its U.S. facility in Indiana. The plant will now be idled through April 20th.\n\nWhile some of the closures are due to social distancing obligations, the rest is down to parts allocation. Subaru is heavily reliant on components manufactured in China, and it’s still not clear how things are actually going there. What is clear is that Subaru (and plenty of other manufacturers) can’t do without its robust industrial sector operating at full strength. Subaru CFO Toshiaki Okada said in February that “it’s impossible to manufacture cars without China.”\n\nLike most Japanese manufacturers, Subaru is being negatively affected by supply chain breakdowns stretching back to when COVID-19 first emerged in China’s Wuhan province. While the People’s Republic is now supposed to be in recovery, according to its own state-backed media, its national leadership expelled U.S. journalists two weeks ago at a time when reliable information was already difficult to come by.\n\nOfficially, China has managed to put a cap on the coronavirus, though estimates from Wuhan citizens speaking to Radio Free Asia suggest the death toll and infection rate were much higher than claimed — referencing the large number of urns being delivered to funeral homes and crematoriums as circumstantial evidence.\n\nWhile the World Health Organization (WHO) supports China’s official coronavirus headcount, that body faces growing criticisms for initially claiming there was no reason to enact travel restrictions — something all countries have since done to curtail the virus’ spread. Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the Director General of the WHO, also refused to recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation in a recent interview (before later suggesting it was part of China).\n\nThis calls the legitimacy of both China and the WHO’s COVID-19 estimates into question, making it more difficult to predict how the recovery is actually faring in the PRC. Japanese automakers are still noting supply chain issues stemming from factory closures, with some reopened Chinese facilities reportedly operating with a fraction of their normal staff.\n\nMazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota have all enacted factory suspensions in Japan. Some of those are in response to localized health concerns aimed at slowing COVID-19’s spread. Others, however, are the direct result of supply chain problems with China and uncertainties as to when components can be reliably sourced from the country. On Monday, vice industry minister Xin Guobin said China’s manufacturing output had returned to between 70 to 90 percent of its normal strength. Still, in the same announcement he also warned other nations to prepare for rather serious supply chain hardships (especially in relation to exports) over the coming weeks.\n\nJapanese automakers have already established the New Coronavirus Countermeasures Automobile Council to contend with virus-related complications. While its primary mission is mitigating COVID-19’s spread through the industrial sector, it also places a strong focus on figuring out how to help car companies navigate supply problems. Even if China has turned a corner, supply chains will take a while to catch up, with a lingering gap in consumer demand.\n\n[Image: Subaru]"
