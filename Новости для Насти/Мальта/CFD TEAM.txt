This story was updated at 1:16 p.m. on Oct. 29, 2019, with a statement from Unum and more information.
Last night, Chattanooga Fire Department officials received a call that Unum was sending people home with headaches from their downtown campus on Walnut Street.
An employee who came by a fire station had elevated carbon monoxide levels, according to the fire department.
Then, CFD started receiving reports that other employees were showing up at hospitals with elevated CO levels.
Later, Unum called Station 1 and CFD crews responded, fire officials state. They found elevated CO levels in a construction area.
The HVAC system was purged to vent through the roof and the ventilation dropped the CO levels to well within normal range.
One of Unum's buildings was closed Tuesday after the reports and employees showing signs of illness on Monday, said Kelly Spencer, a Unum spokesperson.
"We are investigating the cause of this incident and testing the air quality," she wrote in an email. "Unum's top priority is the health and safety of employees. Efforts will continue to ensure that the workspace is safe and secure for all employees. Employees who have experienced health issues are encouraged to contact the company's HR response team."
Lindsey Rogers, CFD spokesperson, said the department continuously monitors firefighters for CO poisoning with portable detectors, and they use the same monitors to check patients.

The Chattanooga Fire Department (CFD) is investigating after it says dispatchers received a call that employees at Unum were being sent home from headaches Monday night, from its downtown campus on Walnut Street.
Unum tells NewsChannel 9 on Tuesday, "Unum’s top priority remains the health and safety of employees. Efforts will continue to ensure that workspace remains safe and secure for all employees."

CFD says an employee who came by a fire station was tested, and found to have elevated carbon monoxide levels.

Then, CFD says it started receiving reports that other employees were showing up at hospitals with elevated carbon monoxide (CO) levels.
Later, CFD says Unum called Station 1 and CFD crews responded. They found elevated CO levels in a construction area.
CFD says the HVAC system was purged to vent through the roof and the ventilation dropped the CO levels to well within normal range.
Tennessee OSHA is also investigating the incident, according to Chris Cannon, a spokesperson with the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development. "This investigation entails sending a letter to the building’s owner asking about the issue that caused workers to get sick and what measures were taken to fix the issue. Once the building’s owner responds, TOSHA will determine if any further action is necessary," said Cannon.
Unum says, "Employees who have experienced health issues are encouraged to contact the HR response team."

PLANS for a 29-turbine wind farm in Yell remain on track despite other renewable developments in Shetland like Viking Energy failing to win government support last month, according to its developer.
Statkraft UK managing director David Flood said during a visit to Shetland on Thursday that it is hoped the Energy Isles project will bid for future Contracts for Difference (CfD) subsidy auctions.
It comes after the 103-turbine, 457MW Viking Energy wind farm and smaller Peel Energy projects in Yell and outside Lerwick failed to secure vital support in the CfD process, which is the government’s main mechanism for supporting new low carbon electricity generation.

At the moment a proposed 600MW, HVDC interconnector linking Shetland to the national grid via Caithness – which is necessary for any large wind farm to go ahead – hinges on the Viking project getting the go-ahead.

The up to 200MW Energy Isles project – which recently saw Norwegian energy giant Statkraft sign on as a development partner – has yet to receive consent from the Scottish Government and as such it was not eligible for the last CfD round.
The next auction is set to take place in 2021 and Flood confirmed that Energy Isles is hoping to take part.
“Hopefully we’ll be eligible for either the next one or the one after,” he said.
“At the moment, our focus is on designing the right project that fits with the community and maximises the benefit to the community. We’ll think about those things a little bit further down the road hopefully.”
Referring to the chances of Energy Isles securing subsidy after Viking and Peel failed to do so, Flood said that Shetland projects should be more appealing to the government if a grid connection is in place.
“Shetland and Yell particularly is an excellent site for renewable energy,” he said.
“The wind resource is excellent. Once we have the grid connection sorted we do believe that projects will be very strong and very viable and able to deliver a lot of benefits to the community.”
Statkraft’s Europe grid manager Guy Nicholson reiterated the company’s view that Shetland is best served with an interconnector with a capacity greater than 600MW, taking into account the potential output of the projects already consented on the isles.

The Energy Isles team have pressed energy regulator Ofgem – which is yet to make a final decision on Shetland’s future energy needs – to consider a cable with a capacity of 800MW or even 1,000MW.
“We are pushing for a larger link to the built, simply because that is cost effective in terms of pounds per megawatt,” he said.
In an Energy Isles submission to an Ofgem consultation earlier this year on Shetland’s energy needs, the company also claimed a second 600MW cable linking the isles with the Scottish mainland has been proposed.
In the National Grid’s latest transmission works register report, published on 4 October, there is mention of a second HVDC link between the planned station at Kergord and Rothienorman in the North East of Scotland.
National Grid is considering this possibility because of the first one being potentially oversubscribed.
“There is already a second cable on that register which is linked to wind farms here,” Nicholson confirmed.
“That’s been proposed [by Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission], but who knows what that means at the moment. There’s a lot of works that get put on the register which change over time.”
Flood, meanwhile, confirmed that the total capital expenditure of the Energy Isles project would be around £160 million.
“Statkraft finances our projects from our balance sheet – we don’t borrow money from banks,” he said.
“We use our own capital in order to build our projects, which allows us to be very flexible and very quick in moving towards investment decisions on projects, so that would be our approach to this project as well.”
He confirmed that Energy Isles Ltd – a company made up of 54 largely Shetland based businesses acting as shareholders – will remain the same despite the deal for Statkraft to become a development partner.
The Energy Isles board and Statkraft were in negotiations for the “best part of a year” before the contract was signed.

Flood said the shareholders of Energy Isles Ltd – which include companies like Delta Marine, L&M Engineering, NB Communication and Nordri – “continue to be fully involved in the project”.
“Statkraft has bought the project from Energy Isles and will be taking the project forward in partnership with Energy Isles Ltd,” he said.
The proposed wind farm, meanwhile, has so far received objections from a number of sources, from Yell Community Council to Shetland Amenity Trust and Scottish Natural Heritage.
Energy Isles Shetland Ltd project manager Charlotte Healey, from Statkraft, said the development would continue to liaise with consultees as the plans develop.
“We’ve tried to maintain a very close relationship with statutory consultees and local people to try to design a scheme that best fits that area, and we continue to do as a team going forward, to take on those concerns and build those into the project,” she said.
“We started with a very large wind farm in the beginning and through our consultation with SNH and SEPA and different statutory consultees and Shetland Amenity Trust, we’ve really tried to take those on board and we have a much reduced scheme now.
“The environmental statement contains all the work we’ve done to date to address those concerns – all the studies we’ve done, and everything like that, which provides information on those concerns. We’ll continue to do so and work with those consultees to address those concerns.”
She added that the team hope to receive a decision from Shetland Islands Council planners in early to mid 2020, with the matter then progressing to the Scottish Government’s Energy Consents Unit.
Energy Isles director Derek Jamieson, meanwhile, pointed to the job hours which could be created if the wind farm goes ahead, as well as the community benefit money of up to £1 million which could come to Yell, Unst and Fetlar each year.
“What we’re looking to do is create a wind farm to generate carbon free energy with an associated community benefit fund, and also the other income for Shetland, so that’s the kind of things I think is very important to get across,” he said.

ATFX wants to encourage secure trading within what is a highly competitive and volatile sector
Financial education is the ultimate investment a trader can make. And yet, its value is often underestimated. Many enter the world of online brokerage with a certain degree of self-taught knowledge. While this can prove useful, without further guidance, traders are prone to overestimating their expertise – in fact, a recent OECD financial literacy survey found that most individuals rate themselves as having a higher level of financial knowledge than they actually possess. Trading is a skill just like any other, and neglecting to take one’s education seriously can have significant consequences.
Online brokers have become increasingly aware of the knowledge deficit that exists among their clientele, and a number have begun to realise the benefits of providing this much-needed education as a service. World Finance spoke to Ergin Erdemir, Head of Marketing at ATFX, to learn more about the educational tools the company provides.
What does ATFX offer to online global investors?
ATFX is a leading online forex and contract for difference (CFD) broker. Over the past few years, the platform has gone from strength to strength, providing exceptional customer service around the world in all major languages. In a stringent industry, ATFX wants to stand out by offering its clients unique services that provide them with better value for money. This includes ultra-low spreads and zero commission, as well as access to more than 200 financial products. Ultimately, we are dedicated to giving clients the best possible trading experience.
Can you tell us about the recent ESMA regulations and how they’ve affected your products?
Last year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) introduced a number of restrictions on the marketing, distribution and sale of CFD products to increase investor protection within the EU. ATFX has welcomed this legislation: we have always put traders’ interests at the forefront of our business, so this new regulation actually supports our brand values.
ATFX wants to encourage secure and efficient trading within what is a highly competitive and volatile sector. To do this, we ensure that our team is there for our clients throughout their trading journey and that each trader is well equipped to face the markets. ESMA’s product intervention is significant and something our company does not take lightly. As such, ATFX adheres to all of the relevant regulations while still offering highly competitive spreads and charging no commission, reducing the cost of trading for our clients.
What educational services does ATFX offer and why did the company decide to introduce them?
Despite the increased protection clients now benefit from, ATFX has found that many new and existing traders still struggle to enter and navigate financial markets. We realised that we could help our clients overcome these challenges by offering a bespoke service that engages with traders on a one-to-one basis. This exclusive education tool is available to both beginners and experienced traders who want to enhance their knowledge of financial markets.
As part of this programme, ATFX’s Global Chief Market Strategist, Alejandro Zambrano, delivers a daily webinar to discuss the state of the market and provide real-time insights to traders. In addition to this, he personally coaches existing and prospective clients through in-house seminars. In these seminars, Zambrano discusses how to manage risk through methods such as stop-loss and limit orders, technical analysis, fundamental analysis and trading psychology.
Education is a core part of what we do; ATFX wants its clients to fully understand the basics of trading and what is at stake. We don’t offer a rose-tinted view of trading – instead, we provide accurate, reliable and trustworthy information regarding risk, risk management, trading strategies and in-depth market analysis.
Despite the increased protection clients now benefit from, ATFX has found that many new and existing traders still struggle to enter and navigate financial markets
What are ATFX’s ambitions for the coming years?
ATFX is committed to expanding its services. In particular, we plan to take our education strategy beyond the UK market and into the rest of Europe. Another key goal we are working towards is making our services more accessible. With this in mind, we are currently developing a mobile app that will allow our clients to trade with absolute flexibility. Trading on the move can be difficult, so we hope this new app will give traders full access to their account and help them manage their portfolios with ease when they’re on the go.
We have also launched a new institutional offering aimed at high-net-worth individuals, funds, proprietary vehicles and retail broker aggregates. This new service provides clients with bespoke liquidity, competitive spreads and 24-hour pricing. We are dedicated to providing a seamless and effective interface for our institutional clients with simplicity, speed and reliability at its core.
ATFX prides itself on its customer-centric service. By dedicating efforts to enhancing clients’ trading experience, ATFX believes it will continue to be one of the world’s leading forex and CFD brokers.

More than 22,400 needles have been collected in a yearlong partnership between the Alpha House and city firefighters to address Calgary needle debris.
The combined effort has also resulted in more than 900 fewer needle calls to the Calgary Fire Department – or 226 per cent – compared with 2018.
“Alpha House, a community organization, leading the local needle response, is proving crucial in alleviating first responders to tend to other emergency calls across Calgary,” said CFD Assistant Deputy Chief Deb Bergeson, in a prepared release.
RELATED: Duelling petitions involving Calgary’s Alpha House
The Calgary Alpha House Society Needle Response Team has been in operation since July. The two organizations have been sharing data on common Calgary needle debris locations and the volume. Patrols have used it to collect and dispose of the needles and to redeploy needle collection boxes.
“Approximately 60 per cent of all needles collected are done so through patrols and our peer support program,” said Adam Melnyk, Outreach Manager, Alpha House.
“In the first six months of operation, the needle response team collected a volume of 6,570 needles, playing a vital role in our community, while building community.”
Calgary needle boxes redeployed based on data
Twenty-two needle debris boxes are managed by the Calgary Fire Department. Five are being relocated based on the collected data.
“The response from the community is very positive, as this is a cost-effective approach to public safety concerns and the work extends to cooperation with other agencies as we focus on educating businesses and individuals about safely picking up needles, while engaging with these communities,” said Melnyk.
Alpha House’s Needle Response Team can be reached at 403-796-5334 (via call or text) or email at needle@alphahousecalgary.com from Monday – Friday, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras researchers have developed algorithms that enable novel applications for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning to solve engineering problems. The Researchers are going to establish a startup to deploy their AI Software called ‘AISoft’ to develop solutions to engineering problems in varied fields such as in thermal management, semiconductors, automobile, aerospace and electronic cooling applications.
AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning are now being used for over a decade but traditionally only in areas such as signal processing, speech recognition, image reconstruction and prediction. Very limited attempts have been made globally in using these algorithms in solving engineering problems such as thermal management, electronic cooling industries, automobile problems like fluid dynamics prediction over a bonnet or inside the engine, aerospace industries like aerodynamics and fluid dynamics problems across an aero-foil or turbine engine.
A team of researchers lead by Dr. Vishal Nandigana, Assistant Professor, Fluid Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Madras, has developed AI and Deep Learning algorithms to solve engineering problems, which they do not solve a physical law to arrive at the solution of the system.
Highlighting the unique aspects of these algorithms, Dr. Vishal Nandigana said, “We tested AISoft and used it to solve such thermal management problems. We found it to be nearly million-fold faster compared to existing solutions currently used in the field. Our AI works on any generalized rectilinear and curvilinear input geometry. Our research saves the computational time, which is the bottleneck to solve most engineering problems."
The Researchers utilized a data-driven AI and a Deep Learning model to arrive at solutions for engineering problems after training the AI with data sets. These prior data sets can be from existing big data in the relevant engineering industry where there are lots of experimental data available. Also, if data is not available for training the AI, it can be generated using commercially-available CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software on small independent pieces of the full-blown problem.
Nandigana added that their AI is grid or mesh independent and does not need information of left and right grid points to solve the grid point of interest. It can work with sparse data sets and solve engineering problems and thus stands out in this aspect from commercially available software.
IIT Madras Researchers have also developed hardware products using GPU and multi-threading processing to solve thermal management problems in thermal and electronic cooling industries. Both the software and hardware products are several times faster than commercial numerical method software and open source software in the market. These algorithms will solve a lot of pressing problems for industries and can also be used for educational purposes.

The recent Russian Formula One Grand Prix demonstrated a real-time, reactive strategy that enabled Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport to overtake a possible Ferrari one-two win.
Data is critical to every aspect of how Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport runs, designs, builds and tests its race car and its race strategy.
Last year, the team celebrated its fifth consecutive double title after securing the FIA Formula One Constructors and the UK’s Lewis Hamilton took the Driver’s world championship.
As the 2019 Formula One season enters its final stages, there is pressure on all aspects of the business. Data is at the heart of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport team’s decision-making, both from a race strategy perspective and in its wide business operations.
Matt Harris, CTO of Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport, says: “Over the last five years, the importance of data coming from the car hasn’t got any different, but the time to make decisions has got much tighter.”
Harris says there is now a criticality in being able to visualise and turn data into insights and decisions that change the car’s configurations and what the race team needs to do during practice, qualifying and on race day. There is so much data – the telemetry data from the sensors on the car and the data from the race team, pre- and post-race simulations, dyno engine tests, complex fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel aerodynamics data.
“The holy grail would be to do a test in dyno, relate that to the simulator, correlate with wind tunnel and CFD data, run the setup on track then change one number and all the data points agree,” he says.
“We are forever chasing an optimal model of the physical world” Matt Harris, Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport
This is the concept of a digital twin, a term used in heavy industry to describe a digital representation of a physical machine. But a true digital representation of a Formula One car is almost impossible, says Harris.
“It is almost impossible for us to get to, but what we want to get is to do P1 [the first practice session during a race weekend], learn from the conditions, understand where the software simulation was incorrect, and redo the simulation. We are forever chasing an optimal model of the physical world, minute to minute, hour to hour, day to day, from qualifying to racing.”
This iterative process continues after the race. It is updated post-race, and as and when improvements are made to the race car.
Read more about data-driven business Data is the new oil – but without tight control, how can business determine that the data is valid? Data catalogues are back in vogue.
Crafting a data strategy is hard. Use cases help. At the MIT CIO Symposium, four IT leaders share how they are forging data-driven strategie s that will pay off in the algorithmic economy.
Harris says Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport is working with Tibco on a project to look at how to feed the performance data from the car’s telemetry systems into time series databases, which can be used to visualise different datasets to identify anomalies and correlations.
The project represents a big step forward for the team in the ability to analyse data, he says. “This will be a massive step-change for next year. It’s hard to look at car [telemetry] data. There are thousands of channels of data.”
Harris says there is so much data that engineers need to know which dataset they should be looking at and what they are looking for in that dataset. “You only know what to look for if you know it’s an important piece of information,” he says. “With Tibco Spotfire, we will get trends on channels. A quick win will be the ability to look for anomalous activities.”
Data is essential on and off the track. Given the cost caps in Formula One, the team needs to know it is spending money in the right areas. Harris says: “We have different ways to do scheduling, production orders and programmes to manufacture the car.”

The ultimate goal of the hyperloop concept is to achieve a mode of transportation that is high speed, intercontinental and self-propelled. Such a system would both revolutionise the experience of transportation and offer a greener alternative to other modes of travel.
The Hyperloop Pod Competition, which started in 2015 as the brainchild of Elon Musk, culminates with a weeklong competition each summer in Hawthorne, California, located in southwestern Los Angeles. Over the course of the competition week, participants get to test their hyperloop pod designs on a mile-long track (Figure 1) at speeds of approximately 500 km per hour.
Working alongside the world’s top engineers
Each year, the top 20 teams worldwide are invited to the California testing facility and the top three teams can run on the track under vacuum at the final event. As a first-time competitor, EPFLoop exceeded all expectations by making a presence in the finale as one of the three teams to run in vacuum that year. Even more impressive was the fact that they classified first at the end of the testing week and were told that their pod showed the highest design reliability. Overall, the EPFLoop team ended up placing third in the high-speed run on the final day of the competition due to the unexpected presence of dust on the test track, which affected their pod’s performance. Their experience at SpaceX proved to be invaluable for many reasons.
Made up of engineering students and technical advisors, the EPFLoop competition team formed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). Dr. Mario Paolone, principal advisor of the EPFLoop team, says that the Hyperloop Pod Competition is a “chance for students and young engineers to participate in a state-of-the-art challenge, with some of the world’s top engineers.” Besides the chance to use high-tech testing equipment and rub elbows with professional engineers, the experience is a great opportunity for students to learn the importance of researching energy-efficient modes of transportation. It also gets students excited about research and inspires them to pursue careers in engineering.
Simulating the hyperloop pod
Aside from the opportunity to visit SpaceX and experience an advanced testing facility, the students who participate in EPFLoop have something more to gain: valuable experience using multiphysics simulation. Each aspect of EPFLoop’s hyperloop pod design (Figure 2) involves modelling and simulation. In fact, Paolone calls simulation the “core” of their project. One obvious reason: The team’s 60-meter test track is nowhere close to the mile-long test track at SpaceX. Consequently, even if their tests confirmed the results of the simulations at low speeds, they still relied on simulation software to gain insight into what will happen at very high speeds. “Every single component of the pod has to be simulated and validated,” says Dr. Lorenzo Benedetti, the technical leader of EPFLoop
Using the COMSOL Multiphysics® software, the EPFLoop team was able to analyse the complex components of their hyperloop pod and predict its performance before ever setting foot on the SpaceX premises. Furthermore, the team needed to be able to look at multiple physical effects at once, including mechanical, fluid, electrical and materials science phenomena. “This project is inherently multidisciplinary,” says Benedetti. For example, the design team wanted to see how the pod’s aeroshell, made out of a lightweight composite carbon fiber, would fare on the test track. To minimise the aerodynamic resistance of the shell, they performed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis coupled with shape optimisation and mechanical stress studies (Figure 3).
The aeroshell had to be both lightweight and able to withstand aerodynamic forces during acceleration and deceleration. The team used the High Mach Number Flow interface to find the lift and drag coefficients of the pod. The pressure distribution results from the CFD analysis were then used to find an optimised aerodynamic shape via the LiveLink™ for MATLAB® interfacing product.
The team also needed to see how the pod’s pressure vessel would perform in the tube, under vacuum, during the high-speed run. They designed vacuum-proof enclosures, which are responsible for storing the batteries and electrical components of the pod. In fact, some electronics cannot sustain vacuum conditions, and a subpar design could cause the inner components to be directly exposed to the track — which is essentially a vacuum tube — and destruct. The team performed a structural analysis of the vessel’s design, a composite pressure vessel, using the Shell interface in the COMSOL® software to account for the superposition of layers. They then optimised the structural response to be able to have the minimum weight possible. The Tsai–Wu safety factor and principal stresses were then studied in the optimised pod design.
Sliding to a stop
The hyperloop’s braking system is another example of multiphysics design. The brakes need to be able to safely slow the pod down after it has reached its top speed. However, there is an extreme temperature increase in the braking system due to the vacuum conditions in the tube: Without air, there is no convective dissipation of heat to the air and the heat remains stored in the brake pads. To ensure that the braking components would perform as expected, the EPFLoop team coupled heat transfer and mechanical simulations for their brake system design (Figure 4).
Using the Heat Transfer in Solids interface, the team analysed the temperature profile in the brake system during and after braking to ensure that it would not become hot enough to cause damage to the hyperloop pod. They then used the Translational Motion feature to estimate the power dissipation caused by the friction, and therefore, the temperature rise in the brakes. Using this information, the team performed a material sweep of the different brake pad options, including ones made out of leather, thermoplastic polyurethane, plaster and some more classical braking pad materials used in the automotive industry. The simulation analysis helped the team to identify that a customised material created for them by an external company was the best material option for the brake pads because it kept the braking system within the desired temperature range.
The team’s detailed simulation work paid off: “One of the judges called our approach ‘extremely compelling’,” says Benedetti.
Life-shaping experiences
The most impressive aspect of EPFLoop is not their pod design or competition ranking, but the project’s impact on the students who participated. Nicolò Riva, a PhD student at EPFL who also heads the team’s aerodynamics group, said that the experience made him “want to stay in academia and participate in similar projects.” Zsófia Sajó, another student involved in the 2018 competition team, said that EPFLoop inspired her to “do something about solar power and clean energy for transportation.”
Paolone’s impression of the project echoes the takeaways of his team members. He said that students set aside their personal and free time to participate in EPFLoop with motivation, drive and commitment. “We need these kinds of people,” he said, to be engaged in designing clean modes of transportation for the future.

Kelly Racing will head to the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 with a revised aerodynamic package on its four Nissan Altimas.
Supercars’ technical department has signed off on the latest tweak, intended to offer a small drag reduction without impacting downforce.
The change comes in the form of the addition of an outboard bootlid extension, incorporating a continued gurney across the full width of the boot.
It is the third change to the Altima in 2019, following a re-homologation over the off-season and a further revision ahead of The Bend in August.
The new-for-2019 Ford Mustang and the ZB Commodore have also undergone changes during the season in Supercars’ quest for technical parity.
Supercars’ Head of Motorsport Adrian Burgess confirmed the latest change will come into effect immediately.
“The Supercars Technical Department received an application from Kelly Racing for an aerodynamic adjustment following the most recent event at Pukekohe,” he said.

“Upon assessing the application and the information supplied, the Technical Department approved the submission as the delegated authority of the Supercars Commission.
“This adjustment will be in effect from the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 onwards.”
A new gurney will extend across the full width of the boot
Following its development in CFD [Computational Fluid Dynamics], Kelly Racing tested the latest change during its pre-Bathurst test at Winton on Tuesday.
Although not able to detect an improvement at the low-speed Victorian venue, team owner Todd Kelly hopes it’ll provide a minor gain on the straights at Bathurst.
This year is the seventh for the Altima in Supercars racing, fighting to be competitive with Ford Mustang and ZB Commodore.
“There’s really nothing left in our cars. With that body shape and the way it’s been designed, it’s pretty much tapped out,” Kelly told Supercars.com.
“In CFD there is a very small gain with the latest change, a slight amount less drag with the same downforce, but it’s absolutely splitting hairs in the CFD.
“At Winton, we did three back-to-back runs and we couldn’t tell the difference in driver feedback, lap time or the data.
“But given there’s a very small difference in CFD and it didn’t show up as anything negative at Winton, we’re quite keen to just bank it and hope that it shows up at 300km/h at Bathurst.
“It’s splitting hairs, but it’s worth splitting hairs when we’re going to the fastest track we race on.”
Kelly Racing has three new driver combinations for Bathurst this year, with Simona De Silvestro and Alex Rullo its only carryover pairing.

A total of 12 renewable energy projects were given the go-ahead at the Contract for Difference allocation round.
The latest round of Contract for Difference energy awards signalled a blow for island interconnectors despite some onshore wind farms gaining consent.
A total of 12 new renewable electricity projects won CfDs across offshore wind, advanced conversion technologies and remote island wind sectors, which will deliver almost 5.8GW of power to the grid by 2025.
Costa Head and Hesta Head were among the onshore projects to succeed, with the two Orkney schemes operated by Hoolan Energy, part of Low Carbon, providing around 40MW of power to the islands.
However, Ofgem's conditional approval for the interconnetor requires a total of 135MW of new projects by December 2021.
Steve Mack, head of investments at Low Carbon, said: “We have been developing Costa Head and Hesta Head for almost five years and are delighted to secure CfD contracts for both projects. We look forward to the other Orkney projects completing their development, thus enabling construction of the interconnector to start as soon as possible.”
Muaitheabhail and Druim Leathann wind farms in Lewis were also awarded contracts, but Lewis Wind Power's Stornoway project – which has been the subject of a dispute over crofters' rights in the courts – was unsuccessful.
Gavin MacKay, head of energy industries at Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: “This news represents a step in the right direction towards interconnection for Orkney with the successful award of Hoolan Energy’s two projects. Ofgem’s conditionality still requires a further 100MW of new generation to come forward by December 2021 to justify investment in the cable for Orkney.
Gavin MacKay of HIE: 'Transmission links to the islands are vital.'
“However, there is disappointment as other island projects – Stornoway wind farm in Lewis and Viking Energy in Shetland did not receive CfD awards after a huge amount of work by the teams.
“The combined capacity of the successful Lewis projects is not enough to meet the conditions of building the Western Isles Interconnector. Transmission links to the islands are vital to ensure that the Northern and Western Isles can continue to play a vital and strategic role in the UK energy mix for the decades to come.”
Lewis Wind Power said it would consider its options after the result.
Director Mark Vyvyan-Robinson said: “Obviously, we are all incredibly disappointed not to have secured a Contract for Difference after a huge amount of work by the team to make the project as competitive as possible.
“We now need to take some time to look at all the options for the project, and to assess what we believe to be the best way forward for the wind farm and we will keep our partners and the local community updated as we work our way through these.”
The four community energy companies seeking to develop renewables on common grazings in Lewis said a new approach was needed to developing renewables in the islands, putting the community at its heart.
Representing Sandwick North, Sandwick East, Melbost Branahuie and Aignish Community Energy companies, Rhoda Mackenzie said: “Comhairle nan Eilean Siar and the Stornoway Trust have always argued that the Lewis Wind Power wind farm was essential to get a new interconnector to the Western Isles.
“The logic of that argument is that the interconnector cannot now happen, given LWP’s failure in the subsidy auction.
“We believe it is time now for a new approach. There is still plenty of scope to develop renewables on the islands but we need to do so in a way that puts community-owned energy front and centre.
Representatives of the four community energy companies in Lewis (from left) Angus Campbell of Melbost Branahuie, Donnie MacDonald of Aignish, Rhoda Mackenzie of Sandwick North and Calum Buchanan of Sandwick East. Picture: Sandie Maciver
“The right way forward is to increase the capacity of the existing grid via new demand through electrification and hydrogen, install new storage via battery, and start working on an upgrade of the existing Skye connector.
“It is essential that the new Plan B is built around, by and for community-owned energy, as that is the only way to keep the income and profits in the islands.
“The Comhairle must not see the CfD outcome as a defeat but as an opportunity for them to take the lead in developing a new partnership with the community energy companies in the islands to work together and to unite around a new Plan B.”
Viking Energy Shetland said it was very disappointed in the outcome but that it remained committed to the project and will look at ways to deliver the wind farm.
Spokesman Aaron Priest said: “Shetland needs to reap the benefits of its world-class renewable energy resources. Shetland’s economy is over-dependent on oil and gas and has a fundamental need to diversify.
“Future generations in Shetland deserve the chance to utilise our abundant clean energy resources to create a new industry, jobs and prosperity in this community. We want to build a Shetland economy that is truly sustainable.”
Trade body Scottish Renewables said including onshore island wind farms in this CfD round would help to boost communities in remote areas.
Its chief executive Claire Mack said: “Scotland’s islands have some of the best wind resource in Europe and the decision to award contracts to four projects today will mean economic, social and environmental benefits for communities in the Western Isles and Orkney.
“The record-low prices which have been achieved also mean more value for consumers, with island wind matching the price achieved by offshore projects.
Claire Mack, chief executive, Scottish Renewables.
“Scottish Renewables was proud to work closely with island councils and the Scottish Government to secure access to the Contracts for Difference mechanism for remote island onshore wind projects last year, and this announcement is a testament to those efforts.”
Elsewhere, the Moray West offshore wind farm – planned to add to a cluster of farms in the Outer Moray Firth alongside the completed Beatrice wind farm and the consented Moray East project – failed to secure a CfD allocation in this round.
However, the company confirmed that the project remains viable and it hoped to bid again in 2021, with construction to begin in 2024.
Dan Finch, Moray West director, said: “Despite this setback, it is a significant achievement to get the project to such an advanced stage in a short period of time. Moray West will continue to develop the project in anticipation of the next auction round and thank our suppliers for helping us deliver a highly competitive bid, and with whom we will continue to work to drive the cost-reduction agenda.
“We continue to look forward to taking Moray West into its construction phase and delivering significant economic opportunities for Scotland and the UK.
“We’re confident that Moray West is able to become a key piece of Scotland’s energy transition story. There is an opportunity for Scotland’s energy targets to be met in future by Scottish offshore wind farms and for Moray West to be a key step on that journey.”
HIE's Mr MacKay added: “While we are disappointed that the Moray West project did not proceed in the timeframe of this round, we look forward to continuing with positive engagement as the project is enhanced for future allocation rounds.
Moray West is planned in the Outer Moray Firth beside the consented Moray East wind farm.
"The prevalence of offshore wind project success in the south of the UK underlines the criticality of having a competitive manufacturing supply chain in the region to supply components to projects clustered around the east of England.
“This allocation round demonstrates just how competitive remote island and offshore wind has become. Participation in the UK electricity market is the big prize both for place based, sustainable and inclusive economic growth opportunities. It also underpins the valuable contribution our region can make to a secure, sustainable, decarbonised UK energy system in our transition to net-zero carbon.
“We will work proactively with all stakeholders to understand the implications and work towards a solution for connecting the islands. Feedback received from island and offshore developers so far has been positive about optimising projects and bidding in the next allocation round.”

The Bloodhound Land Speed Record (LSR) car has reached the final phase of its build program as the team prepares the car for a trip to South Africa. Here, it will be put through its paces in a series of high-speed shakedowns on the Hakskeenpan desert in the Northern Cape.
This will be the most extreme test to date as the Bloodhound LSR car builds speed over 13 runs in steady 50mph (80km/h) increments between mid-October and mid-November, culminating in speeds in excess of 500mph (800km/h).

Bloodhound CEO Ian Warhurs, commented, “I’ve really enjoyed watching the team rise to the challenge over these past six months. Something which has been talked about and planned for so long is now really happening – and the team have taken it in their stride. Our fantastic new location in the center of a technical college at UTC Berkeley has really helped the project come alive – the project is now in new territory.
“It’s also very important to remember that the team in South Africa have also risen to the challenge. After so much work and several false starts, the Northern Cape Provincial Government didn’t hesitate to re-engage and have worked quickly and efficiently to help us finalize agreements and then mobilize the local workforce. This in return has brought much needed employment to the area to help us clear and prepare the track.
“So that’s it – we are off to South Africa to start putting the car through its paces. This is engineering at its best and I look forward to everyone joining us online as the action unfolds this autumn.”
Final preparations
Prior to departure, one of the final installation checks of the car’s state-of-the-art engine is to ‘dry crank’ it, checking all the systems are correct and working perfectly. This involves running through the startup sequence and turning it over with no fuel or ignition.
A dry crank test is a crucial stage of the pre-testing program as it confirms the engine and all its ancillary systems, fuel and electrics are correctly installed and ready to fire up once the car is in the full system test, confirming the engine can be started.
To perform the test, the team will use an air start cart (a small jet engine) to blow high-pressure air into the onboard aircraft mounted accessories drive (AMAD) gearbox, which will both spin the jet’s turbine up to required speed and, once spinning, generate three-phase AC power for the car, which then sends power to the jet engine’s fuel pumps.
Bloodhound LSR engineering director, Mark Chapman, said, “Transforming Bloodhound from a runway spec car to one capable of reaching speeds in the transonic range on the desert racetrack has been no small task. The team of engineers, craftsmen, fabricators and technicians have pulled out all the stops to upgrade the car in just a few months since the rescue from administration last December.
“After many years in preparation, we can’t wait to get out to the Hakskeenpan and let Bloodhound off the leash to see just how it performs.”
﻿
Bloodhound’s departure
Moving the 6.4 metric ton Bloodhound LSR 5,500 miles (9,000km) from the UK to South Africa presents a raft of logistical challenges in itself.
Much of the heavy support equipment, including the car’s trailer, has already been shipped by sea, but the car itself will travel via air freight to ensure it isn’t subjected to any uncontrolled shock loads that could damage it in transit.
The EJ200 jet engine will travel mounted inside the upper chassis, which is where it would be found it in its natural home inside the Eurofighter Typhoon. The 2m-high tail fin, which is the same size as that found on a Red Arrows display jet, has been removed and will travel upright in a wooden crate, along with some sections of the composite bodywork.
The car will be fitted with the wheels shod with pneumatic tires that were used for UK runway testing at Cornwall Airport, Newquay, in October 2017, where they carried the car at speeds of up to 200mph (320km/h).
For testing in South Africa, the wheels will be changed from pneumatic to solid aluminium discs to cope with the high speeds and desert environment. The 90kg (198 lb) desert wheels are produced by a consortium of partners including Castle Precision Engineering.
The test program
This stage of the testing process is crucial, as the 300-500mph window is one of the most vulnerable stages for the car. It’s at this point that the stability of the car transitions from being governed by the interaction of the wheels with the desert surface to being controlled by the vehicle’s aerodynamics. The grip from the wheels will fade faster than the aerodynamic forces build up, so this is likely to be the point where the car is at its least stable.
The high speed test program will also be a full dress rehearsal for the record-breaking campaign, with the team using the time to develop their operational procedures, perfect their practices for desert working, and test radio communications.
Data on the interaction between the aluminum wheels, which are being used for the first time, coupled with ‘base drag’ measurements, will provide real-world insight into the power required to set records. Base drag relates to the aerodynamic force produced by low pressure at the rear of the car, sucking it back. As the car approaches transonic speeds, this force far exceeds the friction of the air passing over Bloodhound’s bodywork.
Assistant aerospace engineering professor Ben Evans, from Swansea University, and PhD student Jack Townsend, will join the Bloodhound team in the desert to help analyze the gigabytes of performance data from each of the runs. They will be comparing the real data against the predicted CFD models to see how closely they marry up. A key aim of these tests is to provide valuable data allowing the refinement of the CFD models, which will in turn improve the accuracy of future modeling. Bloodhound engineers will use the data to validate the next run profile, allowing safe increments in speed as the real vehicle data is compared with its ‘digital twin’.
During low-speed trials in 2017, driver Andy Green drove the previously blue and orange liveried car from a standing start to 200mph in 8 seconds on the 1.6-mile (2.7km) runway at Cornwall Airport, Newquay. Now, with 10 miles (16km) of perfectly flat Kalahari Desert, the Bloodhound LSR team will be able to push the car much harder and get an accurate picture of how it behaves at much higher speeds.

The CFD is in the process of relocating some of their city-managed needle boxes based on data collected between March and May, which helped them identify which areas in Calgary have a greater need for them.
“We recognized the need for added needle debris boxes, identified priority locations and are working on the immediate installation in these areas,” Bergeson explained.
According to the city, there are 22 needle debris boxes that are managed by the CFD, and “up to five” are going to be either re-located or added.
In total, the city said 22,469 needles were cleared in Calgary between January and the end of August.
Alpha House’s Needle Response Team can be reached at 403-796-5334 (call or text) or via email at needle@alphahousecalgary.com from Monday – Friday, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
After hours, the fire department is available to clear needles from public property, or needles that pose safety risk on private property.

THE operators of the Moray West offshore wind farm have insisted that the project remains viable despite failing to win a Contract for Difference (CfD) as part of the UK Government’s latest CfD auction.
The offshore wind farm, led by a joint venture company combining EDP Renewables and ENGIE, said it had placed competitive bids "on a range of scenarios".
It is looking to install as many as 85 turbines with a rotor diameter of up to 250m in the outer Moray Firth, some 22km off the Caithness coast.
Construction had been expected to begin in 2022 but that has now been put back to 2024.
Moray West was one of what were understood to be eight offshore wind bidders in the auction, alongside other eligible technology projects. Against a cap of 6GW, six awards have been offered to offshore wind project applicants.
Moray West gained consent licenses this summer.
The project team said it recognised an opportunity for Moray West to be awarded a CfD in the next auction round in 2021 “and would be on course for start of construction in 2024”.

Moray West director Dan Finch said: “Despite this setback, it is a significant achievement to get the project to such an advanced stage in a short period. Moray West will continue to develop the project in anticipation of the next auction round and thank our suppliers for helping us deliver a highly competitive bid, and with whom we will continue to work to drive the cost reduction agenda.
“I would also like to thank both internal and external stakeholders involved in getting Moray West offshore wind farm to this stage. Without their support we would not have been able to prepare the project for a strong bid.
"We continue to look forward to taking Moray West into its construction phase and delivering significant economic opportunities for Scotland and the UK.
“We’re confident that Moray West is able to become a key piece of Scotland’s energy transition story. There is an opportunity for Scotland’s energy targets to be met in future by Scottish offshore wind farms and for Moray West to be a key step on that journey.
“The project also shows how two leaders in the industry, EDPR and ENGIE, can work together to develop low-cost renewable electricity.
“We also remain confident in the CfD process and recognise the mechanism’s importance in keeping prices down.”

CHICAGO (WLS) -- The I-Team has learned that the Chicago Fire Department is conducting an internal investigation after first responders mistakenly left a Chicago grandfather for dead on his apartment floor this past February.Whitfield Marshall, 64, was a car mechanic and a U.S. Marine. After Gabray Carter got the call that his grandfather had died, Carter and his girlfriend went to Marshall's apartment to see him one last time before the funeral home picked up his body."The apartment is so small, so she opened the door and went in but I could see from the door that he was on the ground," said Carter.Julia Morris went in first and saw that Marshall was still moving - so she called out his name."He was moving his arms," said Carter. "I was terrified. I was actually terrified because my best friend was laying on the ground! Helpless!""It was crazy you know? It was something I never saw ever in life, you know? I was panicking," said Morris. "I didn't know what to do, I just wanted him to get help right then and there."The couple is in training to become paramedics and they said Marshall was moving and moaning. They called 911 and found his pulse."There's no way he could be moving if he's dead, so I just knew he was alive. He needed help," said Morris."If I was in that situation, I definitely would have been able to save him if I was the EMT who came the first time" said Carter.Chicago Fire Department records show it had been more than three and half hours since the first team of paramedics left.When EMS arrived the second time, they took Marshall, breathing and with a weak pulse, to the waiting ambulance. As they rushed him to Stroger Hospital, he had a heart attack.Three days later the family decided to take Marshall off of life support."It is certain. They took his chance away from him," said the family's attorney Dan Biederman. "He laid on that floor for three and a half hours struggling and it's absolutely clear had they gotten him to that hospital earlier, his chances of surviving were much much greater."Records from the first ambulance run say the crew found Marshall "face down hard, cold, with blood pooling on his whole front side." EMS told the police he was DOA - Dead On Arrival. There are no notations showing any kind of medical exam or attempted treatment."It's stunning that this happened," said Biederman. "Why those paramedics left, those paramedics didn't examine him? If Julia could feel a heartbeat three and a half hours later they clearly didn't feel for a heartbeat, they never should have left that apartment."After the incident, the paramedics involved were immediately suspended for two weeks and were retrained. They're now back on the job as the fire department continues an internal investigation. That investigation could eventually lead to additional discipline or even potential firings.Marshall's family is now suing the city for failing to treat or transport him to the hospital the first time, leaving him for dead."I want to get justice for my grandfather," said Carter. He says the man he called his "best friend" and "role model" would want him "to do anything in my power to make sure that this didn't happen to anyone else in the City of Chicago."A CFD spokesman says department officials hold "emergency personnel to the highest level of professional standards and take seriously our duty to address misconduct" and they "are committed to holding accountable any emergency personnel who have fallen short of their duty."The I-Team has learned that the Illinois Department of Public Health is also investigating the incident.

The FIA has revealed the requirements Formula 1 teams will need to adhere to in order to produce unrestricted CFD simulations for the planned 2021 aerodynamics regulations.
In December's World Motor Sport Council meeting, the FIA announced that the limit on CFD development for current specification cars would be lifted - albeit only for work carried out for the expected 2021 rules.
This has been confirmed in the latest issue of the sporting regulations, released on Thursday, explaining the conditions in which teams will be permitted to carry out development for the future technical ruleset.
At the FIA's discretion, teams will be afforded non-restricted CFD development "on an equitable and transparent basis", although such development is completely optional.
In advance of producing simulations, teams must provide a list of flow and boundary conditions before the FIA approves its extra use of CFD resources.
This includes the geometry of the parts to be tested, along with any mathematical models and conditions within the simulation to ensure transparency.
Teams will also be required to provide full reports of simulations to the FIA and to the other teams, on the proviso that no intellectual property is shared between parties.
Ultimately, the research and development carried out in the unrestricted simulations will assist the FIA's technical team shape the 2021 ruleset, expected to be a continuation of the changes brought in for next season.
There is a previous precedent to this, with teams afforded extra CFD time when working to the 2019 regulations after they were revealed, as F1 also provided an input with its own in-house technical researchers.
Next year's cars will have larger front wings, extended by 200mm in width and 25mm in depth, while the rear wings will be 70mm taller and wider.
DRS will also be more effective, and the upper rear wing flap will open up by an extra 20mm when activated.
Further changes to the sporting regulations include a 5kg increase in the maximum fuel limit, rising from 105kg to 110kg.

The initial consultation period closed on 1 October 2019, allowing brokers and other relevant stakeholders to provide feedback on the proposed changes.

You can read the statement regarding CMC Markets’ submission here.

Final decisions surrounding intervention on these products will likely be announced by ASIC from late October 2019.


Story 24
A man suffered cuts and bruises and his dog required a stretcher after the two were unable to exit from a heavily-wooded area in a southwest neighbourhood.
Members of the Calgary Fire Department's High-Angle Rescue Team were deployed to a ravine along Patterson Boulevard S.W., in the community of Patterson, at around 10 p.m. Wednesday following reports a dog and its owner were stuck.
Officials say the two had been out for a walk when the dog got loose and the owner followed it into the treed ravine.
Firefighters rappelled into the ravine and retrieved the pair, with the dog being brought out on a stretcher.
"We got really lucky," recounted Captain Roger Smith of the CFD High Angle Rescue team. "It was difficult searching in the dark. We had some assistance from HAWCS which was beneficial because they could light up the area so it assisted trying to find him."
EMS responded to the scene, and firefighters conduct the rescue under the advisement of a veterinarian, but neither the dog nor its owner required additional medical attention.

Willem Toet explains…CFD Post Processing
Welcome to the first of a three-part series by former Head of Aerodynamics at Benetton, Ferrari and Sauber F1, Professor Willem Toet, who exclusively explains CFD Post Processing in depth.
01. Don’t you just love the ability of CFD to “picture” what’s happening with airflow? I’ve only been playing with aerodynamics for about 40 years, CFD just over 25 years, and it still gets me going. CFD images have often been called “Colours For Directors” – these ones are absolutely based on calculated airflow but are not particularly useful for developmental analysis – however, they make great images for showing some aspects of what’s happening with airflow. Add a verbal explanation and everyone should be able to understand what’s being show. INTRODUCTION Here I will give some indications about post-processing to those willing and able to set up CFD cases. This article focuses on analysing results. I am not able to share with you the lastest analysis techniques used in Sauber or indeed by top CFD experts, but I can give you some basic guidance about where to start. Advice on setting up cases can be found via CFD vendors and will differ depending on the code you choose. Before you delve into post-processing you will need to dig deeply enough into CFD to know how to split your model, set up domains, meshing strategies, turbulence models etc. However, I see so many people struggling with processing what they have already run in CFD research, that I thought I would start here. I use race cars as my subject, but the concepts discussed can be used with any sort of fluid dynamic simulation program. I’m not showing everything here, but things I know to be in the public domain (if you know where to look).
I am a strong believer in CFD. I think it is the most cost-effective way of developing complex aerodynamic devices. If, that is, it’s done well using trusted methods and, with enough high-quality cells in the mesh, a good turbulence model. This requires specialist knowledge or very good advice. My friend Riccardo Pagliarella correctly pointed out that “CFD can allow interrogation of flow phenomena not easily visualised by experimental means”. In F1 these days each team has a group of people dedicated to correlating research methods to reality – so F1 teams generally have a pretty good understanding of the strengths and limitations of the CFD tools they use. From what I’ve seen, even some university student teams (F-SAE, Formula Student) have a very good handle on this so I felt it was time to share my thoughts about the analysis of CFD results. If you go to the trouble of doing CFD, then it would be silly to ignore a case just because the numbers are a bit worse than the last case or something has changed that you did not want / expect. Spending some real time on the analysis of the results and understanding what the flow is doing, try to understand the flow mechanisms at play. Convergence History and Residuals Solving CFD cases is done by a process of computational iteration and the convergence history will already tell you a lot. If convergence is erratic (in F1 we’re always pushing the boundaries) then you have unstable flow somewhere or a CFD setup-related problem. Pay attention to that or you will be creating a problem for your beloved new aerodynamic object. Real-world conditions often involve changes that will push flow far from the ideal of a single CFD attitude, so instabilities should be avoided. If instability in a RANS case seems cyclic, and you want to understand why/where (you should always want to understand!), then you can use this cyclic (unsteady) behaviour to understand more. A good trick is to run the calculation on to an expected “high” point, conduct full post-processing, run on to a predicted “low” point and repeat full post-processing. Comparing the two sets of post-processing can tell you about the area of sensitivity.
Convergence characteristics can be linked to physical aero phenomena.
• Faster convergence may imply authority over wake structures
• Long-scale oscillations could be a sign of cyclic separation and reattachment
• Short-scale oscillations could be signs of wandering separation lines and these could just be unstable wheel wakes
• Sudden drop in downforce could be a sign of a vortex bursting (happens in reality)
It is also possible to record the standard deviation of the pressure (fluctuation) acting on the surfaces of the body you are researching. Small variations for RANS and bigger (more realistic) using DES. In time, you will learn much more from this simple looking series of plots (which can include the convergence history for sub-components). For example, if one sub-component in your vehicle shows big oscillation then the airflow nearby or the shape of that component probably needs attention. My friend Torbjörn Larsson at Creo Dynamics (he’s an ex-head of CFD at Sauber and Ferrari) commented: “Regarding convergence history, looking at force convergence as you describe is of course very sensible. I´d also say, don´t forget to check the flow residuals. I´ve experienced cases that show very nice and (expected) behaviour in terms of force convergence but for some reason exhibit a different characteristic while looking at flow residuals. If one case converges well in terms of forces but struggles to converge in flow residuals something may be odd. This could be related to the “beauty of” RANS (e.g. avoid symmetry conditions, ½ cars are typically not a good idea albeit very tempting to run to save cells.)” For projects where I paid out of my own pocket or managed the project myself, half-car symmetry cases were few and far between. Post-processing should certainly include a breakdown of the forces on the vehicle and many sub-components as well as many ‘standard’ images. It’s perfectly possible to pull the solution into the memory of a very powerful computer and to look at the flow in lots of ways manually. Old-fashioned CFD experts used to do this (manually). It is a great way to learn. However, if you want to compare a lot of cases then this isn’t a good long-term strategy. I suggest agreeing a list of standard images. Sticking to a set of a standard set of post-processing information and images will make it easier to compare cases in the future. It is also more time efficient – despite the time it will take initially. So what numerical data do you need? I ask for things like the case setup summary, including simulation speed, front and rear ride heights, yaw, roll and steer angles. Then, overall downforce, side force, drag, force distribution, and a breakdown of drag and downforce on lots of components. Also important can be things like radiator and brake cooling flows, pressure of the air heading for the engine intake etc. The forces should be averaged over a pre-determined number of final iterations to smooth out fluctuations seen during the final stages of convergence. Automate the creation of “Standard” Post-Processing information When you first learn to use CFD for aerodynamic development or understanding, it is correct that you create some bespoke post-processing images. There are many packages available and I cannot tell you which is best. I am a strong believer in open-source packages and several F1 teams use these. They are not as easy to use sometimes as commercial codes but there is no monster fee to pay. For any group of people or even an individual doing development work, the benefits of doing the same analysis on each case you run are large. So, I suggest you automate your post-processing as much as you can. Write a script to extract the same information and images from every case you run. For some of the more minor private fun (home) projects I’ve done, this means well over 1000 images per case. In F1 this means more than 10,000 images. I only go for high-quality images. Today this means 4k and above, in the past it was a bit less. Disks are low cost compared to your time – so store the images. The creation of standard post-pro takes time. A great little project for someone. If you are with a university Formula Student / SAE team, then this can be a specific task for a student interested in coding and in using it for a useful purpose. Once done, every person trying to do CFD has a head start and is able to start thinking like an aerodynamicist. Resolving Forces – reference axis What’s the best reference for calculating forces? An aircraft flying in free stream will react to forces and moments about its nominal centre of gravity position. Forces may react on a car at any height, but they are ultimately reacted through the contact patches on the ground.
Images 05a and 05b – the impact of the centre of pressure of drag and side force on the calculated value for front to rear centre of pressure. Resolving about the contact patches, normal (downforce) and parallel (drag, side force) to the ground, simplifies your understanding of where forces are acting. That is the appropriate way to calculate aerodynamic balance for a ground vehicle. External Overview Images So, what are the most useful images? While I can’t show you everything, here are a few of the image types that I’ve found to be the most useful. Images of your vehicle or object external shape viewed in different orientations is a good starting point. The more (consistent, representative) orientations you pick the more comparative analysis you can do, within reason.
08. Here is the style of and number of object orientations that I would consider to be a minimum. Images are of a GT-type car but the type of object does not matter, thinking about what you may want to see and being consistent are what matter.
Quite a few experts prefer this way of showing the forces acting on a car. I like to show a ‘dead band’ in a neutral colour, such as the grey in these images, that then allows the areas making the biggest direct contribution to drag or downforce (or any other parameter) to be highlighted. Regrettably, aerodynamics is extremely interactive so you can’t simply remove the parts that are high drag and expect the remainder of the flow to stay the same. That would be just too easy! By the way, there is no limit to the parameters you choose or the scale you wish to show. For example, you could show a front overturning moment and colour to that (have done that in the past). Any important parameter you want to visualise could be plotted in this way. These are images of the Empire Wraith hillclimb car. Images courtesy of TotalSim. Make sure you consider your colour scale. Keep your first few cases and use these to refine your processes including the colour scale. The grey scale can be anywhere in the range – or you can leave it out altogether. The colour steps can be fairly coarse, so you can pick specific transitions of the parameter you’re studying, or they can be fine (which personally, I prefer).
18. CpT-Wall is total pressure (energy is another description) near the visible surfaces of the vehicle. Red represents high CpT and blue low CpT. Normalised UW – blue to dark green with this colour scale means the air is moving slowly, while yellow to red means the air is moving quickly. The value 1 means air is travelling at free-stream velocity.
19 & 20. Normalised UW (basically velocity ratio [to vehicle velocity] near the surface and in the direction of the surface) – this tells you a lot about how the air is behaving near the surface, both in terms of rapid changes of velocity but also warns you where the air is almost stopped near the surface. Note the impact of the suspension on airflow near the body (will have the same impact away from the body). The lower picture also has simulated oil flow lines added which can be useful. The simulated oil flow uses LIC (line integral convolution) for those of you who are interested in researching the maths behind this. I really like LIC plots. These give you ways of comparing CFD to real “oil” flow on the race car. It takes a great deal of experience and patience to learn when flow should be basically simple and almost straight, and when it can be arranged in a much more complex way. Be aware as well that gravity plays a part in the flow directions on real cars – especially if the flow visualisation liquid is still very liquid and velocities are low. These plots can also provide you with a way of getting some correlation to reality. Need to understand more? Riccardo Pagliarella suggests looking up Critical Point Theory by Chong & Perry (about 1986). I also like to see any type of plot that shows shear stresses near the surface. Using External “Surface” Information for Analysis When searching for extremes of lift or downforce, a wing is sometimes pushed by experts to show some detached flow – typically on the trailing edge. There is a price to pay in terms of efficiency but often you can get more downforce with slight trailing edge separation – especially where rules limit the number of elements that can be used. Racing cars push the limits in order to gain more grip in corners, braking and acceleration. However, be very cautious about this because large areas of detachment or even extreme sideways flow are a clear warning sign (generally speaking). Think about what might happen if the flow is further strained – e.g. with mechanical vibration, wind gusts, a sudden change of vehicle pitch angle etc. Flow detaching from the trailing edge first is the main type of detachment that can sometimes be accepted. Another area is in a diffuser that is working on the limit where there is often a separation bubble – see my article about diffusers for more about that. Mid-element or leading-edge detachment should be avoided. These sorts of detachment can be “catastrophic” and will give the driver dramatic changes of feeling with small changes of attitude. If you’re learning and don’t have a big experienced team behind you, limit flow separation to tiny amounts right at the trailing edges of your most extreme devices. From Riccardo Pagliarella: “CFD calculations give very discrete views of a highly dynamic body, and some small investment in experimental instrumentation can be valuable here (e.g. a limited number of pressure taps on a suction surface)”
Here is a view from below a front wing where the flow is just recirculating at the trailing edge (lower part of the picture). This is not dangerous yet, but this wing should not be pushed too much further without a redesign. The case is run in yaw so there is a difference side to side. Note, also, how much angle is achieved for the air relative to the car – for example on the front wing end plates near to the leading edge of the tyre – this is partly responsible for the wing trailing edge recirculation. Any parts operating in ground effect or influenced by pitch or yaw should not be over developed for a single condition. Check for sensitivities to attitude / height. Normalised UW – blue to dark green means the air is moving slowly, while yellow to red means the air is moving quickly Aerodynamicists have often described a tyre jet, caused by the fact that the air can’t pass through the tyre combined with the slowing of the air inboard of the tyre caused by the presence of the wing (expansion slows the air towards the trailing edge of the wing). These tyre jets can be damaging to the flow around the remainder of the car if not managed.
22a and 22b. Upper image shows flow (Lamda2 coloured by CpT) vorticity coming off a car (in yaw). This image has been flipped so the vortex action can also be seen on the underside of the rear wing which is shown below. The rear wing underside shows normalised UW (near surface velocity ratio – red high speed to blue low speed) and simulated oil flow (LIC) The wing has mounts below it and the case has been run at 10.6 degrees of yaw. You can see that the mount plates are causing partial triangular areas of separation. This triangular pattern is “normal” in the circumstances and actually not too awful compared to many wings on race cars today. There is also a trailing edge separation on the wing main plane. This is also not what you’d want. The strange looking flow feature on the upper part of the picture is caused by a vortex that has rolled up from the sharp trailing edge of the engine cover in this extreme yaw case. Off-Body flow Visualisation
24a. Lamda2 (mathematical way of identifying vortices – I like to see iso surfaces coloured by a useful second parameter such as total pressure) is a convenient way of getting an overview of vorticity around an object. Every created vortex takes some energy out of the airflow but vortices can be extraordinarily powerful for managing airflow when physical devices are not appropriate or legal. They’ve been used in F1 to great effect and in a truly extreme way. The above picture of a hillclimb car can be contrasted with flow around a generic Formula 1 car of about 2012 vintage. Vorticity levels on the cars of 2017 and 2018 reached dramatic levels as rules in the area beside the front of the chassis were opened up – if you ever get the chance of seeing one of these cars physically (e.g. at a show) – have a close look. We’ve had so much fun with these!!!
24b. View of Lambda2 (vorticity) around an older generic Formula one car coloured by total pressure. Great type of image for getting an overview of vorticity and energy around a vortex, more challenging to use for highly detailed analysis. This case is run at about 12 degrees of yaw. Another type of analysis I find useful is to trace flow lines. For example, where has the air come from that will cool my brakes / radiators and where does it go to?

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Tuesday marks one year since the death of Chicago Fire Department diver Juan Bucio.Bucio, 46, was searching for a boater who fell into the Chicago River when he lost his life last Memorial Day weekend. More than 100 colleagues gathered Tuesday morning at the spot along the Chicago River where Bucio died while searching for a missing boater. Bucio's family, including his two sons, were also in attendance.The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office determined that Bucio died of a rare heart condition called lymphocytic myocarditis that can cause heart failure. His death was ruled an accident.Alberto Lopez, the man Bucio was searching for after he fell off a boat in the south branch of the river, also died.The memorial was organized by the Chicago Fire Department Gold Badge Society, which was founded by families of firefighters and paramedics who died in the line of duty."It's our way of paying forward because we don't want these new families to have to feel like we did," said Allyson Coglianese, whose father, Chicago fire lieutenant Edmond Coglianese, died while fighting a fire at the Mark Twain Hotel on Super Bowl Sunday 1986.The fire department dedicated a Scuba Dog statue at the fire academy in honor of Bucio, with his name and badge number on the wet suit. The design was a collaboration by Paul Boeckman and Bob Jones, who wanted to do their part to commemorate Bucio."We tried to do something that was interesting and different than most people have seen before," Boeckman said.A wreath in honor of Bucio's service was dropped into the river not far from where he lost his life.Bucio was a 15-year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department, spending the last 11 years on the Marine and Dive Operations Unit. Prior to CFD, Bucio was a Chicago police officer from 2000-2003, a police spokesman confirmed.Bucio was the 13th Chicago firefighter to die in the line of duty since 2000, according to the Illinois Fire Service Institute.

Story 29
ASIC has dropped a massive bombshell, officially proposing severe restrictions on CFD products, labeling them ‘detrimental to retail clients’ and preparing to restrict marketing methods and leverage. Is it all bad? Probably not. Here is our full report
Today marks the day when the inevitable actually came to fruition.
Ever since the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) completed its very comprehensive directive in the form of MiFID II which extended huge and detailed trading infrastructure regulations to all electronic trading entities ranging from ETFs to margin brokers, Australia’s non-bank financial markets regulator ASIC has been demonstrating signs that it may emulate the European rulings.
This has not happened, and ASIC is unlikely to emulate the European regulations in their entirety for two reasons, those being that ASIC is a regulatory authority that genuinely understands the FX and CFD industry properly, a facet that cannot be said of many other regulatory authorities worldwide, and perhaps more importantly, that ASIC has begun what can only really be described as a ‘clampdown’ in a completely different manner to that exercised by ESMA two years ago.
During interaction with Australian FX industry leaders over the past two years and certainly since the implementation of MiFID II in Europe, FinanceFeeds has been able to glean from opinion among senior executives that ASIC may potentially follow suit in terms of restructuring the means by which OTC trades are executed, reported and sold to retail customers, many of whom considered that leverage restrictions would be part of that remit.
Indeed, the speculation was correct and today ASIC has released a very detailed proposal in which the regulator demonstrates its clear intention to restrict the methods by which OTC CFDs are sold.
Currently, spot FX is not covered under the proposals, as ASIC has made its stance clear that, as far as regulatory research is concerned, its officials believe that a very high percentage of retail clients have been closed out of positions by their CFD provider automatically at low margin levels.
This differs tremendously from the MiFID II leverage and trade reporting stipulations in Europe, however the outcome is likely to be very similar in that leverage will be curtailed.
Australian retail FX and CFD brokerages are among the highest quality in the world, and are led by extremely experienced senior executives who have created a ‘halo effect’ within the entire industry globally in that most retail FX firms look to Australia as a bastion of success and good business ethic, and rightly so.
Many brokers in Australia have gained vast business via established networks of introducing brokers and affiliate partners across the nearby and very lucrative Asia Pacific region, largely due to a combination of perceived quality and Western business ethic by money managers and introducing brokers in Asia which combines with a close and well developed business relationship between Australia and the APAC nations, and the ability for clients to trade with 1:500 leverage whilst under the respectable auspices of ASIC which conducts real time surveillance on brokerages and has a technologically advanced approach to our very modern business sector.
Additionally, the world’s retail sector and its client base knows that Australian banks, infrastructure and business ethics are world class, with very few issues with retail firms, and those which have contravened being dealt with very severely by ASIC in the same way that the NFA and CFTC in North America censure firms, that being with a wind-up order and restitution to clients.
It was always such a good combination; leverage at 1:500 which is how the investors (not traders, investors), in China like it, in a very well organized package that comes with proper leadership, first class business and technological infrastructure and astute regulation.
ASIC had no reason to go down the route it has taken, and it certainly appears to the analytical eye that ASIC officials realize that too, especially considering the backtracking which took place recently when the regulator issued letters to all companies under its auspices to desist from onboarding clients from outside Australia, and subsequently stated that this matter may be revisited.
The new proposals, however, are somewhat concrete and are very stringent. Where they differ from European regulations is that whilst leverage restrictions on CFDs are central to ASIC’s remit which does indeed emulate that of Europe, cross-border sale of instruments is likely to be banned for good, decimating the well developed Chinese and South East Asian IB networks that many Australian brokers have made their core business and done extremely well from.
Last year, whilst large publicly listed retail brokerages in the Northern Hemisphere such as IG Group and Plus500 showed signs of extreme difficulties in making headway financially, Australian firms such as Pepperstone and IC Markets literally romped home with gigantic profits, largely due to their ability to provide the absolutely desirable package to massive Chinese and South East Asian partner networks.
The cross-border curtailing has put an end to this, and to that effect, has resulted in some Australian firms heading to offshore islands such as the Seychelles (!!!) instead of restructuring their business by using the massive revenues gained from China to be able to abide by the regulations and appeal to Western and domestic market customers. With revenues such as $500 million per month in some cases, there is no reason why some of that cannot be reinvested to make the company a rival to Hargreaves Lansdown.
What it says
The proposal is lengthy and detailed. Leverage is on the top of the agenda, however before everyone runs for the hills let’s take stock of previous events here. In 2011 when the Japanese FSA reduced leverage on OTC derivatives in Japan, the world’s most populous market with FX traders – Japan’s retail FX sector represents 35% of all international retail FX order flow, all processed by Japanese companies – everyone in the world thought Japanese traders would seek offshore, restriction-free companies and that massive giants doing over 1 trillion dollars a month in notional volume would cease to operate.
This did not happen, and indeed the contrary did. Japanese traders actually traded even more, and deposited more margin capital into the brokers, strengthening the assets under management of Japanese brokers and stopping any large numbers of client accounts being zeroed due to risk created by high leverage in a volatile market.
With that in mind, the Australian halo effect has been earned via very hard work on the part of Australian brokerages, therefore it is unlikely that customers would eschew that and go to an offshore firm, especially as many people in that region know full well what offshore firms with no regulations are like, as APAC has been a huge target for them over the years, usually with disastrous results.
Indeed, cross border transactions will likely be an issue, but for many high net worth APAC participants, trips to Australia are regular, and many have bank account facilities there, hence it may well draw more business into Australia.
In the usual very methodical style which ASIC has been well known for, the regulator states that CFD issuers usually set a ‘liquidation’ level, which is the level at which an open CFD position is closed by the CFD issuer if the retail client does not have enough money in their CFD trading account to cover adverse movements on their position or to respond to margin
The proposal continues to state that in some circumstances, the retail client’s loss on that position once it is automatically closed out may exceed their investment, which means they owe money to the issuer.
“In our 2019 review we found that during the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018: There were over 9.3 million positions that were automatically closed out by CFD issuers for around 1 million active clients; there were over 41,000 CFD trading accounts that went into negative
balance (i.e. the retail client owed money to the CFD issuer); and the total negative balance (i.e. the total amount owed by those retail
clients) was over $33 million.”
Referring to Britain’s regulator for this particular part of the proposal, ASIC states that “Analysis by the UK FCA showed that for the currency pair USD/GBP, at a leverage ratio of 500:1 and a 50% automatic margin close-out, retail clients who do not make an additional investment over a two-hour span would be automatically closed out and on the losing side of the trade 81% of the time; and either lose all of, or more than, their initial margin 44% of the time.
“CFD issuers may offer retail clients certain types of orders, such as ‘stoploss’ orders or ‘guaranteed stop-loss’ orders, which are promoted as a means of capping potential losses. Generally, these types of orders allow a retail client to pre-set a price to close out their CFD position” says the proposal.
“Clients pay a fee when entering a guaranteed stop-loss order for a CFD position (similar to an option premium for a call or put option). Ordinary ‘stop-loss’ do not remove all the risk of significant losses. The retail client’s position may not be closed out at the nominated price
(e.g. if there is lack of liquidity in the underlying market, or if there are price ‘gaps’)” says the report. In this case, it appears that ASIC considers CFDs to be similar in structure to binary options, which is not a good sign at all.
Risk of losses which are greater than the retail client’s initial investment
In 2015, when the Swiss National Bank removed the peg on the EURCHF pair, causing tremendous market volatility which saw off some brokerages due to exposure to their liquidity provider, and cost others a fortune to the same effect, some retail clients were actually sued by their broker for negative balances. Many were not, however they theoretically would have had to pay the negative balance to the broker if the broker concerned had requested it.
Many brokerages wrote it off on the grounds of goodwill, largely so that they did not create a poor public image in the aftermath of sudden volatility causing unstable markets which could not have been predicted as the Swiss National Bank simply did it without warning.
In terms of margin calls, ASIC’s proposals include the issue of potential exposure to negative balances, among other areas.
“If changes in the market value of the underlying asset have a negative effect on the retail client’s open CFD position, the CFD issuer may require the retail client to deposit additional money into their CFD trading account (i.e. to meet their margin requirement). This is known as a ‘margin call’ and may be made by the CFD issuer at short notice to the retail client” says ASIC.
“Retail clients who fail to ‘top up’ their account within the relatively short timeframe provided may see their position automatically closed out by the CFD issuer. When ‘margin calls’ are triggered in close succession (e.g. if the underlying asset price continues to move against the position like in a ‘flash crash’), the amount of cumulative losses incurred by retail clients can significantly exceed the amount they initially intended to commit to the CFD position” says ASIC’s proposal.
“An example of this would be that a client receives a call from the CFD issuer to say that his CFD account balance is too low (being less than 50% of the initial margin) and he will need to top up his CFD account with additional funds. The client is reluctant to realise his losses and still believes in his forecast of the market. He deposits another $5,000 into the account, which means his
balance is now $9,716” says ASIC.
ASIC then states that liquidity (i.e. the volume of orders and trades) in the market for a CFD’s underlying asset can affect a retail client’s ability to trade CFDs over that asset. There is a risk that the CFD issuer may decline a retail client’s order oronly agree to execute the order at an inferior price.
ASIC’s concerns over lack of liquidity that can occur at the time of opening or closing a CFD position are also included. For example, a retail client could be left with an open CFD position which they are unable to close. This increases the likelihood of potential losses and may cause clients to have negative equity—meaning that they unexpectedly owe money to the CFD issuer. Additionally, ASIC has concerns about slippage and beleives that its curtailment of leverage will assist brokers in executing orders with less risk of slippage.
The ASIC proposals cover what ASIC demonstrates to be a rise in complaints about the practices of CFD issuers in Australia by retail clients, up from around 500 in 2015 to over 3000 in the first half of 2019, and looks at client loss risk.
Perhaps the most alarming prose used in the proposal is ASIC’s statement “Significant detriment to retail clients from CFDs” which then goes on to produce case studies of actual traders.
ASIC states that CFD issuers reported in the ASIC 2017 review that 63% of clients lost money trading margin FX; and 72% of clients lost money trading other CFDs.
“As outlined in paragraph 70, retail client losses from trading CFDs are a component of the $1.5 billion gross trading revenue CFD issuers received in 2018. Our evidence of client losses is broadly consistent with reported losses in other jurisdictions. For example, the FCA reported that an estimated 78% of active retail client CFD accounts were loss-making, with total loss estimated at £1.07 billion a year. The FCA noted that other regulators in Europe reported similar poor results for retail clients” says ASIC.
The report looks at account loss percentages in European jurisdictions as a reference point, showing figures of between 75% and 80% of all traders losing money on CFD trading.
Similarly, leverage of between 1:200 and 1:500 has been pilloried by the ASIC proposals, and this is likely to be one of the first things addressed should the proposals be implemented as actual law.
How OTC products are marketed is also a major part of the proposals. ASIC is concerned about the increase in marketing spend from $91 million to $131 million among retail margin brokers over a 2 year period and that clients do not seek financial advice before trading OTC derivatives with retail brokers.
“We have observed the aggressive marketing practices used by CFD issuers over many years. They are used to attract new clients as well as to entice existing clients to trade more. We have received reports from industry stakeholders that there is a significant turnover or ‘churn’ of retail clients, and some issuers are heavily reliant on aggressive marketing techniques to attract new retail clients” says ASIC.
We know ASIC is serious on this matter, as the regulator has closed down companies in the past for aggressive marketing practices.
Ultimately, ASIC has made a very detailed point here, however it may well be a stabilizing set of rules.
Australia, after all, is home to a very well capitalized and astute FX industry and is more able to adapt and perform well than many of its counterparts in Europe which did not have the same level of business acumen when ESMA unleashed the MiFID II rulings two years ago.
Additionally, support and governance from the Australian authorities will likely be handled very professionally, a contrast to the bungling by CySec two years ago.

Ethereum sta facendo fatica a risollevarsi dal livello di $ 170 contro il dollaro USA. L’ETH è infatti sceso di recente sotto i $ 170 e si è indebolito di oltre il 7%. Il recente calo è stato tale che il prezzo ha addirittura rotto l’area di supporto di $ 160. Inoltre, c’è stata una chiusura inferiore a $ 165 e della media mobile semplice ogni 100 ore.
Infine, il prezzo viene scambiato vicino alla principale area di supporto $ 150 e un minimo si è formato vicino a $ 153. Ancora più importante, il prezzo del bitcoin è sceso di oltre l’8% e ha rotto molti importanti supporti come $ 7.800 e $ 7.500.
Guardando Ethereum, il prezzo è attualmente in fase di recupero e scambiato al di sopra del livello di $ 155. C’è stata una rottura al di sopra del livello di ritracciamento del 23,6% Fib del recente declino dal massimo di $ 178 a $ 153. Tuttavia, il prezzo sta affrontando molti ostacoli al rialzo vicino ai livelli di $ 162 e $ 165. Inoltre, la linea di tendenza ribassista evidenziata mercoledì 23 ottobre è intatta con resistenza vicino a $ 165 sul grafico orario di ETH / USD.
Il livello di ritracciamento del 50% Fib del recente declino dal massimo di $ 178 a $ 153 è anche vicino al livello di $ 165 per agire come un forte resistenza. Pertanto, Ethereum potrebbe affrontare una forte resistenza se correggesse verso l’area di $ 165. Sul lato negativo, i livelli di $ 155 e $ 150 sono importanti supporti.
Non sarà facile per gli orsi eliminare la barriera di $ 150. Quindi, ci sono possibilità di un rimbalzo decente a breve termine al di sopra della resistenza di $ 162.
Osservando il grafico, il prezzo di Ethereum si è chiaramente ritirato dai livelli di supporto di $ 152 e $ 150. Sta mostrando alcuni segni positivi sopra $ 155 e $ 160. Detto questo, il prezzo deve riprendersi al di sopra dei livelli di resistenza di $ 162 e $ 165 per iniziare una discreta mossa verso l’alto. Le prossime resistenze chiave sono vicine ai livelli $ 170 e $ 172.

La app aerospaziale Trusat utilizzerà blockchain Ethereum
La società di tecnologia software Blockchain ConsenSys ha svelato Trusat, un’applicazione di localizzazione satellitare basata sulla rete Ethereum (ETH). Secondo il tweet dell’azienda pubblicato il 22 ottobre, Trusat mira ad affrontare il problema dei detriti spaziali che potrebbero danneggiare l’infrastruttura spaziale terrestre.
L’iniziativa spera che gli utenti della sua app seguano i satelliti nel cielo notturno e registrino le loro posizioni per contribuire a creare un record. L’applicazione indica anche quando e dove cercare i segni di massima priorità.
La compagnia ha spiegato: “Il numero di satelliti sta aumentando di 25x. Le collisioni minacciano la tecnologia da cui dipendiamo ogni giorno e il nostro futuro spaziale. […] TruSat è progettato per essere un sistema basato sui cittadini per la creazione di un registro di orbite satellitari affidabile a livello globale – una risorsa disponibile gratuitamente che può essere utilizzata per valutare le operazioni orbitali alla luce degli standard di sostenibilità spaziale.”
In base al notiziario sulla tecnologia GeekWire, il co-fondatore di ConsenSys Space Chris Lewicki ha sottolineato il ruolo della blockchain di Ethereum nel preservare l’integrità dei dati, affermando: “Progettare un sistema che sia allo stesso tempo aperto, autonomo e resistente a input dannosi ed errati presenta una notevole sfida ingegneristica. […] Una grande parte di ciò che rende possibile tutto questo è la tecnologia blockchain di Ethereum, integrata in tutta la nostra tabella di marcia.”
Come riportato da Cointelegraph il 31 ottobre 2018, la prima iniziativa di ConsenSys Space è stata l’acquisizione della società scova-asteroidi Planetary Resources. La società ha spiegato il suo scopo in quel momento: “Immaginiamo un programma spaziale in cui qualsiasi persona può partecipare e contribuire. Quindi stiamo costruendo piattaforme di collaborazione per diversificare, democratizzare e decentralizzare le attività spaziali.”
Comunque, questo non è il primo progetto basato su blockchain che coinvolge lo spazio. Il 18 dicembre 2018, Blockstream aveva già ampliato il suo servizio satellitare, trasmettendo la blockchain di Bitcoin a tutte le principali masse terrestri della Terra.
Sta arrivando Fuel, per velocizzare la scalabilità di Ethereum
La società Fuel Labs – un’organizzazione senza scopo di lucro creata da un piccolo gruppo di programmatori Ethereum – ha svelato Fuel, una soluzione per una più veloce scalabilità dei blocchi alternativa per Ethereum.
Il progetto dovrebbe essere pubblicato presto su mainnet, a seguito di controlli di sicurezza per assicurarsi che sia sicuro. Negli ultimi due mesi ha lavorato tranquillamente su Fuel, che si basa in gran parte su un documento di ricerca del ricercatore della succitata ConsenSys, John Adler (ConsenSys finanzia un Decrypt editorialmente indipendente).
Il post del blog afferma: “Dopo alcune conversazioni approfondite, abbiamo iniziato a lavorare sodo per mettere insieme un’implementazione realistica del ridimensionamento di Ethereum in grado di risolvere un singolo problema: pagamenti stablecoin sostenibili, scalabili, economici e affidabili su Ethereum: Fuel appunto.”
Le stime prudenti del team affermano che Fuel potrebbe rendere la transazione Ethereum cinque volte più economica. Inoltre, stima che potrebbe aumentare il numero di transazioni che Ethereum può gestire al secondo da circa 10 a 50. Guardando al futuro, vede quel numero salire a 2000 transazioni al secondo (TPS), o addirittura fino a un milione.
Ethereum è una piattaforma per gestire molti pagamenti in criptovaluta, tra cui migliaia di token e app decentralizzate (dapps) costruite su di esso. Ma attualmente sta lottando per gestire l’enorme quantità di transazioni. Finora ci sono state molte soluzioni proposte, come la rete off-chain Plasma, ma nessuna si è ancora dimostrata veramente efficace.
Fuel Labs sta pianificando di utilizzare una nuova tecnologia chiamata “rollup ottimistici” – di cui il co-fondatore di Ethereum Vitalik Buterin ha discusso di recente – per costruire una soluzione che, sostiene, aiuterà meglio Ethereum a scalare immediatamente, portando a transazioni molto più economiche.
I rollup ottimistici si basano sul concetto di sidechain, in cui il lavoro viene scaricato su una blockchain parallela. Ma questi non risolvono completamente il problema, dal momento che comportano ancora molte transazioni sulla principale blockchain di Ethereum.
Invece, i rollup ottimistici effettuano pochissime transazioni sulla blockchain principale essenzialmente raggruppando le transazioni insieme. In questo caso, i dati sono ancora disponibili sulla blockchain principale di Ethereum ma sono nascosti in profondità nelle strutture di dati note come alberi merkle.
Tuttavia, è possibile trovare i dati, purché tu sappia dove cercare, il che significa che puoi ancora dimostrare che le transazioni di rollup ottimistiche sono accurate perché puoi cercare una qualsiasi delle transazioni sulla blockchain di Ethereum principale, togliendo il peso dalle spalle di Ethereum pur facendo uso del suo alto livello di sicurezza.

A Columbus Fire Deputy Chief is being investigated by the department for discrepancies on his timesheet.
The allegations against Deputy Chief Jack Reall came to light in “The Worm” an underground, anonymous newsletter circulated among Columbus Firefighters.
“The Worm” states “Deputy Chief goes on company business vacation and is stupid enough to post pictures of his adventures on social media…”
Reall, a 30-year veteran of Columbus Fire who was promoted to Deputy Chief in 2015, received a memorandum on February 1st of this year informing him of an investigation into his time and attendance.
Prompted by the letter from “The Worm” the memo alleges impropriety in what’s actually referred to as “Company Business Vacancy” of CBV, an open shift created by an administrative assignment typically giving whoever’s filling in a higher rate.
The division of fire is investigating what the letter refers to as a “significant amount of CBV hours” as well as “Kelly Days” or certain regular days off, that Reall listed on his time card.
The department’s also looking into Reall’s use and approval of Special Duty, deployment or training with Ohio Task Force One and FEMA as well as time he put down as being at the National Fire Academy and the NFPA.
The memo also states that investigators want to know why Reall claimed to have been activated or deployed by another agency but allegedly used vacation, why some timesheet entries were changed “a significant amount of time” and why Reall was paid, in some instances, by the city and another agency “redundantly and concurrently”.
NBC4 reached out to Reall, the Firefighter’s union, the Fire Department spokesperson and the city of Columbus for comment but nobody would talk pending the outcome. Reall’s met with the division of fire twice so far to answer to the allegations, on February 19th and 25th. It could take at least 6-months until there’s a resolution.

After details of Formula 1's new 2021 rules were revealed, we explain why Liberty and the FIA have this time given themselves the best chance of improving the racing
Aero forces on the proposed 2021 F1 car, with red showing areas of higher pressure Image: FIA
Over the British Grand Prix weekend, Liberty Media and the FIA released more details of the 2021 Formula 1 regulations, which are due to finally be signed off in October. It would be fair to say that, if fully realised, they represent the most radical overhaul the sport has ever seen, fundamentally changing the way the cars generate downforce and how the flow of air over their bodywork is managed, in the hope of improving the racing.
Whether these alterations, coupled with cost caps, spec parts and other proposed changes, will truly equalise the field remains to be seen, but what is certain is that Liberty and the FIA cannot be accused of not doing their homework, for which they should be commended.
The key is to make sure someone can’t find a way to break the regulations and get a huge advantage
A high-calibre, in-house team – including Pat Symonds, formerly of Benetton, Renault and Williams, Nicholas Tombazis, formerly of Ferrari – has been assembled to make sure the new regulations are not just a stab in the dark, and the teams enlisted to make use of their engineering firepower.
Of course, teams being teams, they all have their own agenda in such matters, but the way the rule-making process has been managed, to a great extent, should have negated this.
Concept work
The initial concept for the car shown here was Formula 1’s own work. It is the fruition of an extensive aerodynamic research program, the first step of which was simply to understand why it is so hard for one car to follow another. This is a very important point, as without knowing the reason behind the problem, it would be impossible to construct a ruleset to fix it.
To do this, Liberty went out and bought its own F1 car, in the form of the 2017 wind tunnel model and CAD data from the Manor Formula 1 team, following that team’s demise.
This model gave Liberty’s team the perfect basis to run its own CFD [computational fluid dynamics] simulations of the wake generated by a car. It compared the results of these simulations with those gathered in a wind tunnel (Sauber’s) to make sure its results were as true to life as possible. One example of the CFD wake simulations is illustrated.
An illustration of a modern F1 car's CFD wake Image: FIA
Once the group was happy with the validity of the wake model, it was then able to study how the wake interacted with a car following behind, working out how much downforce the following car would lose in various positions and, importantly, why that downforce was being lost. As this process was underway, work also began on an aerodynamic design concept to minimise these effects.
Tyre wake
One of the major issues, which was already known but better understood as a result of the research, was the disruption to a following car’s aero performance caused by the air forced out to the side of the car in front.
A modern F1 car is phenomenally complicated from an aerodynamic perspective, but the bulk of downforce is generated by a few key mechanisms: the front and rear wings, the front edge of the floor and the diffuser. In essence, aerodynamicists are trying to manage the airflow over the cars in such a way that air reaches these parts in as controlled a manner as possible.
More: Five classic Formula 1 ground effect cars
One of the biggest challenges for an F1 aerodynamicist is managing the messy flow that comes off the cars’ open wheels, both from the top of the wheel and its underside where it meets the track. The aim being to stop this ‘wake’ from the wheels disrupting the carefully constructed flows around the centre of the car.
You may have heard the term Y250 vortex bandied around in this context. All this is (in very simple terms) is the airflow running down the centre of the car, which is greatly influenced by the vortices that spin off the stacked wing elements, which end abruptly at the point they meet the spec central section of the front wing, extending 250mm either side of the car’s centreline (hence the Y250 vortex, Y being the axis down the centre of the car).
All of the protrusions, winglets and other carbon flicks that festoon the nose and area along the front sides of a car are designed to fine-tune this flow, maximising its usefulness when it gets to the powerful front floor section and retain its energy as it heads towards the back of the car. Having the wakes from the wheels barging in on this flow would ruin all of this work, hence why teams do everything they can to push these far out to the sides of the car.
Liberty and FIA have released more details on F1's proposed 2021 regulations Image: Motorsport Images
The problem being, this makes life difficult for a following car as it ploughs through this mass of jumbled air swirling around at track level.
Liberty’s concept, the first iteration of which was codenamed Hotel, looked to stop the wheel wakes being pushed outboard and at the same time, reduce the detrimental impact of running in ‘dirty’ air.
Instead of placing emphasis on the previously mentioned tools for creating downforce, greater use would be made of the underfloor, with the current flat floor-diffuser set-up replaced with a tunnel system, creating a ground effect set-up where the underside of the car becomes one big venturi.
Generally speaking, and as shown by IndyCar, such an approach is less prone to being upset by the effects of following another car. Of even greater importance is the work Liberty has done to lock down the way airflow off the front wheels is managed.
The airflow paths on a 2021 concept F1 car Image: FIA
Looking at the front of a 2019 car, much of the ‘furniture’ towards the outside end of the wing, as well as the brake duct design, is responsible for pushing the wakes outboard, even after changes to the rules for this year reduced freedom in this area (which stemmed from the early 2021 work). The 2021 proposals remove the means to push the air outboard and the wheel wake is instead sucked back inboard.
With the current cars, this approach would greatly reduce downforce, but with a shift of emphasis to underfloor aero, the impact will be lessened. It also means that the wheel wakes will be drawn along the car, then ejected high up behind the car in the ‘mushroom’ of airflow created by the underfloor and rear wing, pushing it above any following car. The new car design also features a reworked rear aero layout to push this mushroom higher than it currently reaches.
The process by which Liberty refined this concept is also laudable. Once the initial Hotel model was completed, Liberty and the FIA enlisted the assistance of the teams to run detailed CFD studies on the model as both a leading and a following car. The teams were given permission to complete CFD work outside of the current restrictions that the rules enforce, provided strict guidelines were adhered to.
The proposed 2021 F1 car from the front Image: Pan_Nullo​
The data the teams gathered was then fed back to Liberty’s team to help refine its model and to allow back-to-back comparison between the wake effects of a 2018 car and the Hotel model. Following this round of work, completed in early 2019, a new model codenamed India, incorporating some modifications, was devised. This is the basis for the illustrations shown here.
The results were certainly encouraging, with the following car only losing about 10 per cent of its downforce when 10 metres behind another car. The current cars lose around 45 per cent.
There then followed two other development periods where the teams looked at specific areas of the model at the bequest of Liberty and the FIA, which concluded at the end of May. The teams also provided input on practical elements of the new design. It is all well and good having a shiny CFD model, but it is no good if it doesn’t provide sufficient cooling provision, for example.
Development of the rules package is ongoing, with Liberty now focusing on trying to ‘break it’ from the perspective of a team, as will be the case when they go live. They want to minimise the chances of the good work undertaken so far being undone by a team finding a development route that goes counter to their aims.
More: Ground effect to make a comeback in 2021 F1 rules proposals
Speaking to the teams at Silverstone, it appeared that the main concepts of the regulation proposals were agreed upon and that the reasons for the delay until October were wrangling over the fine detail and ensuring what appeared was a workable set of rules, rather than a mere concept idea.
One technical director commented, “I think that by moving the date to the end of October, it gives the time to check whether the regulations are robust enough… the key is to make sure someone can’t find a way to break them and get a huge advantage over everybody else.”
We’ll have to wait until 2021 to get a true impression of what the new cars will look like, but it is safe to say, the final form of the rules on which they are based will be a result of thorough research, rather than just informed guesswork as has often been the case in the past.

Melbourne-based retail FX and CFD industry expert and researcher Justin Grossbard looks at the potential effects of ASIC’s proposed leverage restriction and how Australian brokers can really stand strong and consider their high quality service to be a loyalty factor for their clients
By Justin Grossbard, co-owner of compareforexbrokers.com.au based in Melbourne, Australia
The retail FX brokerage sector in Australia is without doubt one of the success stories of online retail financial services.
For almost two decades, Australia has been steadily and pragmatically building its reputation and global standing as a benchmark for retail FX and CFD trading.
A first class business culture, thriving national economy, increasingly prudent and well structured regulations for electronic trading firms, and perhaps most importantly, close trade ties with the FX industry’s golden egg: China and the Asia Pacific region.
Recently, the Australian regulator of non bank financial services, ASIC, took the draconian step of issuing proposals that seek to restrict the method by which OTC derivatives companies can offer certain leveraged trading products from their operations in Australia which fall under the rules of the Australian Financial Services License (AFSL).
The most concerning aspects of the proposals to industry participants are the potential restriction on leverage of FX and CFD products, and the other being the restriction of the sale or provision of any OTC derivative product to overseas customers by Australian electronic trading companies.
Whilst this appeared to happen quickly, there has been speculation for some years that ASIC may take steps to follow the European rulings, and perhaps more specifically, Japan’s restrictions on leverage over 7 years ago.
Let’s take a step back, and examine how Japan, an equally conservative, domestic-focused market made up of dedicated and analytical traders responded when the national regulator restricted leverage. It created a more sustainable and certain environment which was embraced and welcomed, volumes went up and foreign firms still could not gain traction.
Contrary to the opinion of many brokers in Western jurisdictions at the time who had anticipated an influx of Japanese clients wanting to eschew the Japanese giants and break out of the highly domestic market-focused approach by Japanese clients who are absolutely loyal to Japanese FX firms in order to benefit from the leverage in Europe, Australia and Britain which was far higher than the 1:25 imposed by Japan at the time, the reality was that absolutely nothing happened.
No Japanese traders switched from the vast giants of Tokyo. In light of current nervousness surrounding the future of the Western retail FX markets in the immediate period following ESMA’s leverage restrictions that were recently set in force, and now Australia’s proposals, a feeling of uncertainty has permeated across small to medium sized brokerages, many technology providers whose solutions are provided to them on a volume capitalization basis, and even among major mainstream research and news entities on the basis of concern over potential market contraction and shrinking revenues due to less leverage, and advertising bans by Google and Facebook relating to certain product ranges.
Despite lack of international competition in Japan, business is booming for domestic retail FX firms, and no evidence of Japanese traders looking to trade with overseas firm has come about. Rather topically at the moment, it is worth looking back to early 2013 when the Japanese FSA implemented leverage restrictions on all Japanese market participants, spurring speculation that the Japanese traders doing such massive volume would seek overseas firms and that the rulings would damage the vast domination of domestic firms – but no such shift occurred and it was business as usual. This can be used as a yardstick to gauge current ESMA rulings.
Between January and March 2016, 15,413,316 trillion yen was traded on an OTC basis among Japan’s companies, a 50.2% increase over the previous quarter and a record until that point.
Therefore it is appropriate to consider that Japan is not a market to approach externally or internally by non-Japanese companies. Japan’s FX industry is completely centered on the domestic market, yet it accounts for between 35% and 40% of all retail FX volume in the entire world.
Immediately after the Japanese FSA implemented the leverage restrictions and took the view that 1:30 should be the maximum ratio, overseas companies made substantial attempts to bring some of the vast business from Japan’s retail market onboard, with very little ability to gain traction.
Quite the opposite occurred. Japan’s traders actually knuckled down and traded even more volume, placing an emphasis on raising the amount of margin that they trade with, instead of having a minimal margin and relying on leverage.
So strong is Japan’s domestic market that its own companies have pulled out of other markets. MONEX Group sold its US and Australian client bases of its subsidiary IBFX three years ago, and discontinued the use of the MetaTrader 4 platform completely on all markets, focusing on its proprietary Tradestation.
Therefore, if this can be taken as a yardstick, leverage restrictions should be not the gravest concern. Australia can consider itself as desireable to retail traders in Australia itself and the wider APAC region which looks up to Australian firms and holds them to a very high standard.
Actually, there is a very interesting equation in play here in that each Australian broker’s management must now stress test their operations for the benchmark risk factors and the impact on their balance sheet of three factors, those being 40% reduction in 80% of their clients losses while the 20% winners earnings remain the same, 25% reduction in turnover across the board and a 25% reduction in earnings.”
A risk consultant that we know well in Australia told us recently “Now this is based on 50:1 leverage and at 20:1, I am not sure there would be a linear relationship in financial impact. Of course, most run a one dimensional B Book to go a hybrid STP in B Book and use A Book risk management, either full no A book hedging or all A book, and for most this is out of the question as there is no resources, no cash, no capital.”
Therefore, maybe its time for full STP to make a come back, that way of course, they cannot offer turnover rebates to retail traders or IBs and then, of the 65 brokers, if it follows the path as per the restrictions that the US brokers experienced under the Dodd-Frank Act which prevented them from operating with overseas clients, having to stump up huge capital reserves for regulatory escrow, then which 8 – 10 brokers will remain?
There has been a recent dialog between consultants and academics that focus on how the regulatory reforms in the US have panned out and what may happen if other advanced regulators such as ASIC follow them.
A general consensus is that this was a win/win situation for many retail customers especially if they were novice traders, but the loser in that case was the FX margin brokers. Of course, Australia has around 65 FX margin brokers and leverage may well go down to somewhere between 20:1 – 30:1, so maybe the landscape for broker here will be affected but the large firms will simply follow the path of the ones that stayed in America such as your reference last week to Interactive Brokers, or will attract a different client who will put more margin capital in and carry on trading with less risk, as happened in Japan.
Indeed it did, FinanceFeeds has many times made the point that Japanese brokers reduced margin in 2011 and despite the speculation that overseas and offshore firms would suddenly receive a deluge of Japanese traders – something they all wanted because of the massive volumes traded on retail brokerages in Japan – however this did not happen and Japan’s big three, GMO Click, DMM Securities and MONEX carried on from strength to strength often trading over $1 trillion per month in notional volume post leverage restriction.
This may happen in Australia, as clients of Australian brokers in the APAC region fully appreciate the quality of the firms, their leadership and the regulatory and business structure in Australia which is among the best in the world.
Perhaps this is a time for brokers to focus on the quality of their brand and engendering client loyalty as the regulatory reforms take place.

Willem Toet explains…CFD Post Processing. Part 3
Welcome to last of the three-part series by former Head of Aerodynamics at Benetton, Ferrari and Sauber F1, Professor Willem Toet, who exclusively explains CFD Post Processing in depth. Part 1 here Part 2 here
Record Your Work We’ve all done it. Short cut the paperwork to do some new analysis and make a decision. Then a week later with another few hundred cases down the line you’ve forgotten why you made a particular decision. Write logical reports – it will help you in the future and help you to hand over a project or project intellectual property. To go back and fill in the blanks later is far less efficient. During the process of writing your report you will be “forced” to think again about your decisions – to justify them if you like. For CFD cases related to cars, here is a starting suggestion. For each and every geometry you test – write a few lines and explain what you’ve done and what you’ve learned. Even mistakes and unexpected results teach you something. Below I give an overview image of what a single run might look like in a report.
90. This shows an arrangement of information that I feel is reasonable – but of course you can’t see much detail this way. The report should include the following information: –

A description of the purpose and expectations of a test (and relevant information about the baseline for the test)

Setup information and forces / relevant values for the baseline and for the test Delta forces / values seen due to the change made (F1 teams add hundreds of incremental gains to make a package – big steps like this one are rare)

Images and words to describe what the test means – e.g. what is the conclusion, where did something change, why – do you understand the mechanism

Next steps if any
92. The idea of this part of the report is to give the reader a clear mental picture of change that has been made. What you show will change significantly depending on what is changed. Here, the title says what has changed. In this case the teardrop-shaped wishbone legs of the front suspension have been rotated to an angle that is more in line with the average airflow (around them). The image of the car has the wishbones coloured in red to indicate that this is the area that has changed. The first cross section includes a small local bulge for the thread of a bolt in joint. The red is intended to be the old design (removed), the green the new (added). In this example, more text could be used to describe the change.
93. Useful setup and run identification information. It will help you a lot if you give your CFD runs unique code numbers. The more the code makes sense to you, the more you can follow what is happening. For example, with the project “WT” means customer Willem Toet, “03” means 3rd project from that customer, R009 means run 9 from this series of tests. If you know you will do thousands of runs, you’ll need a longer run number. Then descriptions. In this case the descriptions for both the baseline and the test item could have been thought about more. For run “WT03 R010” it would have been better to write something like “as R009 with front suspension legs rotated to 10 degrees nose down (were at 0 degrees)”. This would take more space and risks being partly hidden by the next cell, but would convey more information that is likely to become important. Making the comments make sense is a critical skill to learn – you need to communicate to the next person and it does not matter if you remember / understand – if they don’t then you have not communicated well enough. I have found myself gently trying to “educate” some very experienced people – so please step back and think. Then the CFD setup information that can be changed during runs in the sequence such as ride height and other attitude parameters, car “speed” etc. Think about what might be changed when you set up the template (I used Excel here).
95. An assembly (in the picture) of the remainder of the numerical information. Your project may well need something different but consider having overall values (resolved at the contact patches for a car, train, motorbike etc.) of drag, side and downforce. Be aware of the frame of reference for these. This is argued about even in F1. I resolve in car fore/aft direction about the contact patches, some people resolve around wind direction. Either can work – the forces acting on the vehicle/body are the same in the end – the rest is just a bit of maths. You will notice that we don’t use a huge number of decimal places (significant digits). Not much point displaying to great accuracy when the convergence and repeatability suggest that won’t be real. Shown also are front and rear downforce, “coefficients” of drag and downforce, front and rear downforce, efficiency and balance. When I say “coefficients” it is common and easy to use the coefficient multiplied by area. Saves bothering to calculate the area – which will change with virtually every run you do. In many research fields a nominal area is used and that number is not changed. Cd.A is a nicer way to express the coefficients. Then the main force directions (drag and downforce) are broken down into various areas of the car and radiator flow is also calculated. This early iteration of the design had negative flow backwards. We gave a young engineer some space and he learned a lot. Just imagine if we had not bothered to measure this in the CFD case! I’ve been there – a boss bought a Le Mans car from a factory team and the cooling didn’t work! Was easy to “fix” though. Needed some help from an aero expert.

As well as the breakdown for each configuration a difference line is calculated. Note that colours are used to show if something is better or worse. This result is a rare clear one. Same drag, more front and more rear downforce. Front suspension lift is reduced, front wing and floor downforce improved. Perfect! Don’t expect this all the time!!
96. Near the numerical data. I like to show a few images that demonstrate something useful about the case or the change that has been made. This might be a delta plot, a convergence history, a cross section. Whatever you show should be relevant for the report or should add some value. Here I show drag accumulation and lift distribution (in the standard X direction) as two of the plots. I find other plots of a similar ilk but sideways to be useful too. Now, I have given a lot away – here I hold a bit back. If you’re bright and have done some serious analysis of your own first – then perhaps we can have a chat about why that might be important for a vehicle. Here is another key skill to learn – find the best concise way to communicate the most important aspects of the result – explain the mechanisms at play. Thanks again to TotalSim. Repeatability and Incremental Gains Think a bit also about the repeatability of your results. There are many ways of doing this. One is a very fine ride height or yaw angle sweep with complete remeshing between steps. You will get a performance curve that isn’t smooth. Deviation from the curve is your best-case repeatability. Smaller steps than that may be a step in the opposite direction to the direction you think but suffer from errors caused by your method. A mesh sensitivity study is also a must if you are to convince other people that you have understood the strengths and limitations of your method. In F1 we have not reached full mesh independence even at a billion really high quality, intelligently created cells. None the less understanding the interaction is an essential step in your understanding.
​ Another word of caution… CFD has been brilliant for teaching a deeper understanding of airflow and the mechanisms at play, particularly with complex flow schemes. That’s its strength. Most CFD done when one is learning is “approximate” at best. So, think about the limitations not only of the method but also of the particular attitudes you’ve picked to do your analysis. Below is an example of why you need to stay mentally awake.
98. This example is the delta effect of adding a diffuser fence at two different vehicle attitudes (heights). At one attitude downforce (at the rear) is lost. At the other downforce is increased. Often students (e.g. in Formula Student) argue that they are sure they have found performance using single attitude research. Best to maintain a hint of humility. We’ve all been humbled by facts we’d forgotten to consider, and some of us have been playing at this game for a long while (that means we’ve made more mistakes than you). One learns from these mistakes. Aero forces on cars change and can change a lot. Think about your worst-case scenario. What happens when the car is accelerating (high front, lowish rear), when the front is “on the ground” in braking, when the driver gets carried away and has the rear sliding wildly sideways. These are real situations. If you are doing Formula Student / SAE, look at the real attitudes of the car from last year, think about wind speed vs. car speed and imagine a worst case of wind and yaw in “skid pan”. Map your baseline and occasional intermediate steps in those attitudes. Work with the vehicle dynamics team and calculate the overall “balance” of the car when you combine mechanical and aero forces. When you think about correlation – and I sincerely hope you do, then consider carefully what you can and what you cannot measure in the wind tunnel or on the roads / tracks with your vehicle or object. If you compare to a race car, with forces measured using push rods (or pull rods, damper load cells etc), remember that, a car on track generally does not tell you about wheel or outboard suspension vertical loads. They act directly through the tyres and are not “seen” by the force measurement systsm. CFD though, can measure, and isolate these forces. So you can, both, get a more complete answer and have information to correlate to what is measured by the race car. CFD and your Aero project If you can afford to, take the first steps into this fascinating field of engineering, then please have a go. Get as much information as you can and remember to push the experts to explain as much as possible so you learn as much as you can for yourself. With time and experience, you will be able to take some real understanding from our delicious ‘black art’. Actually, we’ve been fooling the world for a long time, as it is just another branch of engineering that is mostly understandable. You just have to be aware that there are many steps and that flow can be complex. Most of this article has focused on post-processing and the images have come almost exclusively from RANS calculations. A conscious choice. Not everyone has the resources to do unsteady calculations. Some comments from Torbjörn Larsson: “Here we are only considering steady state RANS I guess. I dońt know how deep you want to go here (it can easily become a can of worms), but perhaps you could elaborate a bit on the pros and cons with RANS vs time-resolved CFD. When it comes to making decisions based on RANS results it is important to understand some of its limitations and underlying assumptions. For example; while we are looking at integrated forces acting on surfaces we don’t have any true information on the actual amplitudes/variations. The max instantaneous force may be significantly higher (particularly when we have shedding wakes). “Predicted off surface structures (e.g. vortices) positions are an average and we do not really know much of the spatial envelope. Or, even worse, some structures may just be an artefact of the RANS averaging and don ́t even exist in real life. “This may be a bit over the top, but I’ve spent plenty of time analysing wings over the years trying to optimise the performance (efficiency or downforce) and the fact that most RANS methods cannot, with confidence, predict (and account for) boundary layer turbulence transition is a limitation. I think one needs a lot of experience to get this right while approaching CzMax conditions. “Regarding standard plots. One thing I always try to do is to include some basic plots/images that quickly would reveal if e.g. some boundary conditions have not been set properly or not behaving as expected (e.g. wheel rotations, ground plane, far field conditions, pressure drop over heat exchangers, porous zones, mrfs). And on that topic, always check for overall mass conservation in the computational domain.” I have not been able to be comprehensive with this article. However, if experts out there have suggestions about things that I should include here, I would be interested to discuss them. No doubt the article will evolve as a result. To be honest, it may have been better to start with a starter article – where to begin with CFD, but too late now and I’ll tackle that one another day. Have fun learning!! Further food for thought
 Isolate each geometrical change – combinations often don’t add up so work out what works with what
Learn to distinguish between cause and effect
Think critically – question your results – if something is too good to be true it probably is just that – be sceptical and check
Flow instabilities and “flip flops” in the flow – don’t allow them – they will cause you problems – understand where they come from and eliminate them
Data mining may play a part in the next step of CFD (multi case) analysis – e.g. find all the modifications that increase total pressure in a certain region (a region you’re interested in
exploiting in the near future for example) – see example below
99a. When you are chasing maximum downforce, it is really upsetting (as the boss of an aero group) to see air passing straight through your beloved car doing (nearly) nothing. This thought led to flow lines being traced forward from the area of high energy air behind the car. This is already an evolution. Several people then started working on a device that would deflect air so that we could use it to generate downforce.

ESMA’s opinion is published shortly after it became clear that CySEC is abandoning the risk-based approach to CFD leverage caps.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has published an opinion on product intervention measures taken by Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). The opinion is published shortly after it became clear that the Cypriot regulator is abandoning its risk-based approach to CFD leverage caps, thus leaving its restrictions for offering CFDs to retail clients broadly the same as those once introduced by ESMA.
Hence, there is nothing astonishing in the fact that ESMA’s opinion issued today is supportive of CySEC’s actions. ESMA’s opinion concludes that the proposed measures are justified and proportionate.
Let’s recall that, CySEC had proposed to introduce stricter leverage limits for those retail clients falling within the grey area of the target market and slightly higher leverage limits for the retail clients falling within the upper tier of positive target market. Put simply, various leverage caps would have been applied to various categories of retail clients. But CySEC has abandoned this plan.
Last week, however, CySEC said it received feedback from 15 respondents comprised of Investment Firms, one Industry Association, one National Competent Authority (“NCA”) of another Member State and one retail investor. The retail investor requested CySEC to reconsider its approach and to refrain from introducing any measures particularly in relation to leverage. The NCA raised concerns in relation to the proposed divergence from ESMA measures under CP-02-2019, particularly in relation to whether such divergence will create confusion amongst residents of the specific Member State as to the content of restrictions that are applicable to them.
In relation to the position of the NCA, CySEC said it shared the concerns in relation to the cross-border application of measures and the confusion that might be created by the adoption of different measures across the European Union by the NCAs. To this end, CySEC said it believes that the most appropriate way forward is to structure its measures in a way that incorporates the content of the measures taken by other NCAs when firms falling under its remit market, distribute or sell CFDs in the territory of such Member States.
As a result, the Cyprus National Product Intervention Measures (‘CyNPIMs’) now envisage the adoption of the same leverage limits for all retail clients, with ranges from 2:1 to 30:1 dependent on the type and volatility of the underlying asset:
30:1 for major currency pairs;
20:1 for non-major currency pairs, gold and major indices;
10:1 for commodities other than gold and non-major equity indices;
5:1 for individual equities and other reference values;
2:1 for cryptocurrencies.
ESMA’s opinion also concludes that it is necessary for the national competent authorities of other Member States and the Central Bank of Cyprus to take product intervention measures that are at least as stringent as ESMA’s measures.

innogy SE moved a step closer to the realisation of what is currently its largest development project Sofia , an offshore wind project with a consented installed capacity of up to 1.4 GW. The company secured a contract from the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) the latest contract for Difference (CfD) auction round to support renewable energy projects.

This means that the project can now progress towards the final investment decision and into construction. With a price of £39.65/MWh, this third allocation round has seen the lowest ever price for offshore wind in the UK.

Hans Bünting, COO Renewables of innogy SE, explains: “I am very pleased that Sofia, the largest project in our offshore wind portfolio, has been successful in the latest UK auction. We have passed an important milestone on the way to realising Sofia wind farm and also proved that we can continue to be successful in a very competitive market environment. Sofia’s auction success confirms the excellent work the team has done in recent years. Thanks to our extensive know-how in the development as well as the construction and operation of complex offshore projects and our varied research and development activities we have succeeded in developing a valuable project and in further reducing the costs for offshore wind energy in the UK.”

The consented wind farm, located 195 km off the UK coast on Dogger Bank in the North Sea, is in relatively shallow water depths of 21 to 36 metres. The final investment decision for Sofia is expected to be made during 2020, when contracting agreements with prospective supply chain partners will be completed. The external financing process will then be finalised.

Onshore works are scheduled to begin in 2021, with offshore construction getting underway from 2022. First power is due to be generated in 2024/25 and on the current schedule, the wind farm would be fully operational by the end of 2026.

Once in operation, the total amount of power Sofia could generate would be enough to provide almost 1.2 million average UK homes with their annual electricity needs. The planned investment volume is in the region of £3 billion. Sofia Offshore Wind Farm is 100% owned by innogy SE. innogy will review all options regarding the ownership and financing structure of the project in order to maximise value for the company and shareholders.

innogy is also developing the 857MW Triton Knoll offshore wind farm 32km off the coast of Lincolnshire in the east of England. The wind farm will enter offshore construction in the first half of 2020 with first power anticipated in 2021. Once fully operational, it will be capable of generating renewable energy to power the equivalent of over 800,000 typical UK households.

The Cypriot restrictions for the offering of CFDs to retail investors now envisage the same leverage caps as the ESMA measures.
The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) has today outlined the national measures to restrict the marketing, distribution and sale of contracts for difference (CFDs), with the document revealing that the Cypriot regulator has abandoned the risk-based approach to CFD leverage caps.
Let’s recall that, CySEC proposed to introduce stricter leverage limits for those retail clients falling within the grey area of the target market and slightly higher leverage limits for the retail clients falling within the upper tier of positive target market.

CySEC will proceed with adopting the same risk warning as ESMA’s except for the case of new firms that do not have twelve months of retail client trading data where we request that the percentage range is replaced with a reference stating that:
“The vast majority of retail client accounts lose money when trading in CFDs” in the durable medium and webpage standard risk warning and in the abbreviated standard risk warning and with a reference stating that “CFD-retail client accounts generally lose money” in the reduced character standard risk warning.

Story 43
In ESMA’s view, the proposed leverage limit for CFDs referencing certain government bonds is not justified and proportionate.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has earlier today issued a set of opinions regarding proposed product intervention measures by national competent authorities, including the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). As FinanceFeeds has reported, the FCA has made changes to its Handbook regarding restrictions to offering of CFDs and CFD-like products to retail investors.
Overall, the measures outlined by the FCA were the same as those adopted by ESMA. And yet, there were some differences. Today, it became clear that ESMA does not agree with all the measures set forth by the UK regulator.
The national measures consist of a permanent restriction on the marketing, distribution or sale to retail clients in or from the UK of contracts for differences (CFDs) as well as products referred to by the FCA as ‘CFD-like options’.
The FCA informed ESMA that the national measures are the same as ESMA’s measures at national level, with the differences that the national measures would: (i) also capture products referred to by the FCA as ‘CFD like-options’, which are not included in ESMA’s measures; (ii) set a leverage limit of 30:1 for CFDs and CFD-like options referencing certain government bonds, instead of the 5:1 leverage limit provided for in ESMA’s measures; (iii) include minor amendments to the initial margin protection requirement in ESMA’s measures; (iv) include minor amendments to the risk warnings in ESMA’s measures.
Unlike ESMA’s measures, the national measures would capture CFD-like options. In ESMA’s measures, ESMA acknowledged that these products, despite differing in various respects from CFDs, also have similarities with CFDs and that ESMA and the NCAs would monitor whether detrimental consequences for retail clients similar to those observed in relation to CFDs would also arise in respect of products with similar or comparable features to CFDs. For the purposes of the national measures, ESMA has assessed the relevance of the FCA’s supervisory experience, in particular the evidence concerning the significant losses of UK retail clients when trading CFD-like options and the likelihood of the circumvention of the restrictions on CFDs by UK product providers. In the light of these national specificities, ESMA considers that it is justified and proportionate for the national measures to include CFD-like options.
In relation to the planned application of the restrictions on CFD-like options to all providers marketing those products in or from the UK and to UK providers and UK branches of providers authorised in other Member States distributing or selling those products in or from the UK, ESMA considers that the proposed distinction does not adequately address the consumer detriment which the FCA has observed for UK retail clients in respect of CFD-like options. That is because the distinction would still permit UK retail clients to trade CFD-like options with providers established in other Member States and experience significant losses. Therefore, ESMA considers that the restrictions on CFD-like option providers should be applied equally to providers authorised in the UK as well as to providers authorised in other Member States.
Therefore, according to ESMA, the FCA’s proposed application of the restrictions to CFD-like option providers authorised in other Member States only in respect of the marketing of CFD-like options, and not in respect of the sale or distribution of those products, is not justified and proportionate.
With regard to the proposed leverage limit of 30:1 for CFDs referencing certain government bonds, ESMA acknowledges that this proposal is based on quantitative analysis which follows a methodology consistent with the approach taken in ESMA’s measures, subject to available data, and that 30:1 does not exceed the highest leverage limit for other asset classes in ESMA’s measures, which may mitigate competition amongst providers that are subject to a stricter leverage limit.
However, in ESMA’s view the proposed leverage limit for CFDs referencing certain government bonds is not justified and proportionate. The proposed leverage limit, ESMA argues, would result in divergence from the leverage limits applied by product providers subject to other national measures under Article 42 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 based on ESMA’s measures.
With regard to the proposed minor amendments to the initial margin protection requirement in ESMA’s measures, ESMA considers these amendments to be consistent with its interpretation of the requirement. ESMA finds that the FCA’s proposed clarifications to the initial margin protection requirement in ESMA’s measures are justified and proportionate.
Finally, in respect of the differences in the risk warnings between the national measures and ESMA’s measures, ESMA considers that the proposed amendments to refer in the risk warnings also to CFD-like options is consistent with the FCA’s proposed extension of the national measures also to CFD-like options.
In conclusion, ESMA is of the opinion that the national measures are justified and proportionate except for:
(i) the FCA’s proposal not to apply the national restrictions to CFD-like option providers authorised in other Member States other than through a UK branch or tied agent in respect of the sale or distribution of those products to UK retail clients; and
(ii) the FCA’s proposal to apply a 30:1 leverage limit for CFDs referencing certain government bonds, instead of the 5:1 leverage limit in ESMA’s measures.
Although the opinion is partially negative, it is not certain that ESMA will be doing anything particular to force the FCA to change the new rules. The pan-EU regulator has already indicated that its powers are limited at a national level.

Story 44
The fact that the proposed restrictions will come into effect two months after the expiry of ESMA’s measures regarding CFDs seems not to bother the pan-EU watchdog.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has earlier today issued a positive opinion regarding the proposed permanent ban on the offering of binary options and restrictions on the offering of CFDs to retail investors in Slovenia.
This is barely surprising as ATVP – Slovenia’s Securities Market Agency, has informed ESMA that the national measures are the same as ESMA’s measures.
Importantly, the national measures are expected to take effect on October 1, 2019, whereas ESMA’s measures were not renewed and expired at the end of the day on July 31, 2019. The delay, however, does not seem to raise the concern of the Slovenian regulator and ESMA.
ATVP informed ESMA that it considers that the risk of unrestricted CFDs being offered again to retail clients during that time period would be very limited, also considering the size of the Slovenian market and the national measures of other Member States. Furthermore, the ATVP is not aware of any activity of CFD providers authorised in Slovenia providing their services in the Union and will closely monitor the market during that time period.
ESMA says that, with regard to the planned date for the national measures to take effect, it has taken into account the reasons provided by the ATVP on the very limited risk that unrestricted CFDs could be offered to retail clients before that date as well as the capacity of the ATVP to adequately monitor the market during that period and act as necessary.
ESMA is satisfied that the national measures are justified and proportionate.
ESMA has been critical of the CFD restriction measures proposed by some national regulators. Thus, for instance, ESMA has slammed Poland’s KNF because the Polish product intervention measures with regard to CFDs envisaged lower margin requirements for more experienced traders. ESMA stated that it does not consider that lowering margin requirements for experienced clients is appropriate. Nevertheless, Poland implemented the planned measures regardless of the stance of the pan-EU watchdog.

At the recently held grand finale of the Smart India Hackathon-2019 hardware edition, team STAC 1 from Ajeenkya DY Patil University, Pune, bagged Rs 1 lakh cash prize for its innovation under the theme ‘Robotics and Drone’.


Apart from STAC 1, Suvana from Muzaffarpur Institute of Technology, Muzaffarpur; and Quebik from Viva Institute of Technology, Maharashtra, and FORBOTS from Mar Baselios Institute of Technology and Science also received Rs 1 lakh each for their innovation.


They were among the 16 teams competing for the hackathon held at REVA University, Bengaluru, which was one of the 19 nodal centres in for the final round.


Team STAC 1 from Ajeenkya DY Patil University


Team STAC 1 paired a virtual reality (VR) headset with illuminating thumb controllers, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. According to the team, this will allow a company or service provider to visually show clients the company’s plans and outcomes in 3D.


It received largely positive reactions when the team, led by Pranshu Tople (20), demonstrated it at Ingersoll Rand at IBC Knowledge Park, recently. They are now working with the company and hoping to launch the product by September this year.
“The device can visually show a client how their end product will look like. For example, if an office wants to install AC, this device can be used to show how they are planning to build it and where the ACs will be installed before the work has begun,” Pallavi Saha, a team member, told YourStory.


She also explained that it can be applied in almost every field from something as complex as designing products like car and building architecture plans to simple recreational plans.


Other members of the team include Yatish Kumavat (20), Shubham Nandi (20), G Santosh (19), and Tanay Mitkari (21), all undergraduate students pursuing Mechatronics at Ajeenkya DY Patil University.


Their innovation is built on the understanding that clients have little idea of what might be delivered to them as most people do not understand the technical workings. As companies have a hard time walking them through the process, projects often end up in reworks and customer dissatisfaction, costing time and labour for both. STAC 1’s innovation will translate the complex analysis or plans and visually present it in 3D.


Soon, the team hopes to use other software like SolidWorks and AutoCAD, which will be more efficient, especially in architecture. According to the members, the ultimate aim is to set a benchmark for enhanced user experience.


Tracing steps in AR and VR


Student Technical Activity Club (STAC) was initially set up during the team's first year in college. Since then, the club has hosted multiple programmes, encouraging other students to take part in various robotics competitions and hackathons held across the country.
However, they explored augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) for the first time during their college fest ‘Hashtech’. For this, the students experimented with VR games such as killing zombies, which became a huge success at the university.
The team believes VR and AR are the next milestones in visualisations and interpretations. According to them, when the hardware edition of Smart India Hackathon (SIH) was announced, it felt like the right opportunity to explore more of the field, while also bridging gaps in the industry with their customer-centric product.
As undergraduate students, developing this technology was not an easy feat for them. A first of its kind, very few people had harnessed these tools before. But the team left no stone unturned, and approached YouTuber Matthew Hallberg, who runs a tutorial channel on topics like Apple ARkit, ARcore, machine learning (ML), and AR/VR, among others. The team also used various open-source material available to develop the tech.


Apart from AR and VR, the technology is built using image processing, i2c serial communication, and multiple programming languages to give it an edge.




The road ahead


Claiming that the system can benefit any organisation, industry, or service provider, the team hopes to become a household name in the industry when it comes to product planning and visualisation.


Speaking on their participation in the event, they said,


“It was a wonderful opportunity for us to present the work and be recognised by industry experts as well as the Government of India. Moreover, spending time with other participants coming up with innovative ideas, which if given the right platform can transform the world, has been absolutely fantastic.”


Expressing gratitude to the organisers, the group of young students said it will be a pleasure if they can give back to society and the country in any way.

The changes to the rules aim to reduce harm to retail consumers by ensuring that CFDs and restricted options are not sold with excessive risk features.
Following consultation in Consultation Paper (CP) 18/38, on June 27, 2019 the Board of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) made changes to the Handbook concerning the offering of CFDs to retail customers.
The amendments related to the Consultation Paper released in December 2018. In that paper, the FCA proposed permanent rules to require firms to:
limit leverage to between 30:1 and 2:1 by collecting minimum margin as a percentage of the overall exposure that the CFD provides;
close out a customer’s position when their funds fall to 50% of the margin needed to maintain their open positions on their CFD account;
provide protections that guarantee a client cannot lose more than the total funds in their CFD account;
stop offering monetary and non-monetary inducements to encourage trading, and
provide a standardised risk warning, which requires firms to tell potential customers the percentage of their retail client accounts that make losses.
The legislative piece which results in the latest amendments to the FCA Handbook is called Conduct of Business (Contracts for Difference) Instrument 2019. It amends Glossary COBS 22 and adds a new section to the Handbook: COBS 22.5.
In summary, this instrument makes changes to the Handbook to reduce harm to retail consumers by ensuring that CFDs and restricted options are not sold with excessive risk features, while still allowing sales to retail consumers who understand the risks and are capable of bearing potential trading losses. Retail consumers are expected to save between £267 million and £449 million per year from these measures.
The proposed interventions are the same in substance as ESMA’s, although the FCA is also proposing to apply its rules to closely substitutable products (the measures for CFDs will thus be applied to CFD-like options).
The FCA Handbook will define CFD-like options in line with a proposed new glossary definition of ‘restriction options’, which is intended to catch CFD-like options. The glossary definition covers options that include additional product features, which ensure the value of the option changes in a linear manner with the value of the underlying asset, excluding costs, charges, and spreads (ie the difference between the bid-price and ask-price). The scope is not intended to capture traditional or ‘vanilla’ options.
The most commonly traded CFD-like options are so-called ‘turbo certificates’. These products are more widely offered in other EEA jurisdictions by large wholesale banks. While they are similar to the CFDs typically offered in the UK market, they differ in that they:
may qualify as transferable securities and are sold with a prospectus that complies with the Prospectus Directive
are commonly traded on a trading venue, and
typically limit client’s losses to the amount initially invested.
FCA’s market intelligence suggests that there is currently little demand from UK consumers for these products. Only two FCA-authorised firms offer access to turbo certificates in the UK and there was £289.5 million in annual trading volume in 2017, which is relatively small compared to retail CFD trading volumes in the UK. Client outcomes from trading these products are similar to CFDs. According to firm data, 67% of retail client accounts lost money trading ‘turbo certificates’ and the average outcome from trading was a loss of £2,620.
Other CFD variations, which UK CFD providers have recently started offering, include ‘knock outs’ and ‘delta one options’.
A restricted option defines is defined as an option:
that is in the money at the point of sale;
where the value is determined by one-to-one fluctuations in the value or price of the underlying asset; and
for which the value is not significantly affected by the time to expiry.
The definition of restricted speculative investments after the amendments includes:
(1) contracts for differences;
(2) spread bets; and
(3) rolling spot forex contracts (other than a future in limb (a) of the Glossary definition of rolling spot forex contract).; and
(4) restricted options.
Part 1 of Annex A (amendments to glossary of definitions) and Part 1 of Annex B (amendments to COBS) of this instrument come into force on 1 August 2019 and Part 2 of Annex A and Part 2 of Annex B of this instrument come into force on 1 September 2019.

CySEC will then inform ESMA on the content of the national product intervention measures in order for ESMA to issue an Opinion on the proportionality of the restrictions.
Following the launch of the Consultation Paper on Imposing National Product Intervention Measures (“NPIMs”) to Restrict the Marketing, Distribution and Sale of Contracts for Difference (CFDs), and the closure of the Consultation on June 14, 2019, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) today announces that a decision on the content of the national intervention measures is expected to be reached by the end of July.
CySEC will then inform ESMA and other National Competent Authorities (NCAs) on the content of the measures so that ESMA may conduct its examination and issue an Opinion on the proportionality of the intended restrictions.
The ESMA restrictions on the CFD offering will expire on August 1, 2019. However, all Cyprus Investment Firms (CIFs) are told to continue applying the content of the measures under the ESMA Decision on CFDs irrespective of its deadline lapsing, until such time when the Cypriot measures are introduced – a process which is likely to take up to two months following the publication date of this Circular.
In particular, CIFs should comply with the content of the national product intervention measures adopted by other EU NCAs when marketing, distributing or selling CFDs in the territory of the respective Member State. Further, where a CIF markets, distributes or sells CFDs in the Republic of Cyprus or in the territory of a Member State that has not adopted national product intervention measures yet, or in a Third Country, it must abide by the content of the ESMA measures as if the measures were in force.
Let’s recall that, the Cypriot regulator wants to vary leverage caps for CFD trading depending on the type of retail investors. Put otherwise, some retail investors will see even harsher leverage restrictions than the ones introduced by ESMA, whereas others may see the restrictions relaxed.
According to CySEC, the ESMA Decision on CFDs does not distinguish between different subcategories of retails clients. MiFID II does not distinguish between different subcategories of retail clients either, but introduced the notion of target market. CySEC expects CFD providers will not sell such products to clients falling within the negative target market. However, CySEC cannot rule out the possibility that sales of such products might appear in the case of retail clients falling within the grey area of target market (i.e. those not falling neither within the positive target market nor within the negative target market).
CySEC also acknowledges that the term “retail client” encompasses different types of investors, with different levels of knowledge and financial position and the persons falling within the positive target market does not necessarily share the same level of knowledge and financial position.
For example, CySEC is proposing to introduce stricter leverage limits for retail clients falling within the ‘grey area’ of the target market, and affording slightly higher leverage limits for retail clients falling within the upper tier of the positive target market.

Story 49
ESMA does not consider that lowering margin requirements for experienced clients is appropriate.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has just published another set of opinions regarding the national measures aimed at restricting the offering of CFDs to retail clients of brokerages. The opinion regarding the Polish measures is particularly interesting.
The Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego of Poland (KNF) notified ESMA on June 28, 2019 of its intention to take product intervention measures.
The KNF informed ESMA that the national measures are the same as ESMA’s measures at national level, except that the national measures: (i) in the case of services provided from Poland in another Member State, would only apply in the absence of a related product intervention measure applicable to those services in the host Member State (reduced territorial scope); and (ii) in the case of services provided in Poland, would enable a new category of experienced clients to have lower initial margin requirements for two of the five types of underlying in ESMA’s measures (lower margin requirements for experienced clients). The national measures are expected to take effect on August 1, 2019.
In respect of the lower margin requirements, the KNF observed (i) a decrease in the number of active accounts of retail clients; (ii) a significant decrease in the trading volume by retail clients; and (iii) a decrease in the number of transactions carried out by retail clients. Surveys conducted by the KNF and by a Polish association of investment firms indicate that many Polish clients opened an account with a broker registered outside of the Union and that this was driven by the ability to access higher leverage. The KNF has concerns that such investors are not protected by the requirements of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 or Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) and have to operate in a foreign legal system, which may not provide equivalent protection.
The KNF proposes to subdivide the definition of a retail client by including a new category of ‘experienced client’ in its national measures. For experienced clients only, the national measures provide a lower initial margin requirement for the first two types of underlying referred to in points (a) and (b) of Annex 1 of ESMA’s measures, which are (i) main currency pairs; and (ii) other currency pairs, main equity indices and gold. In particular, instead of the initial margin percentages of 3,33% and 5% used in ESMA’s measures for these two types of underlying, the national measures propose an initial margin requirement of 1%.
In response, ESMA states that it does not consider that lowering margin requirements for experienced clients is appropriate. Excessive leverage was one of the major causes for consumer detriment that led to ESMA’s measures.
Furthermore, ESMA notes that Directive 2014/65/EU differentiates between retail clients and professional clients and lays down criteria that must be met for a retail client to become a professional client on request. When taking its measures, ESMA concluded that ESMA’s measures should apply in respect of all retail clients.
As confirmed by the KNF in its own analysis, there is no evidence that a specific subset of retail clients lose less money or lose less frequently when trading CFDs. Moreover, the KNF has not provided any evidence that a specific subset of retail clients differ systematically in their investment needs or risk tolerance. As such, ESMA has neither received evidence to support lower margin requirements for experienced clients in general nor for a specific sub-set of retail clients.
ESMA concludes that the national measures are justified and proportionate except for:
the reduced territorial scope; and
the lower margin requirements for experienced clients.
ESMA, however, does not make it clear whether it will take any particular action with regard to Poland given the specific Polish approach to CFD restrictions. It could be that the public scolding exhausts ESMA’s powers when it comes to intervening in the national policies. This has earlier been indicated in an ESMA newsletter.
Let’s also note that the Cypriot regulator has outlined proposals for CFD restrictions similar to those outlined by Poland’s KNF. According to CySEC, there have to be various sub-categories of retail traders and leverage has to vary across these sub-categories.

SPECIAL SCAFFOLD RESCUE @ 33 W ONTARIO ON 53RD OR 54TH FL Special operations secured victim hauled to roof and secured without issue. — Chicago Fire Media (@CFDMedia) August 20, 2019
CHICAGO (WLS) -- A scary and tense moment was caught on video Tuesday as a window washer dangled more than 50 stories in the sky off a downtown high-rise.The incident all unfolded near Ontario and Dearborn streets in Chicago's River North neighborhood.Calls to 911 began around noon, with help arriving a short time later. Emergency officials responded to 33 West Ontario to find the 30-year-old window washer holding on for dear life to the side of the nearly 60 story skyscraper."He was up there working and he had two lines on him," said Chicago Fire Department Battalion Chief Brian McCardle. "His main line broke and his second line grabbed him, but he fell two stories in that time frame."The window washer was using a swing harness while cleaning the windows and the free fall stopped between the 53rd and 54th floor."[Rescuers] go off a rope and they go down. They swing from one side of the building to the other side of the building and do each window," said Chicago Fire Department District Chief Thomas Carbonneau.The CFD's high angle rescue team went to work as bad weather and heavy rain storms moved in."We immediately went to the floor where he was calling from and talked to him right away. We're able to give him a short, 'juno' we call it, to hold him in place to give him a little bit more security," said Chicago Fire Department Captain Salvatore Mastrodomenico.The man was pulled to safety after about 25 very intense minutes as onlookers like Priscilla Williams watched the incident unfold."I know that's a dangerous job. One I wouldn't want but I can definitively, I give it to him," said Williams.

By a general administrative act, the regulator has stipulated that CFDs with an additional payments obligation are to remain prohibited.
The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany (BaFin) has earlier today announced that it will maintain the restrictions on the marketing, distribution and sale of financial CFDs to retail clients in Germany. By a general administrative act, the regulator has stipulated that contracts with an additional payments obligation are to remain prohibited. Germany’s supervisor has also specified maximum permissible leverage, negative balance protection, a restriction on the incentives offered to trade CFDs and a requirement for risk warnings.
In taking this step, BaFin is once again addressing the considerable investor protection concerns expressed at the time of its initial prohibition regarding CFDs with an additional payments obligation. This prohibition was introduced in May 2017. BaFin considers these CFDs in particular to carry an incalculable risk of loss for retail investors. Losses are not limited to the client’s capital investment but instead may encompass the entirety of their assets and can amount to multiples of the invested capital.
In order to further reduce the risks for retail investors, the leverage limits and other negative balance protections stipulated by ESMA will also continue to apply in Germany. Upon expiry of this measure, the level of protection in Germany will be aligned with the European standard by means of BaFin’s General Administrative Act. According to BaFin, standardised risk warnings are essential as well. The supervisor also maintains that retail investors must not be encouraged to enter into the risks associated with CFDs through initial credit, discounts, bonuses or other incentives.
One can view the restrictions on leverage in the table below:
Further, CFD brokerages must ensure that CFDs are automatically closed in the event of significant negative price performance. This protective mechanism takes effect when the value of a CFD equals less than half of the investor’s initial margin (margin close-out rule).
The trading companies must also guarantee that investors cannot lose more than the value of their initial margin (negative balance protection). Retail investors are therefore not required to make additional payments.
If offerers advertise CFDs to retail investors, they must expressly state how many private customers lose money with the products (risk warnings).

Story 52
The decision is explained via the national prohibitions implemented by most national competent authorities.
In a move that has been expected for a while, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU securities markets’ regulator, today announces it will not renew the temporary prohibition of the marketing, distribution or sale of binary options to retail clients in the European Union (EU).
The halt has been indicated by several national competent authorities (NCAs), such as BaFin, which has earlier today commented that it will maintain the national ban on binary options as ESMA will not renew the temporary measures.
Further, ESMA has been lately issuing a raft of positive opinions regarding the ban on binary options introduced by many NCAs. The latest regulators to get such a positive opinion include Cyprus, to mention one (important) example.
ESMA has taken product intervention measures regarding binary options, imposing a temporary prohibition on their marketing, distribution or sale, in Decisions (EU) 2018/795, (EU) 2018/1466, (EU) 2018/2064 and (EU) 2019/509. If the temporary prohibition is not renewed again, the currently applicable measure in ESMA Decision (EU) 2019/509 will automatically expire at the end of the day on July 1, 2019.
As most national competent authorities (NCAs) have taken permanent national product intervention measures relating to binary options that are at least as stringent as ESMA’s measure, ESMA will not renew its temporary prohibition, the regulator said.
ESMA will continue to monitor activities in relation to these and other related speculative products to determine whether any other EU-wide measures may be needed.
The FinanceFeeds team is curious to see how ESMA would treat its product intervention measures given that these restrictions have triggered a rather controversial reaction. Moreover, CySEC has dared to question ESMA’s approach to determining an investor as a retail one. Let’s recall that the Cypriot regulator has offered various leverage caps for various types of retail investors. Perhaps ESMA really needs to consider refining its approach regarding the regulation of CFD trading.

Professional services and management consultancy giant Deloitte has been instructed by a commercial client to send a survey to CFD and FX traders regarding the proposals by ASIC on the reformation of how CFD products are sold in Australia by retail brokerages
Deloitte, one of the ‘big four’ global professional services consultancies, has today issued a survey to collate the viewpoints of retail traders and partners with regard to the proposals released last month by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) which have been met with a reactive reception by stakeholders.
In August, ASIC released a very detailed proposal in which the regulator demonstrated its clear intention to restrict the methods by which OTC CFDs are sold.
Currently, spot FX is not covered under the proposals, as ASIC has made its stance clear that, as far as regulatory research is concerned, its officials believe that a very high percentage of retail clients have been closed out of positions by their CFD provider automatically at low margin levels.
FinanceFeeds received the survey in a notice from Australian FX and CFD brokerage FP Markets via an introducing broker in Australia. The brokerage today approached its partners, customers and potential clients via email saying “In August 2019, ASIC released a consultation paper that outlined a number of proposed changes that will affect the way clients can trade Forex and CFDs.”
“We would appreciate any feedback that you can provide by completing the survey below. The survey should only take 2-3 minutes of your time and will be completely anonymous” said FP Markets’ mail to interested parties.
There is a link to click at the bottom of the email to launch the survey, which then takes users to a specific landing page on Deloitte’s Australian website.
Once open , the survey’s landing page states that Deloitte is assisting a client in the CFD industry in Australia to respond to the Australian Securities & Investments Commission’s (ASIC) proposed intervention in the markets for over-the-counter (OTC) binary options and contracts for difference (CFDs).
The content of the survey involves a multiple choice questionnaire which asks traders and IBs to state how long they have been trading for, level of expertise, and the level of leverage they use most often.
It then goes on to ask that if these caps are implemented, how a trader would react, including possibly changing their trading behavior or broker, changing the size of trades, changing the number of trades, or changing to a broker that offers higher leverage.
It then asks traders to consider what they would do if ASIC introduces negative balance protection, and at what level, if any, do traders think that margin close-out protection for retail clients’ should apply. It also asks respondents to state their annual income bracket.
The possible answers for this include if the trading account margin falls to 50% then trades should be progressively closed out, or if the margin falls to 20% the trades should be progressively closed out, or a third answer stating ‘at no level at all.’
Deloitte states that the purpose of this survey is to gather responses from the industry to assist in the preparation of a report which will accompany a submission to ASIC on the impacts of the proposed product intervention on the retail clients.
If you choose to participate, Deloitte will collect some Personal Information about you, such as your email and pay bracket. The survey results will be shared with our client in the form of a report. This report may be further provided to ASIC who may make the results publicly available. Your response will be aggregated into groups and will not be reported on if they contain less than six responses. As a result, your answers will not identify you individually.
The survey will take approximately 5 minutes to complete, is voluntary and anonymous and participants can come back to the survey at any time as long as you are using the same phone or computer.
The survey will close on Tuesday 24 September at 12am (midnight) AEST.
This survey is conducted using Dtermine, Deloittes survey partner. The company states that anyone experiencing problems in answering the survey please contact Deloitte at dtermine@deloitte.com.au

Since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 GBPUSD, EURGBP and other pound sterling forex pairs have been attractive instruments for news traders, who base their strategies on political and macroeconomic events, as well as for the technical traders. In the next two months, things are going to get even better as the volatility will increase with the Brexit deadline approaching.

What makes Brexit exciting for forex traders are the uncertainties. There is just one thing sure after the referendum in June 2016. The UK is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019.
Here's the one-week GBP/USD chart. The horizontal line marks the week of the Brexit referendum. The British pound has been the most volatile developed market currency since the June 2016 Brexit referendum, still not as explosive as USD/ZAR, USD/TRY or USD/HUF.
A one-week GBP/USD chart, source: SimpleFX WebTrader
Possible scenarios
We don't know the terms the UK is going to exit the EU. We don't know if they are going to leave at all. Theresa May's government has a challenging task of pleasing her party's core supporters, who are in favor of Brexit, the majority of the population, who seem to be against it now, the global investors, local businesses, and more.
With a temporary “no deal” the GBP could drop. In the temporary “no deal” scenario the UK accepts paying some amount to the UE in the transition period.
A hard "no deal" scenario seems unlikely since it would be too risky for both politicians and British companies as it would bring too much disruption to imports and exports and travel delays.
A Withdrawal Bill and trade agreement is a scenario where the UK stays as an integral part of the European single market and the transition period lasts until December 2020.
A second referendum is an event the UK government says "no" to at the moment. However, this may change in the future. The polls are suggesting the majority of people would vote in favor of staying in the EU.
Interesting GBP pairs to trade
GBP/USD
The fundamentals would suggest that GBP/USD at 1.30 is a little bit low. Traders could seek for signs of some positive Brexit scenarios and include this upside in their long term strategies.
GBP/USD one-day chart, source: SimpleFX WebTrader
When analyzing this pair, you should remember about the USD macroeconomic background. Donald Trump's presidency brings a lot of political uncertainty and forex volatility.
Nevertheless, USD had a healthy 2018, when it appreciated. However, it seems to slow down recently as fiscal, and current account deficits are looming. On the other hand, tax cuts and deregulation should have a positive impact on the GDP growth in the next years.
The long-term dollar is expected to weaken as the Federal Reserve's rate hiking cycle, and balance sheet tapering stops. The US will start to face the financial reality of fiscal and current account deficits that are beginning to increasingly strain the country's finances and become a drag on growth.
EUR/GBP
The two economies are involved directly in the Brexit saga. The deal or no deal dilemma affects the two sides directly. No wonder the pair has been a rollercoaster recently.
EUR/GBP one-day chart, source: SimpleFX WebTrader
The same uncertainties affect both sides here, so it was possible that despite the turmoil in the UK government, where Theresa May was on a brink of losing the no-confidence vote, the British Pound gained over 1 percent last week.
GBP/JPY

The Japanese Yen is a safe haven currency that investors buy during times of global market uncertainty. If you want to base your strategy on your perception of the British-centered events and data concerning the British economy you could try trading GBPJPY.
However you should remember that Japan also has its worries, there are some concerns about the inflation in Japan. If you want to trade GDB against a stable currency Swiss Franc (CHF) could be a nice alternative.
GBP/AUD
The Australian dollar is an interesting choice if you are looking for some more volatility and want to trade away from EUR, USD or JPY. The Australian economy is on the outskirts of the leading global power hubs. It's closely connected to the UK but increasingly closer to Asia.
GBP/AUD one-day chart, source: SimpleFX WebTrader
If you want to build your trading strategy around global geopolitics and macroeconomic trends and benefit from the Brexit uncertainties, Australian Dollar may be a good pair for the pound sterling.
Take advantage of the unique opportunity
We are entering the peak of Brexit uncertainty, and this means it may be the best period to trade British pound. Make sure you don't miss this opportunity and try to ride the GBP roller-coaster.
Get down to it now; there's no time to waste. If you are a beginner forex trader try putting your pound sterling strategies into action with a demo account, and then move to trade on a live account with no minimum deposits. If you have some experience, you may try to make some real money during the upcoming days.
Good luck trading pound during the uncertain times surrounding the Brexit deadline!

With hundreds, if not thousands of online brokers now allowing you to trade a full range of assets at a click of a button, knowing which platform to go with can be a difficult task. While some traders will seek to find the most user-friendly platform on the market, others prefer brokers with super-low fees.
With that being said, the likes of eToro have grown exponentially over the past few years. With the online broker now claiming to service over 10 million users from all over the world, we sought to explore just what all the fuss is all about.
As such, if you’re thinking about using eToro for your online trading needs, be sure to read our comprehensive guide.
We’ve covered everything that you need to know – such as how the platform works, what assets it allows you trade, fees, regulation, and more.
Let’s start by finding out what eToro actually is.
Visit eToro
CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 75% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work, and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.
What is eToro?
eToro is an online broker that allows you to buy, sell and trade thousands of financial instruments. Launched in 2017 and now headquartered in Cyprus, the platform initially focused exclusively on CFDs (contracts for difference).
However, the platform has since expanded into other areas of the online brokerage space – subsequently allowing users to actually own the assets they invest in.
At the time of writing, this includes traditional stock market equities and cryptocurrencies. In terms of its CFD offering, this includes everything from forex, stock market indices, ETFs, commodities, and more.
One of the overarching benefits of using a platform like eToro is that the broker is suitable for newbie traders. As such – irrespective of your experience, buying and selling assets via the eToro website is as simple as it gets. Furthermore – and perhaps most importantly, eToro was one of the first pioneers of the social trading phenomenon.
Not only does this allow everyday investors to share, discuss and debate portfolio strategies – but via the Copy Trading feature, inexperienced traders can copy the trades of other investors like-for-like. It is this, alongside the vast number of financial instruments available at the platform, that has made eToro one of the fastest-growing online stock brokers in recent years.
In terms of its regulatory status – eToro is authorized by three key financial bodies. In its home jurisdiction of Cyprus, this includes the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). However, the more stringent authorization of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) are potentially more notable.
Finally, it is also important to mention that – fully in-line with the platform’s target market of newbie traders, eToro supports a huge number of everyday payment methods. While this includes traditional debit/credit cards and bank account transfers, the platform also hosts e-wallets such as PayPal and Skrill.
So now that you have an idea as to what eToro is, in the next part of our review we are going to further explore the types of financial instruments that you can invest in.
What Assets can you buy and Sell at Etoro?
First and foremost – and as we briefly discussed earlier, eToro was originally focused on CFDs, and CFDs only. As a result, there is still a misconception in the public domain that irrespective of the financial instrument you are investing in, you do not actually own the asset. This couldn’t be further from the truth, at least with respect to stocks and cryptocurrencies.
Let’s break this down in more detail.
Stocks and Shares
In a nutshell, when you purchase traditional stocks and shares via eToro, you maintain full ownership of the assets – much in the same way as you would with any other conventional stock broker operating in the space. As such, by purchasing stocks and shares at eToro, you will be accustomed to dividend payments, if applicable.
This is a very important differentiator, not least because previously, you could only invest in stocks and shares that were represented by CFDs. Although we will discuss the CFD department at eToro in more detail further down, this meant that you could only speculate on the movement of equities, as opposed to actually owning them.
However, it is important to mention a couple of fundamental conditions for the above to remain constant.
To own the underlying stock, you must ‘Go Long’, as opposed to ‘Going Short’. This means that you purchase stocks in the traditional way, rather than speculating that the value of the stock will go down. If you do want to go short, you will be investing in a CFD. To own the underlying stock, you must not apply leverage. If you do want to utilize leverage within your stock trades, then you will be investing in CFDs.
In terms of the types of stocks and shares that you can invest in, eToro lists thousands of individual equities listed on multiple stock market exchanges. This includes popular markets such as the NASDAQ and NYSE in the US, the London Stock Exchange, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The platform also has a presence in less popular stock markets, such as those based in Spain and Sweden.
Cryptocurrencies
The reason that we have decided to discuss cryptocurrencies before other, more traditional asset classes, is that digital currencies are the only other financial instrument that you can own outright at eToro.
Take note, although you technically own the underlying cryptocurrency – as opposed to simply holding a CFD, you won’t be able to withdraw your coins to an external wallet.
If you wish to withdraw cryptos to your own wallet you will need to use a full exchange such as :
However, we would argue that the regulatory safeguards that come with an eToro account are potentially more secure than utilizing a private wallet – especially if you are a beginner.
Nevertheless, much like in the case of stocks and shares, you will only own the underlying digital currency if you [A] go long, as opposed to short and [B] do not apply any leverage. Once again, if you don’t meet the above requirements, you will instead be investing in CFDs.
In terms of what cryptocurrencies you can buy and sell at eToro, this covers 16 crypto-to-dollar pairs such as BTC/USD, ETH/USD and BTC/USD. You can also trade cryptocurrencies against a number of other base fiat currencies, such as EUR, GBP, and JPY.
For those of you that want to trade crypto-cross pairs, eToro also has you covered. This includes the likes of ETH/EOS, BTC/EOS, and BTC/ETH.
Forex
One of the most widely used segments of the eToro platform is that of its forex department. In fact, the platform hosts dozens of tradable currency pairs across the major, minor, and exotic threshold.
While all major and minor pairs are covered, eToro offers a comprehensive number of less popular cross-pairs. This includes the likes of CFD/HUF, EUR/PLN, USD/MXN, and ZAR/JPY.
Indices
If you’re looking to mitigate your risk by investing in the wider stock markets, then you’ll be pleased to know that eToro lists 13 individual indices. The most popular markets listed include the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, FTSE 100, and China 50.
eToro also covers stock market indices from Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, France, and Germany.
ETFs
At the time of writing, eToro lists 145 ETFs from a range of different sectors. This includes ETFs facilitated by well-known institutions such as iShares and Vanguard.
Commodities
Finally, if you’re looking for exposure to the highly volatile world of commodities, you have six assets to choose from. This includes oil, gold, silver, copper, natural gas, and platinum.
eToro Fees

So now that we’ve discussed the ins and outs of what you can trade at eToro, we now need to explore how much it costs to trade. First and foremost, it is important to note that eToro does not charge any commissions or trading fees. However, this doesn’t mean that you will be trading for free. On the contrary, you will pay your fees in the form of the spread.
For those unaware, the spread is the difference between the;
Bid Price: the highest price that buyers are willing to pay for a financial instrument
And the;
Sell Price: the lowest price that sellers are willing to sell a financial instrument.
Without intending to digress, it is super important for you to understand how the spread works, not least because this will have a major impact on the fees you pay at eToro.
To assist, we’ve listed a quick example below.
Let’s say that you are looking to invest in Apple stocks. Upon accessing the market on eToro, you see that the bid price is $200, and the ask price is $210. As such, we then need to divide the bid price into the ask price, which gives us just over 0.95. We then subtract the above calculation from 1, which leaves us 0.05. In percentage terms, this means that the spread is 5%.
As noted above, this is how your eToro fees will work. If, for example, the spread was in fact 5%, this means that the market would need to go in your favor by 5% just to break even. The key problem with this is that eToro does not make the spread fees clear. Instead, you would need to repeat the above calculation to assess how much you are paying.
Nevertheless, to give you a rough idea, major crypto-to-dollar pairs come with an average spread of approximately 1.5%, while crypto-crosses can be as high as 5%. Stocks and ETFs are much lower, rarely surpassing 0.5%. However, less common marketplaces such as those in Spain and France will come with a much higher spread.
Leverage and Overnight Fees
If you are looking to apply leverage to your eToro trades, the amount that you are able to get will depend on the type of financial asset you are trading, as well as your specific location. For example, traders based within the European Union will often be capped to just 1:2 on cryptocurrencies, and 1:5 on traditional blue-chip stocks.
Nevertheless, if you do apply leverage, you will, of course, need to pay an overnight financing fee. Although this varies quite considerably based on the specific financial instrument you want to trade, what we do like is that eToro is very transparent on its overnight financing charges.
When you set-up your trading parametres to include leverage, eToro will give you a breakdown of how much you will pay per day. This includes one rate for Monday-to-Friday, and another rate for holding open trades over the weekend.
So now that we’ve covered the main trading fee structure, in the next section we are going to cover deposits and withdrawals.
Deposits and Withdrawals at eToro
If you’re looking for a broad range of deposit and withdrawal options, eToro has you covered. In terms of funding your account, eToro accepts traditional debit/credit cards, bank wires, PayPal, Skrill, WebMoney, and more. All deposits and free, which is great. Moreover, unless you are performing a conventional bank transfer, most other deposit types are credited instantly.
When it comes to withdrawals, eToro will only consider withdrawals of $50 or more. Regardless of the type of payment method that you opt for, withdrawals come with a $25 fee. In the vast majority of cases, the payments team at eToro will process withdrawal requests within 3 working days. Once they do, the amount of time it will take for you to receive your funds will depend on your chosen payment method.
Social and Copy Trading
We really like the social trading feature that is available at eToro. In a nutshell, the platform has a somewhat ‘Social Media’ feel to it, insofar that investors can communicate with one another in a public setting. For example, if the price of Gold suddenly dropped by 2%, users can share their insights as to why this happened, and where the market is destined to head next.
Moreover, social trading also allows you to view the results of other traders. Not only does this display each and every trade that the investor in question has made, but you can also view the investor’s portfolio. Take note, if you don’t feel comfortable allowing other users to view your statistics or portfolio, you can switch this off at any time.
On top of social trading, eToro is also well-known for its copy trading feature. As we noted earlier, this allows you to copy the exact portfolio of your chosen investor(s), like-for-like. The copy feature places trades for you automatically, proportionate to how much you want to stake.
For example, if the trader you are copying has a $30,000 portfolio, but you only want to invest $3,000 – then the size of each asset within the portfolio will be split accordingly.
Opening an Account at eToro
A further benefit to choosing eToro over traditional, more established online brokers, is that the account registration process is super easy. If you have all of the required information to hand, you could get the account opened within less than 15 minutes.
In order to get started, you will need to head over to the official eToro homepage and click on the ‘JOIN NOW’ button. This will require you to enter some personal information, such as your full name, home address, telephone number, date of birth, and email address.
As is industry standard in the online brokerage space, you will also need to provide some information on your current financial standing, your experience of trading, and your attitude to risk. These questions are designed to ensure that eToro remains fully compliant with its licensing bodies, and that you understand the risks associated with trading – especially if you’re looking to invest in CFDs.
Here’s a breakdown of some of the main questions that you will need to answer in order to satisfy eToro.
How much experience you have in trading
Your knowledge in trading
What investments you plan to make
Your overall purpose of using eToro to trade
What your tolerance to risk is
What your current financial standing is like
Details about your net worth
Once again, although the above questions might appear intrusive, this is standard in the online broker arena.
KYC
Once you have completed the main account registration process, you will then need to go through a somewhat basic KYC (know your customer) program. This is to ensure that the platform meets its anti-money laundering and terrorist financing obligations.
Firstly, you will need to upload a copy of your government-issued ID. This will either need to be a passport, driver’s license, or national ID card. You will also need to upload a recent proof of address, such as a utility bill or bank statement.
Once you complete the speedy KYC process, you’re good to start trading.
Regulation and Security
One of the most important factors to consider when joining a new brokerage platform is its regulatory status. As we mentioned above, eToro is currently regulated on three main fronts. This includes;
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)
UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)
eToro complies with all respect jurisdictional laws, especially with regards to anti-money laundering and data protection. Furthermore, all client funds are held in segregated bank accounts with tier-one financial institutions.
In terms of account security, this is a bit thin on the ground from the perspective of the account holder. Although two-factor authentication is an option, nothing else really stands out. However, eToro does employ a fully-fledged, in-house security team to ensure that your account remains safe at all times.
What Languages Does eToro Support?
As a platform that operates in more than 140 jurisdictions, eToro is now available in 14 different languages. This includes;
Arabic
Chinese
Dutch
English
French
German
Italian
Polish
Portuguese
Russian
Spanish
Swedish
Norwegian
Malay
Customer Service and Public Reviews
If you need to contact somebody from the eToro customer support team, your best bet is to use the live chat facility. This is operational on a 24/5 basis – meaning if you need help over the weekend hours, you’re out of luck.
This is quite a poor offering from a platform that claims to serve more than 10 million customers. Although it is true that the traditional financial markets only operate during the week, the likes of forex and cryptocurrencies trade 24/7.
Moreover, unless you are based in Australia, you won’t have access to a dedicated telephone support line.
In terms of its reputation in the public domain, this is largely positive. However, the platform does have a rather lousy TurstPilot rating of just 2.5/5. When we explored the negative TrustPilot rating in more detail, this mainly centred on the overly basic nature of the trading arena, alongside above-average fees.
eToro Mobile Application
If you’re somebody that likes the option of trading on the move, you’ll be pleased to know that a native eToro mobile application is available on both iOS and Android devices. Anything outside of these two operating systems will require you to use the standard mobile web browser version of the platform.
Nevertheless, the mobile application is just as user-friendly as the main desktop site, and you can perform the vast majority of account functions. This, of course, includes trading, as well as deposits and withdrawals.
The eToro app on Google Play has a very impressive user rating of 4.2/5, which is across almost 24,000 individual reviews. Over at the Apple Store, this is a more impressive 4.7/5, although this only covers 35 reviews.
eToro Review: The Bottom Line?
In summary, it’s clear to see why eToro is now only of the fastest growing brokers in the online trading space. Not only is the platform super easy to use, but it hosts thousands of tradable instruments. While much of the assets hosted are in the form of CFDs, you can own both blue-chip stocks and cryptocurrencies outright.
In terms of supported payment methods, this is also a plus-point, as eToro allows you to deposit funds with a debit/credit card, bank account, e-wallet, and more. The fact that the platform also holds licenses with three regulatory bodies adds further weight to the broker’s dedication to protecting customer funds.
On the other hand, it must also be noted that trading at eToro is not cheap. While it is true that you will not pay any commissions or fees per-say, the platform more than makes up for this with its above-average spreads. However, this is the price that you will have to pay if you want to benefit from the many benefits that eToro offers.

(Editor’s note: Story by Susan Kanode/Frontier Days)
CHEYENNE, Wyo. – History was made on Championship Sunday of the 123rd Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo (CFD.) While this year’s rodeo debuted a tournament-style competition format, some familiar faces rode into the winner’s circle.
Local favorite Brody Cress became the first saddle bronc rider to win three consecutive CFD championships when he rode Stace Smith Pro Rodeo’s bucking horse Resistol’s Top Hat for 87.5 points.
Saddle bronc began in Cheyenne in 1897 and only Earl Thode, who won four titles between 1927 and 1934, has more wins here than Cress. Hall of fame cowboy Turk Greenough won three in the 1930s and 13-time Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR) cowboy Cody DeMoss has won three beginning in the 21st century.
Cress, whose hometown is nearby Hillsdale, extended the traditional winner’s victory ride on horseback around the arena to three full laps – one for each of his titles. The cheers from the crowd grew louder with each trip.
“Frank (Thompson-the CFD arena director) told me to make three laps,” Cress said with a smile. “I’ve been listening to Frank my whole life, so I wasn’t going to stop now.”
The $12,585 Cress won in Frontier Park will help him on his quest for a third consecutive NFR qualification. He is currently ranked 28th and needs to be among the top 15 on September 30 to return to Las Vegas.
Dustin Bird of Cut Bank, Montana, and Trey Yates of Pueblo, Colorado, are the 2019 team roping champions in Cheyenne. They won the final round in 7.8 seconds and each won just under $12,000. Bird is a former NFR qualifier, and Yates is the 2018 collegiate champion who roped at his first NFR last December. Their paychecks in Cheyenne will jump Yates into the top 20 in the heeling standings and put Bird in the top 30 in the heading.
Nellie Miller of Cottonwood, California, became the first barrel racer since Kristie Peterson in 1998 to successfully defend her CFD championship. The 2017 world champion, who is currently ranked second in the 2019 standings, won $20,697 dollars in Frontier Park, making her the highest money winner of the rodeo.
“This is such a traditional-filled rodeo,” Miller said. “It’s so special to win here. My horse loves big pens and she runs well here.”
She rode the blue roan mare named Rafter W Minnie Reba (called Sister) that she raised and trained. They rounded the pattern in 17.22 seconds, an identical time to that set by Shali Lord of Lamar, Colorado, seven runs earlier. While both women shared the final round’s first and second place prize money, Miller won the tiebreaker to be crowned champion based on having the fastest time in the earlier rounds.
The 19-year-old professional rodeo rookie sensation Stetson Wright of Milford, Utah, has begun carving out his own place in the CFD record books. Wright became the first rough stock cowboy to win the all-around title at the Daddy of ‘em All since Chad Eubank in 2007 won money in bareback and bull riding.
Wright qualified for Championship Sunday in both saddle bronc riding and bull riding. He thought his shot at the all-around title might have slipped away when he bucked off Stace Smith Pro Rodeo’s saddle bronc Utopia. But the money he had earned in the quarterfinals and semifinals in saddle bronc riding still counted toward the all-around.
The defeat in the bronc riding made Wright more determined to do well in bull riding, his favorite event. When the day began, he was second in the world championship standings, just about $16,000 behind five-time world champion bull rider Sage Kimzey.
Parker McCown of Montgomery, Texas, set the bar high when he scored 90 points on Stace Smith Pro Rodeo’s bull Hacksaw Ridge. Wright was the next-to-last cowboy to compete and he came within a single point of the CFD bull riding record with 93 points on Dakota Rodeo’s bull Safety Meeting.
That earned Wright both the bull riding and the all-around championship and his own place in the record books. Wright comes from a legendary bronc riding family. He is the third-oldest son of two-time world champion Cody Wright; the brother of world champion Ryder and NFR bronc rider Rusty; the nephew of world champions Spencer and Jesse; and three other uncles have qualified for the NFR in bronc riding.
“I’d have figured one of them would have won it before now,” he said. “What really means the most to me is to be the first member of my family to win a title here.”
Wright, who turns 20 on Tuesday, won just over $16,000 in two events with more than $13,000 from bull riding.
Clayton Biglow of Clements, California, was the final bareback rider to compete. Former CFD champ Richmond Champion has just scored 89.5 points on Sankey Pro Rodeo’s Prairie Rose, so Biglow knew he needed 90 points or more to win the title and he delivered.
He made a wild ride on Stace Smith Pro Rodeo’s bucking horse Witchy Woman and earned 91 points from the judges to win his first CFD title in four tries.
2019 has been Biglow’s best rodeo season thus far. He is ranked second in the world championship standings, about $27,000 behind four-time world champion Kaycee Field. The nearly $12,000 he earned in Frontier Park will help keep him within striking distance as the pro rodeo season begins its final two months.
The Cheyenne crowd had a chance to cheer for more than one local winner. Steer roper Trey Sheets grew up in western Nebraska and has made Cheyenne his home for the past seven years. He had the second-fastest time of the finals, but the championship in this event was awarded in the traditional format of total time on three runs. His 45.6 seconds was the best by four seconds.
In tie-down roping and steer wrestling, one of the first cowboys to compete in the finals set a pace that could not be beaten. Seth Hall of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was the second roper and his time of 10.5 seconds earned the championship. Hall has competed at CFD about eight times but had only made the finals once before-in 2012.
“This is almost more than amazing,” Hall said of earning the championship in Frontier Park.
Eli Lord was the first steer wrestler to ride out from CFD’s Chute 9 and he stopped the clock in 6.9 seconds. The next 15 competitors got no closer than two seconds to Lord’s time. He credits his hazer, Linn Churchill, a former CFD steer wrestling champion with helping him win the title. Lord is the third CFD champion that Churchill has assisted.
Frontier Days added women’s breakaway roping for the first time and drew 242 entries. When the tournament-style competition ended, seven of the 16 ropers in the championship round turned in times in the four-second range.
Jordan Jo Fabrizio of Canyon, Texas, was the fastest of the seven – 4.18 seconds. She is the first breakaway roping in the CFD record book with winnings of more than $17,500.
“All of the breakaway ropers took time to take a group photo in front of the grandstand before the finals today and it really hit me how historic this is,” she said. “This will be something I’ll never forget and always treasure.”
Fabrizio took inspiration from the buckle she wore, a CFD champion tie-down roping buckle won by Raymond Hollabaugh in 1983. Fabrizio spent five years competing in college rodeo for West Texas A & M University where Hollabaugh is the coach.
Plans are already underway for the 124th edition of Cheyenne Frontier Days scheduled for July 2020.

McLaren's new technical director James Key says the completion of a new wind tunnel facility at the team's headquarters in Woking is a crucial element in ensuring McLaren's sustained resurgence.
“It was very important," Key told the official Formula 1 website of the decision to find a replacement for Toyota's existing wind tunnel in Cologne, Germany, which the team has been using for over a decade.
Key said that a new wind tunnel had been at the top of his wish list when he was recruited from Toro Rosso to take up his new role. It was also a priority for the new team principal Andreas Seidl.
"I think when Andreas and I joined it was one of the big projects," said Key. "[It] was kind of on the table but needed to be rationalised and discussed, and that’s exactly what we did.
"There were options, but the most logical option was to have a new facility in our premises in Woking. We had a very positive and proactive, supportive response from our shareholders [about the cost]."
Key acknowledged that the existing facility in Germany was still "providing us with a very good service", but added that the time had come to move on.
“We’ve had a great relationship with Toyota over the last ten years the team’s been with them," he said. "But the fact is that tunnel is ageing now compared to the state-of-the-art ones in many Formula 1 teams."
Even with the availability of computer simulations and CFD (computational fluid dynamics), Key felt that there was currently no substitute for practical testing when it came to aerodynamics.
"The technology that is in a modern F1 wind tunnel is outstanding," Key explained. "It’s one of those little secrets that gets hidden away.
"If you ever get to see one and see what’s going on, there’s a huge amount of technology and interesting techniques and methodologies surrounding the way you now wind tunnel test.
“CFD and wind tunnels complement each other very well, particularly in motor racing when you’ve got a very chaotic situation," he continued. “The car’s moving around all over the place, it’s got rotating tyres and an airstream, there’s a lot of complexity there.
"CFD does an increasingly great job of understanding how those flows are working and demonstrating to us as engineers what’s going on. But they can’t do that live in multiple conditions in the space of 10 minutes, and a wind tunnel can.
"Although CFD will get there eventually, beginning to recreate exactly what a tunnel can do is still some way off. I guess we’re looking at new generations of technology and techniques."
In the meantime, Key hopes that the brand new, more advanced wind tunnel at McLaren Technology Centre will help ensure the team stays ahead of its mid-field rivals.
Currently in fourth place in the constructor standings, McLaren are now looking at ways of closing the gap to the top three teams in forthcoming seasons - Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull.
'To try and make genuine progress in the future, we needed something so critical to our performance closer to home," he said. "To try and take the team forth we had to try and match the competition."

ASIC is worried that some AFS licensees may be soliciting clients located in China and Europe to open accounts with Australian-based brokers in an effort to avoid overseas intervention measures.
Recent changes concerning CFD and binary options regulations in Europe have not gone unnoticed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). It is apparent that the conditions for offering CFDs to retail clients in Europe and Australia have become markedly different after the implementation of the product intervention measures by ESMA.
Whereas the CFD offering in Europe is now restricted by measures such as leverage caps, the Australian regulatory landscape is much less harsh. Today, ASIC has voiced its concerns that some Australian financial service (AFS) licensees may be taking advantage of the latest regulatory developments and are abusing the scope of their AFS licenses.
AFS licensees are warned that in addition to overseas consequences of potential breaches of overseas law, ASIC will consider whether breaching overseas law is consistent with obligations under Australian law to provide services ‘efficiently, honestly and fairly’. ASIC will also consider whether AFS licensee are making misleading or deceptive statements about the scope or application or effect of an AFS licence.
In particular, Chinese authorities have informed ASIC that: ‘some online platforms are illegally engaged in forex margin trading activities.’
Legal provisions have been implemented in China providing that ‘any unauthorized institution that conducts forex margin trading without approval [in China] shall be deemed to be in violation of the law. It is also illegal for any client (entity or individual) to entrust an unauthorized institution to conduct forex margin trading.’
AFS licensees with China-based clients may be conducting unlicensed or illegal activities in China if they are providing margin foreign exchange products to retail clients in China.
Temporary product intervention measures have recently been extended in Europe by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Authorities in the United Kingdom and Germany have announced permanent measures.
ASIC is concerned that some OTC derivative issuers that hold AFS licenses (or their agents) may be marketing or soliciting clients located in China, Europe and other jurisdictions to open accounts with Australian-based AFS licensees on the basis doing so will avoid the overseas intervention measures.
Commissioner Armour said: ‘AFS licensees who break the law in overseas jurisdictions, or who mislead retail investors about their services undermine the integrity of the Australian licensing regime. ASIC will not tolerate that conduct.’

McLarenâs âagingâ wind tunnel â used for the last decade in a partnership with Toyota in Cologne, Germany â will soon be replaced by a bespoke facility in McLarenâs Woking headquarters. Technical Director James Key explained why McLaren are taking the step to build a new facility, and why itâs more important now than ever to have their own.
If they cement their fourth-place standing, this will be McLaren's highest constructorsâ championship finish since 2012. But to build on that and replicate their championship-contending years â think 2008, 2010, or most notably 2005 when McLaren lost out on the constructorsâ title to Renault in the final race â they need to upgrade their own tools.
Key, who joined the team this season from Toro Rosso, explained that a wind tunnel is a âlittle secretâ that helps teams extract the most from their design. As a result, a new wind tunnel was at the top of his and recently appointed Team Principal Andreas Seidlâs list.
âIt was very important, explained Key. "I think when Andreas and I joined, it was one of the big projects, which was kind of on the table but needed to be rationalised and discussed, and thatâs exactly what we didâ¦

American ride-sharing company Uber Technologies will be letting go 8% or more than 400 staff from its product and engineering teams as it attempts its rough ride to profitability.
A spokesman told news agency AFP on Tuesday the firm is cutting about 265 people from its engineering group and another 170 more jobs from its product team.
The firm which was founded in 2009, currently has more than 27,000 employees around the world. The decision to cut jobs was to improve on efficiency, Uber said.
‘Our hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day to day - ruthlessly prioritising, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility,’ the Uber spokesperson said.
Uber slashed 400 staff from its marketing team in July to reduce costs and also to improve on efficiency, the firm had said.
The tech company made losses that were below market expectations in the second quarter. It lost US$5.2 billion as compared to losing US$848 million in the same period last year. Revenue, meanwhile, grew 14% to US$3.2 billion.
Due to investors’ concerns on the firm's ability to deliver profits, Uber’s shares have fallen since its debut price of US$45 in May. On Monday, Uber's shares closed the day's session at US$33.51.

The pan-EU watchdog issues positive opinions on the national product intervention measures proposed by the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovakia.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) continues to issue positive opinions about the planned restrictions on the offering of CFDs and binaries by the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of European countries. The latest countries to receive positive assessment by ESMA are the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovakia.
ESMA has issued opinions on national product intervention measures from:
The Česká Národní Banka of the Czech Republic (CNB)– Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options;
The Finantsinspektsioon of Estonia (FSA) – Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options;

The Národná Banka Slovenska (NBS)- Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options; and
The Národná Banka Slovenska (NBS) – Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences.
ESMA’s opinion finds that the proposed measures are justified and proportionate. This is barely surprising as the proposed national measures are the same as those implemented by ESMA last summer. The difference is that the national measures are set to be implemented on a permanent basis.
This means that binary options marketing and offering to retail investors will be prohibited, whereas the offering of CFDs to such investors will be restricted (via measures like leverage caps).
A number of other countries have secured ESMA’s positive evaluation regarding their product intervention measures. The list includes Finland, Lithuania, Spain, Austria, Poland, the UK and the Netherlands.
It would be interesting to see how ESMA would react to the Cypriot proposals. Let’s recall that, CySEC has unveiled a proposal for national product intervention measures that envisage different leverage caps depending on the types of retail investors.

The changes in relation to rules covering binary options and CFDs reflect the assumption that UK firms will lose passporting rights after exit day.
The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has earlier today published its latest Quarterly Consultation Paper which outlines a set of proposed amendments to the Handbook. Some of the proposed changes are related to the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, as the UK regulator has to fix deficiencies in any affected Handbook provisions.
The list of proposed changes in this Consultation Paper concerns, inter alia, Conduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS) 22.4 and 22.5. That is, the rules that ban the offering of binary options in the UK and that impose restrictions on the retail marketing, distribution and sale of contracts for differences (CFDs) and similar speculative investments.
In particular, the proposals represent consequential changes in relation to binary options and CFDs to reflect the assumption that UK firms will lose passporting rights after exit day. Additionally, the rules will not apply to EEA firms unless they have temporary permission, are in the financial services contracts regime as a supervised run-off firm or are a contractual run-off firm.
This means that the rules will not apply to EEA firms which are operating in the UK outside of those regimes. For instance, the rules will not apply to an EEA firm operating in the UK through the Overseas Persons Exclusion.
As a result of the changes, EEA firms operating outside the temporary regimes will be treated in the same way as third country firms.
The rules will automatically apply to temporary permission firms, supervised run-off firms and contractual run-off firms.
Let’s recall that, in July this year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published its opinion with regard to the product intervention measures proposed by the FCA. ESMA said the national measures outlined by the FCA are justified and proportionate except for:

Finis les essais et maquettes. La CFD (pour computational fluid dynamics ou mécanique des fluides numériques) a remplacé la recherche en bassin d’essai de carènes lors de la dernière édition de l’America’s Cup, temple de la navigation sportive high-tech. Les règles de jauge ont imposé cette méthode qui consiste à étudier les mouvements d'un fluide, ou leurs effets, par la résolution numérique des équations régissant ce fluide. Objectif : économiser du temps et de l’argent.
Pour Numeca, spécialisé dans les logiciels de CFD, l’aventure America’s Cup a commencé en 2013, avec l’arrivée des AC72, des catamarans surpuissants à foils et aile rigide. L’entreprise, basée à Bruxelles et qui compte environ 150 salariés à travers le monde, a alors été sollicitée par Emirates Team New Zealand. « La CFD permet de tester des centaines, voire des milliers de configurations. On ne pouvait pas construire autant de prototypes, cela aurait été infaisable. La CFD est presque une boîte noire. On appuie sur un bouton et ça vous donne un résultat pour 1000 variations pour le bateau : vitesse, position, chargement… », explique Benoit Mallol, responsable des applications navales chez Numeca. Cette première expérience sur la Coupe de l’America « nous a demandé un énorme degré d’automatisation. Cela nous a permis de tester la robustesse du code. On n’avait pas le droit à l’erreur. Il a fallu que les guides de bonnes pratiques soient corrects et bien délimités. On a ainsi pu franchir un cap ».
De l’aéronautique au maritime
Loin du monde de la régate, Numeca a vu le jour il y a plus d’un quart de siècle, en Belgique. Fondé par le professeur Charles Hirsch, responsable du département de mécanique des fluides à l’Université Libre de Bruxelles, Numeca s’est d’abord penché sur les machines tournantes, comme les réacteurs d’avion ou les compresseurs des moteurs de voiture. Le professeur Hirsch « a commencé par écrire des codes de calcul pour simuler des machines tournantes via un ordinateur plutôt que d’avoir à les fabriquer à chaque fois pour les essayer », résume Benoit Mallol. Les logiciels de CFD permettent de modéliser un objet et de représenter l’écoulement des fluides (air, eau, gaz, liquides…) à l’intérieur ou autour de cet objet. Pour une voiture, par exemple, il est possible de simuler la trainée aérodynamique et ainsi optimiser le design de la voiture et améliorer son moteur.

L’entreprise s’est ensuite tournée, il y a 12 ans, vers le maritime. La CFD offre la possibilité d’observer dans des conditions variées, aussi bien les frottements du bateau dans l’eau et l’air, que la ventilation, l’importance de la pollution liée à une cheminée, ou encore de déterminer si la propulsion est adéquate. Pour développer un outil dédié à l’environnement maritime, Numeca a profité d’un partenariat avec l’École centrale de Nantes. Le travail pour concevoir la chaîne de simulation a été divisé. Numeca a apporté un « mailleur », pour « découper l’espace autour du bateau », décrit Benoit Mallol. Ensuite, il s’agit de résoudre des « équations dans chaque partie de ces espaces ». C’est là que Centrale Nantes intervient : « Ils avaient un solveur, c’est-à-dire un code qui résout des équations. Il s’est avéré que nos deux codes étaient très compatibles. L’un avait un mailleur, l’autre un solveur, on s’est dit qu’on allait travailler ensemble ».
Restait à développer l’interface avant de commercialiser le logiciel pour les architectes navals et ingénieurs marine. « Notre logiciel est facile à prendre en main », estime le responsable de Numeca. « Ce n’est pas un logiciel tous azimuts ou très généraliste qui permet de tout faire. Ensuite, tout le vocabulaire utilisé dans le logiciel et dans la documentation est dédié au marin. On a une vingtaine de personnes qui ne jurent que par le bateau, donc on parle le même langage ». Au final, il peut aussi bien être utilisé par des petits cabinets d’architectes que de grands chantiers de construction. Numeca compte compte parmi ses clients IXblue, CMN, A2V, LMG Marin, ShipST…
Résistances
La simulation numérique a-t-elle pour autant remplacé les éprouvés bassins d’essais de carènes ? « Tous les grands chantiers utilisent de la CFD de façon directe ou indirecte », répond Benoit Mallol. Une évolution logique, pour lui : « Je ne crois pas qu’il y ait de limite par rapport aux bassins d’essais classiques, je suis assez convaincu qu’on est capable de tout simuler au niveau de l’hydrodynamique navale ». D’autant, souligne-t-il, que les essais en bassins nécessitent la construction d’une maquette introduisant des incertitudes et que chaque modification du design prend du temps et des matériaux pour être testée. Sans compter les problèmes d’effets d’échelle. Or, « avec la CFD, pas de problèmes de dimensionnalité ».
(© : NUMECA)
S’il estime le marché de la CFD « mature », il concède qu’il rencontre néanmoins des résistances. « Traditionnellement, dans les mentalités, on teste et c’est mieux, on ne fait pas confiance à un ordinateur, car on estime que ça a des bugs. On préfère les bassins, pourtant, l’humain fait aussi des erreurs et est moins rapide. Je crois que les gens aiment voir de leurs propres yeux ce qu’il se passe sur une maquette, même si ça ne correspond pas exactement à la réalité ». Mais il constate des évolutions. « On est en train de repousser le moment où on va utiliser le bassin. Pour la phase de pré-design, quand on regarde dans quelle direction aller, les bassins sont déjà hors question. On va immédiatement tester l’idée en CFD. Désormais, le bassin sert à valider ce que la CFD a réussi à démontrer en phase de design. On ne va pas changer les mentalités du jour au lendemain. Mais elles ont déjà beaucoup évolué, car pour rester compétitif, il faut être innovant ».
Reste cependant des progrès à faire pour la simulation numérique, notamment pour accélérer le calcul dans des situations très instationnaires, comme une mer désordonnée, par exemple. L’entreprise planche également sur le jumeau digital : « A bord, on peut faire une simulation et interroger ses bases de données pour savoir comment le bateau va se comporter par rapport au changement de météo, au chargement, à la vitesse ». Là encore, les champs d’application sont vastes : économie de carburant, amélioration du comportement du navire pour le confort des passagers, diminution des risques…

The Motor Sports Unit Development Division (MSUDD) of Toyota Motor Corporation has been using Siemens PLM STAR-CD and STAR-CCM+ software to develop a variety of race vehicles in top motorsport categories.
One of the roles of the MSUDD is to develop vehicles for the FIA World Endurance Championship. It also conducts R&D on engines and cars for Japanese race series such as the Super Formula and Super GT series.

MSUDD has three principles to guide its approach to developing cars that are fast: to accelerate the development of advanced automotive technologies through participation in racing; to attract new race fans by demonstrating enthusiasm to attack challenges in difficult and unknown technologies; and to broaden the range of car enthusiasts by organizing events where people can experience the excitement of driving cars.
The CAE/CFD team within the MSUDD is a group comprising around 15 people. With the limited time and resources available, competing in the world of racing requires a technological standardization that enables the team to prioritize analysis work, coordinate postprocessing schedules, and ensure that the analytical results are consistent and repeatable.
In the world of race cars, developments for the next year, preparations for the next race, and work to accommodate frequently changing regulations are all extremely important. CFD can thus make an important contribution by enabling the team to reduce turnaround time.
“Race cars are not like production vehicles that mature over a span of several years,”
said MSUDD manager Yuichiro Kato. “Even if the external shape of the most recently designed race car looks identical to the car from the previous year, its internal components are likely to be entirely different.
“The team is essentially developing a completely new car every year. With such a quick turnaround, the reliability and performance of elements, including the external aerodynamic shape and engine, must be ensured before the car is ever built.
“The conventional approach has been to undergo a repetitive process of prototype building and testing, but now we are able to conduct thorough analytical assessments before even a single part has been made.”
The aerodynamic designs of Le Mans cars are developed jointly with Toyota Motorsport, which is located in Germany. During Toyota’s participation in Formula 1 racing, wind tunnels were central to development efforts, and CFD played a supplemental role. Today, however, CFD is critical to concept testing, and plays an important role in visualizing flow and deciding on vehicle design concepts.
CFD plays a key part not only in reducing development turnaround time, but in recent years, in the actual parts development process as well. “Since there is no time to put a real car in a wind tunnel to make adjustments between races, and because opportunities for track testing are limited, a process is emerging for quickly moving design elements from CFD to actual vehicles, increasing the importance of the CFD output,” explained Teppei Hojo, MSUDD manager.
“There is a growing need to make decisions based on initial tests. So the car performance from the very first test determines the competitiveness of a vehicle during the season.”
Of particular importance today are technologies that enable engineers to improve vehicle and component performance in the design and development phase before any manufacturing is done. Using CAE/CFD technologies such as STAR-CCM+ is making this possible considering the industry’s highly demanding development schedules and processes.

Chinese resident clients contracted to IG’s Australian entity generated revenue of £2.7 million in FY19.
Online trading major IG Group Holdings plc (LON:IGG) has earlier today posted its preliminary results for the year to May 31, 2019, with the report including an update on regulatory developments.
These developments concern, inter alia, IG’s Australian operations.
The Group explains that, in April 2019 following a request from the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) asked all its licensed providers of CFDs to prevent Chinese nationals from trading through their platforms. IG ceased accepting new trades from Chinese resident clients in June 2019 and all accounts of Chinese resident clients in Australia will be closed by the end of July 2019.
Chinese resident clients contracted to IG’s Australian entity generated revenue of £2.7 million in FY19.
The Australian regulator is also expected to open a consultation process regarding potential measures they may seek to apply to the CFD industry. The Group expects that any measures ASIC chooses to implement, which are expected to include leverage restrictions, will apply to Retail clients only and will exclude clients who elect to be categorised as a Wholesale client.
Let’s note that IG is not the single brokerage whose work with Chinese clients has changed over the past couple of months. Hong Kong-focused retail Forex broker KVB Kunlun Financial Group Ltd (HKG:6877), said in May that it had received a letter from ASIC dated April 18, 2019 addressed to its licensees. The Letter reminded licensees that they were obliged to comply with applicable laws of foreign jurisdictions, and recommended that licensees should seek legal advice to ensure that the products and services they offer to their clients comply with applicable foreign laws.
Given ASIC’s Letter, the board of directors of KVB Kunlun has sought legal advice from its lawyer as to the laws of the People’s Republic of China. In line with the advice from the legal advisers on the PRC laws, a detailed survey of the Group’s Existing Ethnic Chinese Clients will be conducted. This survey aims to identify anyone who is, or who may possible be, classified as a PRC domestic client. Any person identified as an actual or potential PRC domestic client will then be disengaged as soon as possible.

ESMA has agreed to renew the restrictions on the marketing, distribution or sale of CFDs to retail clients from May 1, 2019 for a further three-month period.
In an anticipated move, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) says today it has agreed to once again renew the restrictions on the marketing, distribution or sale of contracts for differences (CFDs) to retail clients. The measures will be renewed from May 1, 2019 for a further three-month period.
Regarding the rationale for the extension, ESMA explains that it considers that a significant investor protection concern related to the offer of CFDs to retail clients continues to exist.
The measures will be renewed on the same terms as the previous renewal decision that started to apply on February 1, 2019.
This means that there will be leverage limits on the opening of a position by a retail client from 30:1 to 2:1, depending on the volatility of the underlying. Thus, the leverage cap is 30x for major currency pairs and 2x for cryptocurrencies.
The restrictions also include a margin close out rule on a per account basis. This standardises the percentage of margin (at 50% of minimum required margin) at which providers are required to close out one or more retail client’s open CFDs. In addition, there has to be negative balance protection on a per account basis, as well as a restriction on the incentives offered to trade CFDs. Finally, CFD brokerages have to provide a standardised risk warning, including the percentage of losses on a CFD provider’s retail investor accounts.
In the meantime, several EU countries have acted to implement investor protection measures similar to those advanced by ESMA. The latest example is France. Earlier this week, France’s financial markets authority AMF announced the opening of Consultation regarding measures restricting the offering of CFDs and banning the offer of binary options to non-professional investors at a national level.
The idea behind the proposals is to have rules for investor protection, analogical to those introduced by ESMA. These rules are set to work at a national level. Broadly speaking, the restrictions proposed by the French regulator are identical to those outlined by ESMA. The list includes negative balance protection and leverage restrictions for CFDs, for instance.

Reduced client trading activity following the implementation of the ESMA intervention measures is among the factors weighing on revenues.
Online trading services provider CMC Markets Plc (LON:CMCX) has earlier today provided a trading update for the financial year to March 31, 2019 (FY 2019).
The company says that overall performance during the period has been affected by reduced client trading activity following the implementation of the ESMA restrictions on the offering of CFDs to retail clients. This was compounded by challenging market conditions during much of the final quarter.
As a result, CMC expects to report CFD and spread-bet revenue of c. £110 million for FY 2019, 37% lower than the prior year, and net operating income of c. £131 million.
The impact of the new ESMA margin rules, which has resulted in retail clients trading less, utilising more of their cash to fund their margin requirements or needing to deposit more funds with CMC to trade at previous levels, is showing signs of stabilising. Since the introduction of the new rules, client money has remained strong, and active client and new client numbers have remained stable resulting in the Group having confidence in meeting the consensus FY 2020 outlook.
CMC also noted its enlarged stockbroking business in Australia, which migrated approximately 500,000 stockbroking client accounts as part of an ANZ Bank white label transaction at the end of H1. This, and the continued strength of CMC’s institutional business also provide confidence in the Group’s outlook.
Let’s recall that, during the first half of FY19, CMC Markets registered a statutory profit before tax of £7.2 million, down 76% on prior year (H1 2018: £29.8 million). Profit after tax was £7.8 million, down 69% against the equivalent period a year earlier (H1 2018: £25 million). Basic earnings per share were 2.7 pence in H1 2019 (H1 2018: 8.7 pence).
During the six months to September 30, 2018, operating expenses rose 6% to £62.7 million (H1 2018: £59.3 million), mainly due to investment in the stockbroking business and higher fixed salary costs across the Group. Revenue per active client fell 22% year-on-year to £1,413.

Certain transactions will have to be reported to derivative trade repositories using a ‘life cycle’ method, rather than an end-of-day ‘snapshot’ method.
The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) has earlier today posted its latest Market Integrity Report which covers highlights of the work of the regulator in the second half of 2018. Importantly, the document includes some reminders about recently introduced rules and future regulations.
Thus, ASIC reminds firms about changes to reporting for several derivatives products. The regulator is implementing its proposed changes to the way transactions in contracts for difference (CFDs), margin FX and equity over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives must be reported. The changes will provide better reporting to help the regulator monitor market misconduct.
The changes involved making an excluded derivative determination, requiring these types of transactions to be reported to derivative trade repositories using a ‘life cycle’ method, rather than an end-of-day ‘snapshot’ method.
Following consideration of feedback received on the proposal, an excluded derivative determination under subrule 2.2.8(3) of the ASIC Derivatives Transaction Rules (Reporting) 2013, covering CFDs, margin FX and equity OTC derivatives was made on November 30, 2018. effective from July 1, 2019.
In addition, the regulator stresses the importance of the entity identifier requirement under OTC derivative transactions reporting rules.
From April 1, 2019, financial entities that are required to report trades in OTC derivative transactions under the ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Reporting) 2013 must report a standard identifier for any company or other entity (excluding individuals) that is a counterparty to a transaction in an OTC derivative, including CFDs and margin FX.
The standard identifiers to meet this requirement are:
› Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)
› if no LEI or interim entity identifier is available for the entity, an international business entity identifier issued by Avox Limited (AVID)
› if no AVID is available, a Business Identifier Code (BIC).
A conditional short-term extension of relief has been granted.

Norson Design is a full-service boat design operation that provides everything from clean-sheet design, prototyping, proofs of concept and testing to full-series production. The company, based in France, has significant experience in all marine sectors, and continually pushes the envelope to bring innovative designs to market.
When it came to designing a new high-speed boat, engineers at Norson Design wanted to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to test the complex boundaries between boat, water and air. However, they found that CFD was rarely used in the marine sector, especially when it came to the design of high-speed watercraft.
The engineering team at Norson Design not only needed to create new CFD code, they also needed access to high performance computing (HPC) systems of the caliber used to design of planes, trains and automobiles. They found this HPC power via a collaboration with Supercomputing Wales and a team of researchers at Swansea University.
A design process enabled by HPC
For this high-tech design process, Norson Design provided CAD models, geometry and shape. The team at Swansea University, in turn, wrote software for modeling and simulation. They then built a wind tunnel and a tank to test and measure the forces and loads. They could then adjust different elements in the boat equasion and see and track the results of each design modification.
For this type of high-powered research, supercomputing resources are essential. The more HPC resources, the faster and more accurate the answers you can get. Researchers can take into account physical properties at an extreme level — such as measuring the phenomena of air and water at a particle level. In the simulation process, the complex behaviors of spray and turbulence need to be accounted for, as well as the interaction surface between boats, air and water.
To address these challenges, the team at Swansea University applied methods used widely in aerodynamics to optimize the design of speedboats. With Supercomputing Wales HPC, they then used state-of-the-art shape optimization and artificial intelligence techniqes to generate aero and hydrodynamic profiles for high-speed vessels. With these models capturing the interactions, the team was able to generate high-resolution details of the flow under the hull, which they correlated against models and full-size boats.
Working in software, the research team made a series of modifications to the design and tested it to determine the impact to speed and stability. This iterative process is resource-intensive, yet it’s still far more cost effective than building and crashing physical prototypes on the water.
“A typical simulation uses 450 compute cores running for 72 hours to get about 0.5 seconds of physically simulated time. It would take years on a desktop,” says Dr. Ed Bennett, a Supercomputing Wales research software engineer based at Swansea University. “With supercomputing resources, it’s exciting to see advances in the marine industry. We are working on radical boat designs based on hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, carefully optimizing the hull to help create the world’s fastest boat, and we’re very excited to see how it’s going to turn out.”1
The HPC engine under the hood
This high-powered research initiative is leveraging the resources of a Dell EMC and Atos Supercomputing Centre of Excellence with Supercomputing Wales, which provides researchers with a full suite of leading-edge HPC equipment, software and services. The Centre provides two Dell EMC supercomputers comprised of PowerEdge servers, PowerSwitch networking and PowerVault storage, along with Atos extreme factory, HPC-as-a-Service.
Part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund through the Welsh Government, Supercomputing Wales is led by Cardiff University in a consortium with Swansea, Bangor and Aberystwyth universities. The program’s two supercomputer hubs are based at Cardiff and Swansea universities, with research teams across the consortium accessing the facilities. These hubs contain more than 13,000 cores, tens of terabytes of memory and hundreds of terabytes of high-performance storage interconnected with low-latency/high-bandwidth networking.
The results
HPC-driven research can truly change the lives of people, both on and off the water. For example, this research can lead to the creation of super-fast rescue vessels and lifeboats that save the lives of people who are in peril at sea. It can also drive advances in boat designs for defense, security and racing.
Here’s a case in point. Collaboration between Norson Design and boat builder Ophardt Maritim has resulted in a new range of customized, multi-sized high-performance rigid-inflatable boats (RIBs) — a type of boat with a rigid hull and inflatable tubes around its outer edges. Some of these aluminum boats — ranging from seven meters to 12 meters — are capable of moving at speeds in excess of 70 knots, while maintaining good stability, cornering, riding comfort and overall seakeeping performance.2
Even better, the Ophardt Maritim’s RIBs were designed to be produced with the high-precision robotic welding technology used in Ophardt’s automated systems for aluminum-hull production. These systems yield boats with extremely smooth hulls that are ready to skim across the water with precise handling at very high speeds. For a look at the boats and the production systems that bring them to life, watch the video “Boatbuilding 4.0: Passion for Precision.”
The big picture
Supercomputing systems and HPC-driven simulations are one of the new keys to building faster, safer and more efficient boats in less time — without building and destroying physical prototypes. With the power of HPC systems, boat designers and builders can more easily consider the effects of hydrodynamics, aerodynamics and other complex phenomena in the design process.
This isn’t the future. This is happening today — and that’s a point underscored by the groundbreaking work being done by researchers at Swansea University and Supercomputing Wales, working closely with their counterparts at Norson Design.

Australian risk consultant and founder of professional trading software company ManagedLeverage Richard Goers gives a gritty account of how he sees ASIC’s draconian proposals and the polarised reaction of brokerages
By Richard Goers, Founder & Managing Director, ManagedLeverage and risk consultant with over 25 years expertise
As a long-termer in the Australian FX business, it would be interesting to review how the Europeans fought the EMSA on their product intervention proposals.
Ever since the recent proposals were placed into the hands of the public and the Australian CFD providers by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), there has been a massive rallying of the troops here as important decisions are beginning to be made by brokerages.
The strategies and the outcome, as in the Antipodes, when you would have thought by now that most people have had the time to rethink these strategies for this event, but then, maybe it is not so smart to assume that many people would know what was likely to be proposed by ASIC.
We knew that there may well be an attempt to follow the ESMA rulings, but that is limited just to leverage, I’m not sure that anyone had guessed or could have anticipated that they would consider restricting leverage whilst at the same time making an emulation of the rulings in the United States by preventing retail margin brokers from attracting international clients.
Some of the larger companies are going ALL OUT on a campaign to get both retail traders and the ‘industry’ to respond to ASIC’s toxic product intervention with feedback to the regulator on why ‘leverage’ is good, which in regulator-speak equates in the minds of the bureaucrats to ‘greed is good’ and therefore perhaps they would like to get Michael Douglas to reword that scene in Wall Street.
Some individuals with a vested interest in ensuring that the right outcome for the industry is reached and sustainability can be reasonably assured are using LinkedIn popups with talking heads, industry forums, industry submissions. I am not sure about FaceBook as I dont go there but that is also a retail FX outlet via its pages and forums.
I think the current strategy is one dimensional in that leverage is good, retail needs leverage, and an overreaching perspective that if leverage is reduced the industry will collapse and create unemployment, think of all the tax being paid. This can be conveyed to the government via media presenting pretty faces who make money trading FX.
Then you have SaxoBank down here calling out this practice and fully supporting low leverage as well as headlining in the media, therefore it seems that the division is to accept the fate, or fight it, and many firms may plump for option B if not already in place, as wall paperers, get the great unwashed out to the islands, they need the fresh air to trade as they wish.
CMC Markets and IG Group seem agnostic, if that is the right word,relaxed as to their fate or smart enough to play the long tail game.
Leverage restrictions in conjunction with restricted access to offshore clients is the killer to the business, and some of the good quality retail brokers in Australia are highlighting this fact.
The dog whistle here is that the industry feels that it has a right to exist, that if the retail customer wants and needs to get the daily dose of leverage it is their money, they are not breaking any rules, therefore let them have it.
Bearing this in mind, my suggestion is that ASIC is thinking CFDs are like cigarettes: They need to be restricted as a health hazard and industry self regulation is not working, take them off the shelf, debrand them.
There is a whole lot of research into how some of the industry players (some of course of which do not exist today, yet have done damage!) knew the risks but hid them, using similar arguments that today’s thoughts show, and used marketing and lobby groups to maintain the status quo.
As per my analogy, people can still get cigarettes, but consumption has fallen. God forbid that is a bad thing and the tobacco industry is still very profitable.
I would have thought and still think it is an option that will be presented, that there be a third category. Not retail and just wholesale [who are retail with more money] but an experienced trader between these definitions who opts for leverage, the European option.
However, at its core, some of the B-book firms are showing that their business can only exist on client losses – that their business model exists because clients lose and therefore move into offshore clients in order to survive.
It highlights that anyone who seeks to rescind their ASIC license and head offshore are not legit financial institutions to offer investment products but bucket shops of the early 20th Century when Livermore was around.
To be frank, the industry does not have a lot to play with and seems to run on the idea that ASIC still plays to the old rules that they only intervene when there is a breach, when the patient is hit by a car, they are the ambulance which usually arrives too late.
20:1 leverage requires $5,000 to trade $100,000. You get a margin call at 50%, which is $2,500 which needs to be ponied up to trade again.
Therefore, the outcome is that traders who put down $100 which is leveraged to $1,000 are gone or now can only trade minis.
As per the Japanese example, trading becomes more disciplined, safer for the trader, an option as a side hussle to make money in a zero interest rate environment coming to the rest of the world. It seems the landscape is suitable for low leverage derivatives to become a viable option to trade at 20 – 30 to 1 leverage which is where the professionals trade.
So what will we see perhaps is more marketing on mini lots, and in terms of new product, a lot of noise to make traders increase turnover, perhaps some commentary from talking heads called market information, beefed up economic calendars, maybe Twitter feeds, all to get as much information to the trader to get them to trade more.
The old adage that old school traders had which was to turn off CNBC [at least the Taleb style traders] as there was no intelligence there but entertainment, now this applies for retail traders in the case of their smart phone.
As lower leverage increases the duration of the trade, the velocity of earnings slows down, and so less there is realised loss, and more unrealised exposure for the broker which is a dangerous space as the client can actually make money which the B bookers think is the pure definition of a toxic trader.
Thus, there could be some new products on the horizon to increase turnover to balance out the equation that leverage impacts, get the trader to trade more but, as many people in the industry well know, will not stop clients making losses on their trades.
Now for something completely different. Perhaps we should look at MetaTrader as a legacy system. After all, MT4 sounds almost the same as saying Model T Ford.

Correlation, in basic terms, is trying to match the data that you measure off the car against your simulator data.
If they do match, then you know that your development, or simulation environment, is good, and you can use that to develop the car. Everything correlates well and you know that you can trust your simulation environment, which is much cheaper and much more efficient in terms of developing a car. You know that something that has given you a gain in your simulation and development environment is going to give you a gain on the real car.
SMEDLEY: What teams do on the first day of F1 Pre-Season Testing
Where teams have problems is when their development or simulation environment â so CFD [Computational Fluid Dynamics] or wind tunnel â doesnât describe well what happens in reality (although in truth, no-oneâs wind tunnel correlates absolutely 100%). At that point, youâve got a problem and youâve got to try and understand where the mismatch is coming from.

The first 400MW phase of the offshore wind farm starts receiving payments
The initial phase of Orsted’s 1200MW Hornsea 1 offshore wind farm has met an operational milestone under the terms of the Contract for Difference awarded to it.
Around 400MW of the wind farm's capacity has passed the tests required for the Low Carbon Contracts Company’s (LCCC) operational conditions precedent, including a confirmed start date of 2 May and is now receiving CfD payments.
LCCC is the designated counterparty for CfD for contracts awarded to generators under the government’s CfD scheme.
In its role as counterparty, LCCC is governed by its guiding principle to “maintain investor confidence in the CfD scheme and minimise costs to consumers”, contributing to the government’s objectives of ensuring the UK has reliable, affordable and clean electricity.
Hornsea 1 is being developed in the North Sea off the coast of Yorkshire, 120km off the UK’s east coast.
The wind farm will be fully operational in 2020.
Earlier this month Orsted hit the halfway point of the turbine installation campaign for the project, installing and commissioning around 87 of the project's 174 Siemens Gamesa turbines.
Fred Olsen Windcarrier jack-up Bold Tern and DEME Offshore Sea Challenger vessel will continue to install hardware from the project's turbine marshalling port at Alexandra Dock in Hull.
LCCC manages a portfolio of Contracts for Difference (CfDs) with low carbon generators, collectively building over 13GW of new capacity.

More than 80% of OTC retail derivatives clients reside offshore, including in high risk AML countries and countries which have restricted the sale of these products.
The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) continues to respond to a high incidence of misconduct in the retail OTC derivatives sector and to see large sums of client losses. This was made clear by Commissioner Cathie Armour who delivered a speech at the ACI Redefining Conduct in FX Markets Seminar held in Sydney on August 14, 2019.
The products offered by retail OTC derivatives issuers in Australia include Forex products as well as binary options and other contracts for difference.
Last year, ASIC published results of a review that found high rates of client losses in retail OTC derivatives trades, with the percentage of unprofitable clients being up to 80% for binary options, 72% for CFD traders and 63% for margin FX traders.
The regulator keeps responding to high levels of misconduct in the sector and to see heavy client losses. The complaints ASIC and the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) have received from clients has grown significantly over the past year, Commissioner Armour noted.
In April 2019, ASIC conducted a review of the licensed entities active in retail OTC derivatives. The regulator found that the number of retail clients trading OTC derivatives has doubled in the past two years.
In summary:
Over 60 CFD and binary options issuers are licensed in Australia.
The retail OTC derivatives market has an annual turnover of $21 trillion and over 1 million investors, 99% of which are retail clients.
Of the 675 million transactions in the 2018 calendar year, 426 million of these were in FX products – that’s over 60%. In ASIC’s previous review, there were 165 million transactions in FX products. So there has been a steep growth in these FX products, and this growth has been much faster than the growth in the number of other CFD or binary option transactions over the same period.
Despite this high number of FX product transactions, margin FX represents around 32% in terms of net revenue, behind CFDs at 39%.
Further, over 80% of OTC retail derivatives clients reside offshore, including in high risk AML countries and countries which have restricted the sale of these products.
Licensed issuers hold over $2.9 billion on behalf of clients, an increase of 45% from the previous review.
Many margin FX issuers offer leverage of 400:1 and higher, the Commissioner said. She did not specify, however, the precise number of such entities.
ASIC will continue to review the data it has gathered and will address the key themes and concerns that arise from the review. Where the regulator sees that products or practices in this sector have resulted in, or are likely to result in, significant consumer harm then the regulator will address this harm using the full range of power available to it.
Commissioner Armour also mentioned the recent ASIC warning to brokerages about certain overseas activities. Regulators in many jurisdictions, such as in China, Europe, New Zealand, Israel, Japan and North America have restricted or prohibited the provision to retail investors of certain OTC derivatives.
ASIC has publicly warned Australian issuers that they may be dealing with offshore investors illegally and to cease any non-compliant activities. There may be consequences overseas for potential breaches of overseas law, but in any event, ASIC will consider whether breaching overseas law is consistent with obligations under Australian law to provide services efficiently, honestly and fairly.

CySEC is proposing to prohibit the marketing, distribution and sale of leveraged CFDs on crypto assets to retail clients, unless they fall within the upper tier of the positive target market.
The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) has earlier today published its proposals for national measures that reflect the product intervention measures introduced by ESMA about a year ago. Such a move has been largely expected as other national competent authorities (NCAs) in the EEA have already taken similar steps.
But CySEC’s announcement provides a surprising twist, as the Cypriot regulator wants to vary leverage caps for CFD trading depending on the type of retail investors. Put otherwise, some retail investors will see even harsher leverage restrictions than the ones introduced by ESMA, whereas others may see the restrictions relaxed.
According to CySEC, the ESMA Decision on CFDs does not distinguish between different subcategories of retails clients. MiFID II does not distinguish between different subcategories of retail clients either, but introduced the notion of target market. CySEC expects CFD providers will not sell such products to clients falling within the negative target market. However, CySEC cannot rule out the possibility that sales of such products might appear in the case of retail clients falling within the grey area of target market (i.e. those not falling neither within the positive target market nor within the negative target market).
CySEC also acknowledges that the term “retail client” encompasses different types of investors, with different levels of knowledge and financial position and the persons falling within the positive target market does not necessarily share the same level of knowledge and financial position.
The Cypriot regulator explains that, in determining the suitability of CFD products during the customer due diligence process, each retail client must be categorised by the firm within a specific target market – either ‘positive’ or ‘negative.’ Retail clients who fall in the ‘grey’ area of target market (fit neither within the positive target market nor within the negative target market) could be vulnerable to being offered leverage that exceeds their knowledge, financial position and risk appetite.
Accordingly, CySEC is proposing to introduce stricter leverage limits for retail clients falling within the ‘grey area’ of the target market, and affording slightly higher leverage limits for retail clients falling within the upper tier of the positive target market.
CySEC is proposing to prohibit the marketing, distribution and sale of leveraged CFDs on crypto assets to retail clients, unless they fall within the upper tier of the positive target market to prevent exposure to excessive risk caused by the extreme volatility of the instrument.
Finally, CySEC plans to adopt permanent National Product Intervention Measures on Binary Options, which will be the same as ESMA’s measures, without any pubic consultation on the subject matter. An official statement will be issued once the measures are formally adopted.
Interested parties may submit their comments to the CySEC Policy Department by email at policy@cysec.gov.cy .
The submission of comments should be made no later than 14 June 2019 . The subject of the email should have the following form:

Formula 1 is no longer about brute horsepower and the smell of gasoline. Since its '80s and '90s heydays, F1 has transformed into a greener, safer and more technologically advanced sport. Cars are now powered by the most efficient and complex hybrid gasoline/electric motors in the world.
The power is still brutal, but it's clean. The 1.6-liter turbocharged engines generate 800 horsepower. Charged by regenerative braking and redundant turbo energy, batteries tap an additional 160 horsepower for 33 seconds per lap. With all that engaged, the cars can hit 230 mph on the straights. At the same time, they have the world's most efficient gasoline vehicle engines, too.
Along with the green emphasis, F1 is safer than it's ever been. Where fatal accidents seemed to happen almost every year in the '70s and '80s, there has only been one death in the last 25 years. The sport's body and most supporters would never turn the clock back to those ugly times. What real fans do want is more sport to this sport.
To achieve that, teams and fans endure endless rules covering everything from development to racing. For instance, Ferrari's Sebastien Vettel was judged to have re-entered the track dangerously near the end of the recent Canadian Grand Prix. The subsequent five-second violation, added after the race ended, handed the victory to Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and aggravated many fans of the sport.
The rules and complexity of F1 are putting off fans, but it's the costs that are especially challenging for a mid-tier team like Renault. At the French Grand Prix at Castellet, I spoke with team leaders and the drivers, Daniel Ricciardo and Nico Hulkenberg, about the new challenges facing F1.
Tricky rules and trickier tech
If you haven't been following F1 for awhile -- you wouldn't be alone -- here's a quick explainer on the major new rules and cutting-edge technology.
In the '80s heyday of F1 power, BMW's 1.5-liter M12 engine produced up to 1,500 horsepower. While that created incredible speeds (and sounds), the cars were extremely wasteful. Since 2014, F1 cars have packed complex turbocharged hybrid engines, converting half the fuel energy to road power. "The rules right now in Formula 1 push the renewable element and the efficiency," said Renault engine technical director Remi Taffin during the French Grand Prix.
The motors, so complex that they're called power units, tap energy that's normally wasted from the turbocharger and braking to charge a small battery. This then feeds energy back to an electric motor, making them more efficient than any diesel or gasoline engine. "In Formula, there's really that desire to burn less gas on each lap," said Renault Sport Racing hybrid engineer Nicolas Espesson.
F1 teams have also pushed the development of these motors -- both in power and efficiency -- at an incredible rate. "Compared to 2014, the power output [in 2019 cars] is 109 horsepower greater using the same amount of fuel," Mercedes has said.
On top of that, F1 has numerous rules that limit the way cars can operate. Teams are limited to five engines per car per season, rather than swapping out power units after every race. "We used to have motors that could last for about 300 km (200 miles), now we have motors that have to go for 7-8,000 km (4,400-5,000 miles)," said Taffin.
There are further restrictions on wind tunnels, road testing, computer simulations and, particularly, racing, with stewards watching for illegal or dangerous incidents. The main aim is to increase driver safety, limit the financial advantages of richer teams and keep the sport competitive. The latter two objectives have been wildly unmet, however.
Insane tech requires equally insane bank balances
Renault might be one of the largest car builders in the world (in alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi), but when it comes to F1, its budget is far below the top-spending teams of Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull. That's because it's limited by parent Renault, which must answer to its investors.
According to team financial figures (compiled by Racefans.net), Ferrari spent $410 million, Mercedes $400 million, Red Bull $310 million, McLaren $220 million and Renault $190 million in 2018, not including marketing and driver salaries. "Clearly a massive performance gap exists between the 'big three' -- Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull -- and the rest," said Racefans. "This is reflected in the size of their budgets."
It costs about $100 million to design and field an F1 car, with the rest of the budget going to development. That means that Renault has just $90 million to spend on future designs, compared to $300 million for Mercedes.
A lot of that budget goes on R&D -- which was apparent when I visited Renault's F1 manufacturing and design facility in Enstone, UK. The company recently spent about $60 million updating the facility, which it re-acquired from Lotus in 2015.
In a bid to keep teams competitive regardless of budget, the rules restrict certain design aspects. Wind tunnel use is limited to 60 hours and 68 individual test runs per week, and teams must use 60 percent maximum scale models with winds no faster than around 120 mph. Even aerodynamic simulation (CFD or computational fluid dynamics) testing is limited. Winter track testing takes place over just eight days and in-season testing happens over four two-day sessions.
Teams have to make the most of every test.
The Enstone facility produces just four or five cars, each one worth a reported $70 million. It takes about 150,000 hours and 15,000 parts to make each one. Renault employs more than 100 designers that work in an open space "white room" to create around 20,000 CAD drawings.
The parts are made of exotic materials like titanium, advanced carbon fiber and a high-nickel alloy called Inconel used for exhaust systems. Many of them are manufactured in a clean, dust-free room with finely controlled temperatures and air pressure.
Renault also has a 30,000 square foot wind tunnel and state-of-the-art observation room where 20 engineers monitor each race. It also has a highly advanced car simulator that lets engineers test vehicle design tweaks.
To justify all this expense and the idea of operating a factory F1 team in the first place, Renault pitched it as a marketing opportunity, particularly in Asia. "We lacked a marketing tool to develop the name Renault in countries where it wasn't known and to make the image of Renault more attractive," said Renault Sport president Jerome Stoll. "In the Chinese market, which is a very targeted part of Renault's expansion ... we've had particularly good exposure with this sport that is well represented on TV, radio, etc."
"At the same time, when we get a good result, we have a lot more people interested in the brand and interested in coming to Grand Prix," Stoll added during the Castellet race.

The UK Government’s mechanism for supporting low-carbon electricity generation is the Contracts for Difference (CfD), which have been awarded to two developers in the Outer Hebrides - Muaitheabhal Wind Farm and Druim Leathann Windfarm. However, a large development Stornoway Wind Farm, has not achieved the vital CfD.
Leader of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Councillor Roddie MacKay said of the annuoncement: “It is good news that two out of three local developers have achieved a CfD.
“It is hugely disappointing, however, that Stornoway Wind Farm has not achieved a CfD.
“We will be speaking to developers to understand how they wish to proceed in light of this news.
“We will be speaking to SSE and Ofgem to see what their proposals are to connect the CfD projects and the pipeline projects to the grid.
“We will also be urgently engaging with the UK Government to ensure they make good on their promise to deliver an inter-connector to the Outer Hebrides.”
Stornoway Wind Farm has consent for up to 36 turbines with a maximum capacity of 180MW and is a joint 50-50 venture between EDF Renewables and Wood under the umbrella ‘Lewis Wind Power’.
EDF Renewables owns and operates 35 wind farms and a battery storage unit across the UK and is part of EDF Energy, which produces 40% of Scotland’s electricity.
Wood is a global leader in the delivery of project, engineering and technical services in energy, industry, and the built environment.
Responding to the notification of the outcome of the third Contract for Difference Allocation round, Mark Vyvyan-Robinson, Lewis Wind Power director, said: “Obviously, we are all incredibly disappointed not to have secured a Contract for Difference after a huge amount of work by the team to make the project as competitive as possible.
“We now need to take some time to look at all the options for the project, and to assess what we believe to be the best way forward for the wind farm.
“We will keep our partners and the local community updated as we work our way through these options.”

Everything Is Faster
Matt Harris, the head of IT at the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport Team, says HPE technology and services have made everything a “bit faster, a bit quicker, a bit better.”
That’s no small matter given the importance of technology in the intensely competitive world of Formula 1 racing.
“If I can make your job more reliable, faster and better, that will support with adding laptime to the car,” says Harris.
Technology is crucial in the Formula 1 world where one tenth of a second separates winners from losers.
“Technology is key to everything we do whether that is event simulations, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) for the car, upgrade ideas, or strategies, like should we pit under a safety car or not?” said Harris, who has headed up IT for Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport for the last decade.

It's no surprise that Formula 1 is heading for a complete overhaul with the next decade and we got a first real glimpse at this change with the 2021 F1 car design. A recent video released by F1 showcased the 50 per cent sized model of a 2021 F1 car testing at Sauber's wind tunnel in Switzerland. This, of course, isn't the final design but gives a close look at what the final race car will look like. Notable changes include the shorter front wing, new floor design, newly contoured side pods and the shorter rear wing. The rear diffuser too gets a simpler design. We also get a good look at the new 18-inch wheels with Pirelli tyres and slimmer sidewalls, which will replace the current 13-inch units. F1 does say that the front wing will evolve as testing continues but the new side pods and smaller rear wing are likely to remain the same.
The shorter rear wing is here to stay, while another welcome addition are the new 18-inch wheels
The 2021 F1 car will work on reducing the wake disruption in order to facilitate more passes and overtakes. The disruption level on current cars stands at 50 per cent, which makes it difficult for the following car to pass or come close, thereby reducing the number of passes in recent seasons. This has been one of the key concerns for the sport in general. F1 says the new cars will have a disruption of just 5-10 per cent and a change that both drivers and spectators will be looking forward to.
Speaking on the latest round of testing, F1's Chief Technical Officer Pat Symonds said, "The wind tunnel testing we are doing is slightly different to what the teams might do. The teams concentrate solely on the forces on the car, through a variety of attitudes as they move the car around. While we naturally have an interest in what those forces are and particularly how those forces change as the car moves, we're even more interested in what is happening to the turbulent air behind the car."
The wake disruption will be down to 5-10% from the current 50% allowing more overtakes
F1 and the FIA have spent an incredible amount of time, effort and resources in developing the 2021 car with the help of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), which is using some advanced techniques that aren't commonly adopted by the teams. The CFD development will be backed up by virtual and physical simulations.
"For that reason, although we are doing most of our development in CFD, and that CFD is using some pretty advanced techniques which aren't commonly used by the teams, we want to back up the virtual simulations with a physical simulation. We also chose to use a 50% model rather than a 60% model and we chose to run that model quite a long way forward in the wind tunnel, so this gave us the opportunity to best inspect the wake of the car," Symonds added further.
It's not just more passes that will be the key improvement on the 2021 F1 car. The new cars are also expected to lower development costs for the teams, which will make the sport overall more financially viable, especially for the independent teams. The new design is also expected to bring a more levelled playing field for all teams, which should averse a single team dominated season in favour of a more competitive field. We do expect to hear more about the new F1 cars for another year, along with new teams, engines, drivers and technologies set to feature what is the pinnacle of motorsport.

Country Fried Duck was closed for the month of October following the rejection of its liquor license on Sept. 27, 2018 by the N.C. ABC.
Myles Bacon, the former general manager of Country Fried Duck, said this was due to an inability to control clientele.
Since the October shutdown of Country Fried Duck, the business switched ownership, was rebranded as Night School and applied for a new liquor license. The bar’s website is still under the name “Country Fried Duck” and has the same online reviews for the old establishment.
Yelp and Facebook reviews and comments show the bar attracted many Chapel Hill visitors and residents, not just UNC students.
The new bar, however, tried attracting a new clientele, largely targeting UNC students. To attract this new demographic, Night School threw a party during the last week of fall 2018 classes, followed many UNC students on Instagram, advertised cheap drinks.
For many in the Chapel Hill community, the shooting incident came as a shock.
“Honestly, I’m surprised that happened. As a UNC student, I’ve always felt very safe around campus. There’s always campus police driving around, and I have never been in a situation like this," said first-year Dallis Alvarez.
Alvarez is a member of UNC’s Latin dance team, Que Rico, and was planning on attending “Latin Night” at Night School last Friday. The event was to be hosted by Mi Pueblo, a UNC Latinx organization. Mi Pueblo had hosted a few "Latin Nights" at Night School during the fall 2018 semester.
Mi Pueblo members thought the shots fired on New Year’s Day caused Night School’s recent shutdown and cancelled their Jan. 11 event.
The bar's rebranding tactics seemed to make it an attractive option for undergraduates and student groups, including Greek organizations and a cappella groups like the UNC Clef Hangers.
Night School’s Instagram account boasted full occupancy on most nights with more than 600 people on some occasions.
The Daily Tar Heel reached out to Night School to see if they wished to elaborate on the events that have transpired in the recent weeks, but nobody affiliated with the bar responded by the time of publication.

A team of researchers from the Department of Chemical Engineering have utilised Virtual Reality (VR) technology for teaching fluid dynamics.
Matar Fluids Group (MFG) received funding from Imperial College London to develop the technology, with which they have created a VR programme that enables students to experience fluid dynamics from within a liquid flow with real-time feedback through touch and sound.
Bringing mathematical equations to life
Each student in the classroom is provided with a VR headset, headphones and two handheld controllers. As well as being able to view a liquid flow from 360 degrees on the outside, they are also able to dive in and see how the flow behaves from within. In addition, the programme enables them to manipulate particles and measure the impact of their movements, bringing to life the mathematical equations for these processes.
In one simulation, a flow of liquid is presented in a pipe. Users can shoot particles into the pipe and observe how they travel down it, seeing how they move faster at the centre of the pipe and slower near the edge.
In addition to visual cues, students are able to hear and feel the impact of pressure. When the pressure of the liquid flow is higher, a high-pitched sound can be heard and a vibration felt in the handheld controllers – much like the rumblepack on a games console.
Third year undergraduate Aniket Chitre said: “It’s quite cool how they’ve made it sound near the walls of the pipe. The stress is higher near the walls and quieter near the centre.
I think I’ll remember this better than a mathematical derivation – it solidifies learning in a more memorable way”.
Student partnership
The project has been developed in partnership with students from its inception, with undergraduates leading in the design of the interface as part of an Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programme (UROP). By converting Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) files into VR design software, they created the visual element of the experience – in other words, the entire VR ‘world’. Undergraduate student reps also worked closely in partnership with the team to provide feedback and ensure its features meet learning needs.
MFG says that traditional lectures in fluid mechanics rely heavily on mathematics, with little opportunity for practical activities. Now they have a solution, which will provide a more interactive learning experience.
Professor Omar Matar, Head of MFG and Vice Dean (Education) said: “While the students will be exploring fluid flows in a 4-D environment, they will also hear the pressure and physically experience forces. It is believed that such a teaching approach will result in elevated levels of understanding”.
Next steps
While undergraduate students are learning the ropes on this new software, the team are exploring how it can be developed for other subjects within engineering and are actively working alongside researchers from the Dyson School of Design Engineering, and the Department of Earth Science & Engineering to facilitate this.
The funding was provided by Imperial College London as the result of a successful bid to a pedagogy transformation fund linked to Imperial’s learning and teaching strategy.

Engine 126 is fit to drive to shops for inspection. Minor damage — Chicago Fire Media (@CFDMedia) August 6, 2019
CHICAGO (WLS) -- A Chicago Fire Department became stuck after part of a parking garage collapsed underneath it in the South Shore neighborhood Tuesday morning.The engine was parked on top of the two-story garage around 10:40 a.m. when part of the garage collapsed underneath the engine onto the bottom level. The front bumper of the fire engine was resting on a section of the garage that had not collapsed."They moved out of the way today to let a lady pass by that was in a private auto, and when they were backing up that's when the collapse occurred," said CFD Chief of Special Operations Tim Walsh.A crane arrived about 5 p.m. to assist with removing the engine. Crews were able to remove the engine from the parking garage around 6 p.m. Engine 126 will drive to a shop for repairs, CFD said in a tweet."Engine 126 is here quite frequently, this is their still area, they parked in the usual spot, where they always park to let the ambulance back up to the doors," Walsh said.The fire department was responding to a call at the Symphony of South Shore nursing home next to the garage when the collapse happened. Workers inside the nursing home said it sounded and felt like an earthquake."We heard a big boom and we didn't know what it was, we checked around our facility to make sure it wasn't in the inside, we thought it was coming from the roof," said Tamika Wilson, who works at Symphony of South Shore."The engineer was able to crawl out rear door and call for help, the rest of the company was inside taking care of a medical patient," Walsh said.The engineer was taken to a hospital for delayed back pain from the collapse, Walsh said. No other injures were reported.Fire officials emptied the truck of 500 gallons of water to lighten the load.No cars on the top or lower level appeared to be damaged and no one was trapped beneath it, authorities said.

The pan-European regulator has issued positive opinions on the proposed national product intervention measures in Finland, Lithuania and Spain.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) continues to issue positive opinions about the proposed product intervention measures by National Competent Authorities (NCAs). The latest set of restrictions on the offering of CFDs and binaries to retail clients to get positive evaluation of ESMA come from Finland, Lithuania, and Spain.
In particular, ESMA’s positive opinions concern the CFD restriction measures proposed by Finland and Lithuania, as well as the proposed prohibition on the offering of binary options to retail investors in Finland, Lithuania, and Spain. There is barely anything surprising in the positive assessment by ESMA as the national measures outlined by Finanssivalvonta of Finland (FSA), Bank of Lithuania (LB) and Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores of Spain (CNMV) simply restate the product intervention measures already introduced by ESMA.
The NCAs are merely preparing for the moment when ESMA will stop renewing its measures, so that the same measures will remain in place at a national level.
Earlier in May, ESMA issued a positive opinion on proposed product intervention measures taken by Austria’s financial markets authority (Finanzmarktaufsicht or FMA). In April this year, ESMA issued positive opinions regarding the national product intervention measures introduced by three countries – Poland, the UK and the Netherlands.
In a recently published newsletter, the pan-EU watchdog made a brief remark regarding the cases where its opinion on the product intervention measures adopted by NCAs is negative.
“If ESMA concludes that a proposed national product intervention measure is not justified or proportionate it will say in its opinion. If an NCA proposes to take, or takes, action contrary to an opinion adopted by ESMA, the NCA shall immediately publish on its website a notice fully explaining its reasons for so doing”.

IIT Delhi opens CoE for promotion of computational abilities Team Careers360 | May 2, 2019 - 5:28 p.m. IST Share Via NEW DELHI, MAY 2: Solutions to engineering problems using data analysis and data structures get a big boost as IIT Delhi opens a Centre of Excellence for Promotion of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on its campus. The inaugural function was attended by IITD Director, Prof. V. Ramgopal Rao and Rafiq Somani, Area Vice President, India and South Asia, ANSYS, among others. Recommended
The CFD has come up a part of IIT Delhi’s Corporate Social Responsibility Agreement with ANSYS Software, the Indian arm of the US-based software developer. “ANSYS Software will fund the 3-year project to be carried out by the Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer at IIT Delhi,” said Somani. “This collaboration will improve the employability of PhD candidates and equip them with industry-relevant knowledge and skills in CFD that can result in more environment-friendly solutions for the future,” he added.
CFD is a tool that uses data analysis and data structures to translate solutions to a variety of engineering problems into products/processes in a faster, cost-effective way. CFD allows simulations of engineering processes, cutting across different disciplines, from aerospace, defence, automobile, power generation, chemical and mechanical engineering down to biomedical processes.
“This Centre will impart education to undertake cutting-edge research in Computational Fluid Dynamics and to harness the power of CFD-based simulation tools for the development of efficient and innovative products/processes,” said Prof. Vivek V. Buwa, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Delhi, who is the coordinator for the CoE.
The project aims to promote education and research in CFD while focusing on improving the employability of PhD scholars with a focus on women scholars.

Formula 1 teams will be able to run unrestricted simulations when it comes to developing their 2021 cars during the next year.
Previously, the sporting regulations had limited computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation time alongside wind tunnel testing in an attempt to control costs and keep the field closely matched. However, a tweak to the 2019 sporting regulations will see the FIA “allow unrestricted CFD simulations to be carried out for the development of cars in accordance with the 2021 regulations.”
F1 has been targeting a major aerodynamic rule change in 2021, with significantly different cars being introduced. The final regulations have yet to be confirmed, although some aerodynamic changes have been made for next season in order to gauge their impact on a car’s ability to follow closely, something the sport wants to improve with the 2021 designs.
As teams want to be able to start work on a major regulation change long in advance of its implementation, the CFD restrictions will be lifted only for work on the next generation of car.
The change was approved during a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in St. Petersburg, Russia, where the 2019 calendar was also ratified and a number of other minor amendments to next year’s sporting regulations were approved.
These included a change to safety car restart procedures, where cars will be kept under yellow flag conditions — and therefore not able to overtake — until they have crossed the start line when the safety car returns to the pits. Also approved was a move to ensure the way the grid is formed is clear when multiple penalties have been applied, and also the requirement for fuel handling procedures to be the same during testing as they are during race events.

Analysis of wind impact
Last month, the City of London Corporation unveiled new planning guidelines, requiring developers to do more analysis of the wind microclimate around proposed new buildings. It said that its proposals went beyond established thinking and set a new benchmark in planning.
But Nick Wirth, founder and technical director of Wirth Research, disagrees. He says that the new guidelines do not go far enough.
“With 13 new skyscrapers in the pipeline in London between now and 2026, it has never been more relevant to revisit the rules regarding new tall buildings,” said Nick Wirth. “The tougher guidelines… are clearly a step in the right direction, but they predominantly reflect the current industry ‘best practice’ rather than driving the situation significantly forward. In our opinion, they still do not go far enough.”
Historically, wind tunnel testing has been standard practice for assessing the wind impact of potential skyscrapers. Now, though, new developments will require computer simulations of wind effect – one of Wirth Research’s specialist areas – at the very beginning of the design process.
Nick Wirth is a former Formula 1 team owner and designer, and pioneered the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in motorsport. He has since transferred that to the built environment sector – with projects including Apple Park in California, 22 Bishopsgate and the Bloomberg European HQ in London.
Wirth Research has been collaborating in recent months with digital twin planning platform VU.City, providing CFD-generated wind analysis to help produce 3D city models.
Nick Wirth said that his company already operated to a higher standard than what the City of London has put forward. “Adopting more stringent demands should be a prerequisite across the board,” he said.
“Whereas traditional wind tunnels require model creation at 300:1 – which means any details smaller than one metre are very difficult to accurately capture – our CFD service provides resolutions down to 50mm, modelled in full scale. Couple this with the unrivalled precision of VU.City’s 3D models, and we are confident of delivering the most accurate and consistent 3D model of London to-date – and that exercise, of course, can be repeated in other cities around the country and throughout the world.”
Jason Hawthorne, co-founder of VU.City, said: “There’s actually no excuse for new buildings in London that don’t address the microclimate at ground level. Gone are the days when physical models had to be created and time booked in the wind tunnel. Using highly accurate digital modelling combined with computational fluid dynamics can quickly identify issues with wind, meaning proposals can be adapted in real time to find solutions and prevent costly mistakes.
“VU.City is collaborating with Wirth Research to test widescale simulations at a level previously unachievable. Nick Wirth developed the business on the back of many years owning and working with Formula 1 teams to do exactly this. That expertise now means we can look at the City to consider the cumulative effects of consented schemes.
“Other areas of London – and other cities – will also need to address this. VU.City’s modelling allows local authorities and developers to work together from a very early stage to see how the development of a whole area, rather than an individual site will impact cyclists and pedestrians.
“High-rise definitely has a role to play in the future of our cities, and using technology will enable this development to take place and still create spaces that are pleasant for everyone to use."

Sealed bid deadline pushed back by two weeks to 29 August
UK Energy Department BEIS has confirmed a legal challenge has been taken in relation to the current Contracts for Difference allocation round.
A spokesman told reNEWS: "We run the scheme lawfully and will be contesting this claim."
The department declined to specify the nature of the legal case or the organisation pursuing it.
"We can’t comment further due to ongoing court proceedings," added a spokesman.
Officials contacted qualified companies late last week to inform them of the development, according to multiple high-level sources in the offshore wind industry.
No further details have been disclosed to CfD3 participants, it is understood.
BEIS and its CfD delivery partners, which include National Grid’s Electricity Market Reform Delivery Body and the Low Carbon Contracts Company, will extend the sealed bid window dates beyond the 15 August deadline.
Sealed bidding will now be allowed until 29 August. The window opened on 8 August.
“It is very frustrating,” said one senior executive, who added that developers have been given very little information.
An independent audit process was due to run to 3 September with the first results expected between 6 and 9 September, however, industry insiders now expect these dates to change.
The EMR Delivery Body declined to comment. The LCCC said it is aware of industry concerns and queries but declined to comment.

Ways to trade forex
Investors have several options when deciding how to trade forex. They can invest directly by trading in the spot market where you buy the underlying currency itself at an agreed price in exchange for another currency. Alternatively, investors can trade derivative instruments within forex markets, like futures contracts or contracts for difference (CFD). Futures and CFDs have many functional similarities, however with CFDs, you have the added tax advantage of not being charged stamp duty.
How to trade CFDs on Forex
A contract for difference (CFD) is a popular type of derivative that allows you to trade on margin, providing you with greater exposure to the forex market. Instead of purchasing currency on the spot market, you buy or sell units of a given financial instrument depending on whether you think the underlying price will rise or fall. Trading forex CFDs comes with many advantages (e.g. not having to deposit the full value of a trade). Before someone trades FX CFDs, they must consider what factors move forex rates. CFD trading can magnify your wins as well as your losses.

Factors that influence forex rates
Differentials in inflation
There is a tendency for a rising currency value to be inversely correlated with the domestic inflation rate. Countries with consistently low inflation rates tend to display rising currency values because the purchasing power increases relative to other currencies, whereas countries with higher inflation typically see depreciation in their currency when compared to the currencies of their trading partners.
Differentials in interest rates
Higher interest rates present an opportunity for lenders in an economy to have a higher return relative to other countries. It is for this reason that higher interest rates attract foreign capital and this can cause the exchange rate to appreciate. Conversely, falling interest rates tend to decrease exchange rates. However, due to the fact that higher interest rates are used to combat inflation, the effects of foreign capital are mitigated if inflation in the country is substantially higher than that of others.
Current account deficits
The current account is the balance of trade between a country and the countries with which it trades. It reflects all payments between countries for goods, services and investment incomes. A current account deficit suggests that the country is spending more on foreign trade than it is earning. This means that the country is spending more foreign currency than it receives through export sales, and is consequently supplying more of its own currency than the foreign demand. The excess demand for foreign currency lowers the country’s exchange rate. It is worth noting that, sometimes, a current account deficit is merely a sign of a rapidly growing economy, and so in this case the effects of depreciation would be mitigated.
Political stability and economic performance
Foreign investment is drawn towards stable countries with strong economic performance and political stability, drawing foreign capital out of other countries. Conversely, poor economic performance and political turmoil will lead to a depreciating exchange rate due to a loss of foreign investment.

Basic forex trading strategies
Once you understand what factors move forex rates, you can then start to spot trends in the price movements. Here are three basic strategies to begin forex trading:
Trading the trend. Capitalise on market momentum by opening a position the moment a trend forms, and holding onto it until there is an indication of a trend reversal.
Day trading. Respond to short-term opportunities triggered by developing news or emerging trends, and close the position by the end of the day.
Scalping. By placing frequent intraday trades on small price movements, you have the potential to make smaller profits more frequently, as opposed to waiting for a bigger and clearer trend.
Combining an understanding of what moves Forex rates with a basic trading strategy is a good way to start trading forex CFDs. You can trade Forex CFDs with a margin of up to 30:1 at Capital.com today.
CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 81% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.

During the 2014 season, MotoGP development was broadly grouped into three areas - engine, chassis and electronics.
But the appearance of winglets on the front of the Ducati during 2015 pre-season testing kicked off a 'fourth dimension' of performance; aerodynamics.
Winglets had been seen before in 500cc/MotoGP, but never really caught on.
This time was different. Aided by engineers with F1 experience and using the latest aerodynamic modelling, Ducati were eventually able to produce effective levels of downforce at every circuit.
And when MotoGP moved to unified ECU software in 2016, the anti-wheelie value of the downforce became even more attractive, with wings soon sprouting from the front of rival machines.
The clampdown - on safety grounds, a claim fiercely challenged by Ducati - came for 2017, when normal 'protruding' wings were banned. But the door was left open for any downforce devices that could be 'integrated' into the fairing. Fairing updates were also limited to one per the season.
Technical Director Danny Aldridge was the sole judge of compliance with the new aerodynamic rules, prompting an escalating series of designs as manufacturers re-configured or exaggerated parts of previously accepted fairings.
The most controversial practice was the use of 'modular' fairings, which were homologated in maximum downforce specification but could legally be broken down and used in several smaller stages. So 'one' fairing design could behave like two, three or even four different fairings.
In came another set of rules for 2019, which ends the practice of modular fairings and also spells out precise dimensions (a box) within which the downforce features must fit.
"From the aerodynamic point of view, the 2019 regulations are certainly more restrictive, both because they prevent the modularity of the fairing, the possibility to apply or move parts on the fairing," said Ducati Corse general manager Gigi Dall’Igna, during Friday's team launch in Switzerland.
"And because they also restricted the size of the fairing. I expect the aerodynamic load will be slightly lower than on the 2018 bike.
"However, I hope that after having changed the aerodynamic regulations for two years in a row, now we have arrived at the stability of rules, which is the only possible cost-saving method in MotoGP."
Edoardo Lenoci is now talking aerodynamics, confirms Ducati use a lot of CFD to model aero followed by wind tunnel work.

In a new move, Ducati also invited its Aerodynamic Development manager Edoardo Lenoci on stage at the team launch.
"When I started to work in Ducati six years ago, my background and experience was based on F1," Lenoci said. "So you can see that for example, in Formula One there is a lot of money invested in aerodynamics development.
"What we've learned from that world and transferred to my experience here at Ducati was a different approach in terms of for example using specific tools, so identifying the correct tools and using them in a proper way."
In simple terms, Aerodynamic development falls into two categories; 'reality' (wind tunnel and track testing) and 'virtual reality' (computer simulations, CFD).
It is the latter which Ducati said it has exploited most for the new generation of MotoGP aerodynamics, with wind tunnel work used to fine-tune final designs.
"We introduced massive use of CFD, which is Computational Fluid Dynamics, that means the mathematical simulation of what happens around the bike in terms of aerodynamics," said Lenoci.
"In the past we used to develop bikes in the wind tunnel, so we used a full-scale model, made up of actual existing components, spare parts from existing bikes for example.
"By using the CFD, there are a couple of advantages, for example I can tell you on one side the huge amount of data coming out of simulations helps the engineers to understand with deep knowledge what happens on the bike in terms of aerodynamics.
"Because in the wind tunnel you cannot see pressure distribution or streamlines or stress distributions on the surface of the bike. While you have this in CFD. So when you go in the wind tunnel you just do optimisation work, which is as important as developing new concepts.
"On the other side you don’t have to wait for existing parts to be mounted on the bike as a model, so you can start your development earlier than before."
But it's not just a case of plugging in lots of computers, the difficult part is setting up and using a CFD package so that the results correlate accurately with what actually happens when on the race track (the same applies to wind tunnels), otherwise all the pretty diagrams generated have little meaning.
Numerous different mathematical equations can be chosen to simulate the unsteady and random nature of turbulent air flow, for example.
Asked how it felt to see the other MotoGP manufacturers forced to follow Ducati's lead and invest heavily in downforce fairings, Lenoci replied:
"Well, if you look maybe five years ago at a starting grid during a MotoGP race you would see all the bodywork of our competitors looked quite similar. And maybe some of them had not changed for years.
"Then in recent years a lot of aerodynamic details started to be mounted, even on our competitors bikes - strange appendages and stuff like that. And even depending on the rider.
"On one side, I can tell you that we are happy about that, because we started at the very beginning and maybe we were right in doing that investment of money and time.
"On the other side this is also motivating for us, because it gives you the pressure to push a little bit forward the level of development and new ideas to come."
Turning to the stricter 2019 regulations, Lenoci has faith that Ducati's aerodynamic methodology will meet any future challenges.
"As Gigi mentioned, the regulations have been changed in the last two years in terms of what was available and possible in terms of making new aerodynamics," he said.
"For sure as engineers, we would like that these kind of changes would have been aimed at improving the performance, but sometimes this is not the case so it's just a matter of reducing or limiting, for example for cost reductions, as happened before.
"My opinion is that there are so many areas to be explored in terms aerodynamics and in any case our methodology we are going to use will be the same and will allow us to take the chance to face the new challenges no matter where they come from."
Ducati's 2019 fairing was not shown at the team launch and will remain under wraps until the final pre-season test.
"In Qatar, immediately before the opening race of the season, we will test the new fairing, as usual," Dall’Igna said.

Formula One has released images of a prototype 2021 model in a wind tunnel as it continues to work on the next generation of race cars.
F1 is set for a complete overhaul of the current regulations and hopes the new rules will create cars which can deliver closer racing and more overtaking.
Downforce lost by following a car, for example, will decrease from 50% to only 10%, which will reduce the effect of turbulent air on the car behind.
The new 18” wheels could also be seen in the 2021 model, as well as covers to control airflow.
Racing chief Ross Brawn has assembled a team to analyse data, and has even brought drivers into the process to help shape the rules which will be published at the end of October.
About the new regulations, F1 chief technical officer Pat Symonds said: “The wind tunnel testing we are doing is slightly different to what the teams might do.
“The teams concentrate solely on the forces on the car, through a variety of attitudes as they move the car around. While we naturally have an interest in what those forces are and particularly how those forces change as the car moves, we're even more interested in what is happening to the turbulent air behind the car.
“For that reason, although we are doing most of our development in CFD, and that CFD is using some advanced techniques which aren't commonly used by the teams, we want to back up the virtual simulations with a physical simulation.
“We also chose to use a 50% model rather than a 60% model and we chose to run that model quite a long way forward in the wind tunnel, so this gave us the opportunity to best inspect the wake of the car."
As well as changes to the cars, F1 wants to introduce a budget cap with the goal of having the playing field closer together and not to have huge gaps between the teams.
This last rule, though, is still in discussion, but one thing is for sure, every F1 fan would love to see closer racing and more teams challenge the giants of Mercedes and Ferrari.

The French financial markets regulator is seeking public comments on how to implement measures analogical to those introduced by ESMA at a national level.
France’s financial markets authority AMF has earlier today announced the opening of Consultation regarding measures restricting the offering of CFDs and banning the offer of binary options to non-professional investors at a national level.
The idea behind the proposals is to have rules for investor protection, analogical to those introduced by ESMA. These rules are set to work at a national level. Broadly speaking, the restrictions proposed by the French regulator are identical to those outlined by ESMA. The list includes negative balance protection and leverage restrictions for CFDs, for instance.
The public consultation is open until April 15, 2019. Feedback has to be sent to directiondelacommunication@amf-france.org.
This regulatory move by France has been largely expected given the recent comments by AMF’s chairman Robert Ophèle. Back in October 2018, he warned that serious problems had become apparent since the introduction of the new ESMA rules. He explained that these problems are due to the temporary nature of the product intervention measures, that is, that these measures last three months and then have to be renewed. This duration, according to Mr Ophèle, is too short and may increase certain risks.
According to Mr Ophele, it is particularly worrying that, once ESMA does not renew the rules for CFDs and binary options, there will be a multitude of national regimes regarding the offering of these products. This will result in chaotic surveillance of products that are marketed online.
Let’s note that a number of European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands have also sought to introduce measures analogical to ESMA’s restrictions for the offering of CFDs and binary options to retail clients.

Waitrose is to introduce an ‘invisible door’ that it is claimed has the potential to save British retailers a combined £1.5bn per year by reducing their energy bills.
Wirth Research’s AirDoor concept prevents warm air being lost from the store during colder temperatures and cold air being lost during warmer temperatures as customers enter and leave.
The technology derives from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of air flow carried out in motor racing. Wirth Research president Nick Wirth is a former technical director of Virgin Racing’s Formula One team and in the late 1990s was chief designer for the Benetton team.
Wirth’s AirDoor provides an archway that sits outside the store, around the frame of the entrance. It incorporates an array of sensors to detect airflow in both directions, which is then counteracted by an opposing, self-generating wind. The result is an invisible, active ‘barrier’, preventing unwanted outside air flowing into the building and inside air escaping. There is minimal disruption to the customer and it negates the need for revolving doors or lobbies.
It is expected to perform particularly well in extreme temperature or pressure differences as well as strong winds.
Waitrose will introduce the AirDoor first at its Berkhamsted supermarket later this year. If it works there, it will be rolled out further.
Nick Wirth said: “AirDoor is a response to a global and increasingly urgent issue – and there is no direct competition. It represents a solution that improves the customer experience, delivers annual energy savings and reduces carbon emissions – exemplifying Waitrose as a standard-bearer in the supermarket industry when it comes to ‘green’ thinking. The UK high street is facing ever-greater competition from online retailers, but AirDoor combats this by incorporating the energy-saving advantages of an actual door without creating a physical barrier to the customer.”
Jim Burnett, Waitrose & Partners senior manager for technical services, said: “We are always looking to find innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment and while we know we still have a lot of work to do, the potential of the AirDoor could be key in helping us make our shops even more sustainable in the future.”
In early 2019, Waitrose rolled out the Wirth Research EcoBlade, a twin-bladed strip fitted to the front of fridge shelves to reduce cold air being lost into the aisles, using the same techniques that channel airflow more efficiently around racing cars to enable them to corner at higher speeds.
Development of the AirDoor was co-funded by the government’s Innovate UK programme.
Wirth Research used its own high-resolution CFD model to measure supermarket energy loss caused by wind infiltration, based on weather, door opening data and building dimensions for three different-sized stores. From this, it calculated that each store spent between £5,000 and £10,000 to compensate for energy loss.

UW Coach and Freshman Make Cheyenne Finals Beau Clark has been busy recruiting and he's succeeded bringing in a raging new addition of transfer students and high school kids for next fall's University of Wyoming rodeo team. He had not, until Tuesday, had any luck competing as a steer wrestler at Cheyenne Frontier Days. Coach Clark's fourth run giving steers a 30-foot head start at the 'Daddy' was a tutorial in a focused determination that should be absorbed by his rodeo kids as a valued lesson. Clark is moving on to the Sunday Cheyenne finals in which the line-up will include UW rodeo team all-around hand Caden Camp who just completed his freshman year. His time on Tuesday was 9.4 which was the best time of the day. Plus a check for $1411.

Think NASCAR is nowhere near as advanced as F1? A man who knows tells us otherwise
You wouldn’t win a medal for identifying differences between Formula 1 and NASCAR. But Ford’s NASCAR aerodynamic supervisor Tommy Joseph tells us that things are much more similar than you might think. And he should know, having two years ago moved to the American stock car series after an extended spell as an F1 engineer.
"There was quite a bit of carryover from F1 to NASCAR," Joseph explains. "Even I didn’t know how much technology there was in NASCAR before I started working there.
"A lot of that was because F1 was a technically minded sport and people talk about that technology a lot; NASCAR isn’t seen like that.
"People watch it for the racing and maybe even the crashes, but the fans don’t see the tech. It is there, though. You can tell by the race results that the best drivers with the best car tend to win – much like F1.
"Last season they were talking about the big three drivers [Martin Truex Jr, Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch] and they’re not just there because of driver skill – they’re driving good cars as well. It’s just not talked about in NASCAR as much as it is in F1."
Even I didn’t know how much technology there was in NASCAR before I started working there
Joseph’s F1 CV started early, from when he undertook a master’s degree at Southampton University.
"Every F1 team apart from Ferrari used that wind tunnel in the 1980s before they decided to build their own," he says.
"During my time there, I took up a project with BAR Honda to build a land speed record car. That was my first experience working with an F1 team and my first deep dive with F1-spec CFD [computational fluid dynamics] and wind tunnel testing."
After that Joseph worked for Williams from 2006 until ‘11, Sauber in 2011-12 and then Red Bull as Peter Prodromou picked him up from Sauber.
"There was a step up in resources from Sauber to Red Bull and Prodromou and Adrian Newey were the best of the best when it came to aerodynamicists," Joseph explains.
"We had a mission control room as there was a limit of 65 personnel allowed at the track, so we worked remotely sometimes communicating with the engineers at the track, processing gigabytes and gigabytes of data from the thousands of sensors attached to the cars."
Then in early 2017 Joseph made his NASCAR switch, to Ford and working on the Mustang body that has just debuted as the successor to the Fusion.
"Engineering levels in NASCAR are always increasing – you can always look back after a year and it’ll look primitive," Joseph continues. "In NASCAR, and for some time in F1, people were doing things by trial and error but that takes time and it’s not as predictable.
"A better way to do any time of product development is through data driven engineering like wind tunnel testing and CFD testing."

There are differences between NASCAR and F1 though. The main problem with NASCAR CFD testing is that simulating 40 cars on track is much more difficult than simulating a couple of F1 cars. So while Toyota may benefit from having recent F1 experience, the carryover in technology doesn’t apply completely.
"It could be an advantage for Toyota to have more recent F1 experience but CFD is very complex," explains Joseph, "because unlike stress analysis and other things that rely on equations, CFD has a model and it’s down to computational expenses.
"There’s guesswork and a lot of analysis that goes on.
"If you take a normal F1 track, you have 20 cars running over 5km whereas in NASCAR you have 40 cars and the track is less than half the length of a standard F1 track. So the cars per unit distance can be four times higher, and so the behaviour of the car in another car’s wake is more important. And we also have banking and walls to deal with."
So in some ways, it’s more complex to model fluid dynamics with stock cars, but with fewer wings and aerodynamic components on the stock cars themselves, F1 and NASCAR are just as complex as each other.
And while you may think that stock cars are all the same Joseph is quick to correct that, at least when it comes to the top-tier Cup Series.
"NASCAR is definitely not a spec series," he says.
"At Ford we’re not interested in a spec series. We want things to be different between the cars and there is enough tolerance in the rules to allow for differentiation and different ideas. In NASCAR, especially recently, there are OEM prescribed bodies but the tolerances can allow teams to work with the body."
NASCAR is just like F1 in that regard.
"If you look at the body with the Hawkeye optical scanning system [that NASCAR uses to make sure there are no rules infringments] there’s a window of opportunity for teams to make changes.
"And it takes some time to notice but if you look at the car close enough you can see areas that are pushed or pulled or moved one way or the other. Certainly on TV or far away they look the same but then again, zoomed out, in F1 the cars look the same.
"If you look closer you see curvature on the endplates and stuff. A lot of people do drawings or diagrams to illustrate those differences but you could do the same for NASCAR as well."
The big differences, of course, are obvious. And one of those is the budget.
"Our budget is definitely smaller [than those of F1 teams]," explains Joseph.
"One of our views about NASCAR is that it gives a great return and it markets our cars to our audience and we can develop techniques to bring back to the production car.
"The budget is lower but that’s a complaint that OEMs are having about F1 and that’s a major reason we don’t race there anymore," he adds.
And the tools that Joseph and his team have to model CFD are used in the World Rally Championship, Australian Supercars, the NHRA drag racing Mustang and other motor sport – as well as the road cars themselves. That’s a return on investment that F1 can’t boast.
How both series aim to improve overtaking
Both series are undertaking rule changes for the 2019 season in an attempt to improve the spectacle, with F1 making front wings simpler to reduce outwash and therefore wake, making it easier for cars to overtake.
NASCAR is also changing the aerodynamics of its stock cars, increasing the height of the rear spoiler and reducing power output among other things to improve – you guessed it – overtaking.
"The rule changes for 2019 bring an increase in downforce with much taller rear spoilers and a much bigger front splitter as well as design changes on the right-hand side, and all of those things produce more downforce," says Joseph.
By coincidence, Ford has a new car for 2019 – the Mustang – that it hopes will contend effectively with the likes of Toyota’s Camry and the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1.
Early signs are promising if the Daytona 500 is anything to go by, as Joey Logano in the new Mustang took fourth place in the race behind the Toyotas of Denny Hamlin, Kyle Busch and Erik Jones. But that’s restrictor plate racing, and in the following races starting with next weekend’s bout at Atlanta, cars will sport the 2019 rules package.
That’s when we might see the fruits of Ford’s three-year effort in constructing the NASCAR Cup Series Mustang.
As for the rules changes themselves, the jury is out on whether a huge decrease in power – from around 850hp to 550hp at most tracks – is the way to improve the spectacle.
While F1 manufacturers were boasting about reaching the 1000hp mark with their power units last year, stock cars will be slower this season.
Perhaps hybrids are the way forward, then. At least, Ford boss Mark Rushbrook seems to think so.

As time has progressed UK Brokerages have reduced their sales department, constructed tight management teams and have began to rely on the necessity of partners, affiliate and IB’s to bring business, reducing in the number of ‘Powerhouse’ brokerages, says Reece Pawsey, Director of FinTop Consulting
By Reece Pawsey, Director and Co-Founder, FinTop Consulting
This is a question every Recruiter, HR Manager and CEO is asking themselves. If we break down this article down into 3 Large Forex Markets, the UK (FCA), Australia (ASIC) and Cyprus (CySEC), we can clearly access and ensure that every reader of this article is prepared for their Broker to be at the forefront of this Recruitment Boom.
Stating with the UK Forex Market, in 2018 pre MiFID II we saw a large increase in the need for experienced Compliance professionals with the average salary ranging between £120-140k per annum for a Head of Compliance CF10/11 and the need for Sales professionals with an existing book of clients of IB’s and partners increase.
However, as time has progressed UK Brokerages have reduced their sales department, constructed tight management teams and have began to rely on the necessity of partners, affiliate and IB’s to bring business, reducing in the number of ‘Powerhouse’ Brokerages.
Dan Moczulski, CEO of Star Financial Systems, a firm who supply brokerage software to the industry globally comments “We tend to sell to growing brokers who expanding their business, and so naturally our client mix migrates to the territories and firms that has been doing well. Over the last 4 years regulation has been dictating which territories have been doing well.”
On Wednesday 1st July, the FCA released an article confirming that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is permanently on-boarding the ESMA intervention restricting the sale, marketing and distribution of CFDs and CFD-like options to retail customers to a leverage of 30:1.
As a result this gives little hope of an increase in volumes unrelated to volatility. Overall, the UK is prominent figure in the FX Space but like most markets is currently experiencing a slight dip in Company growth, with regards to headcount.
Whilst the FCA and ESMA were restricting Retail Brokerages, ASIC monopolised on this opportunity and attracted a lot of Global Retail Investors. This resulted in a surge in recruitment with the market well on the way to be a safe haven for Global Retail Investors. However, with ASIC deemed to be following in the same footsteps as ESMA, this may reduce in Brokers being more conscious of their Regulatory situation and manage their headcount accordingly.
Cyprus, the current home of retail Forex, is relatively consistent following the ‘dark days’ of Binary Options. It still draws the attention of several Global Brokerages like London Capital Group, Tickmill and ForexTime all of whom have operational offices there.
Cysec, the Cypriot regulator has recently indicated a willingness to offer a third tier of investor, slightly more experienced than retail and enjoying les draconian leverage limits. This may boost volumes, and therefore recruitment. The 300 Days of Sun a year, reasonable cost of living and large talent pool remains the go to location for Forex and those looking to get into the industry.

The cycling world has become infatuated with aerodynamics. One particular brand even goes as far as to state that aero is everything. While that might not technically be 100 per cent accurate, an aerodynamic helmet certainly has its benefits, a notion reiterated by the fact that the majority of the WorldTour peloton utilise aero helmets for all but the hilliest of days.
The benefits provided by aero helmets have long been explored by time triallists, a discipline where innovation is rife and every possible time-saving measure crucial. However, over the past decade, the marginal-gains mentality has seen it filter onto the road, in turn leading to the creation of the aero road helmet.
Related Best road bike helmets 2019 If you're happy to forgo the marginal gain of an aero helmet in favour of greater ventilation or a few saved grams, check out our roundup of the best road bike helmets.
In that time, the aero road helmet has fast become a common sight on the heads of road cyclists of all abilities, as riders are sold on the prospect of higher speeds for fewer watts – cycling’s holy grail if you will.
The aero road helmet is easily distinguishable by its profile, often featuring a smooth frontal area with a decreased quantity of air vents. Occasionally the rear will extend to guide the passing air beyond the rear of the head with minimal turbulence.
With the reasonably large frontal area of a cycling helmet it makes sense that the easier it can slice through the air, the higher the speed and less power output required. This is where a breakaway specialist might see the attraction and, of course, a time trialist, for whom that extra half a kilometre per hour could mean the difference between winning and losing.
This is also particularly attractive to cyclists who want to save as much energy as possible, such as sportive riders who have long distances to cover, sprinters who need the energy for that final huge effort, and even commuters who just want to get to work feeling fresher.
Things to consider when buying an aero helmet
Best cheap road bike helmets for 2019 If you're looking for a new road bike helmet, but you're on a budget, then our roundup of the best cheap road bike helmets is for you.
Safety
This ought to be the first consideration for anyone buying a new helmet. After all, the whole purpose of the cycle helmet is to protect your head in the event of an accident. All helmets in this test will have passed the relevant regional industry-required standards, however, others go beyond the call of duty by utilising technological innovations such as MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System), which is a 'slip-liner' that enables the helmet to rotate independently of the head during impact. This means that during angular impacts, more energy is absorbed by the helmet, rather than being transferred to the rider’s head.
Speed
More accurately, aerodynamics. The majority of helmet manufacturers will make aerodynamic claims about their helmets, usually a saving of power or an increase in speed, based from their own in-house testing. Sadly, we don't have a wind tunnel at our disposal, so we’re at the mercy of these claims and personal feel. We're aware feel is subjective, so where possible, we will try to standardise these claims to make them easily comparable.
Comfort
A helmet may make you ride faster but if you're stopping mid-ride to adjust the fit, then all of those precious seconds you've saved will be wasted. Of course, fit is very personal and, as such, we shan't focus too greatly on this.

Weight
The gradient at which weight has a greater effect on speed than aerodynamics is approximately six per cent. Based on this, for the majority of the time, weight should be a secondary consideration but one worth noting nonetheless.
Ventilation
While ventilation might not be the primary focus when searching for an aero road helmet, it's a worthy consideration – especially for those riding in hot climates. Aerodynamics and ventilation in cycling helmets tend to have a degree of mutual exclusivity, however, some manufacturers claim to take advantage of the Venturi effect, which in short, states that air will accelerate when pushed through a small hole. This means that air can be guided into small air vents and out of the back dragging the warm air out to aid cooling. Our reviews below will outline whether the manufacturer has considered this, along with the number of frontal vents, however, vent size is also worth noting.
Aesthetics
Looks may be completely irrelevant to the performance of an aero helmet but it's still likely to be considered when it comes to making a purchase. Of course, it's completely subjective, so while this won't be a major consideration in our reviews, we may make the occasional reference to our opinion, and we will include as much detailed imagery as possible to ensure you can make an informed judgement.
Best for safety
S-Works Evade II MIPS ANGi
An aerodynamic helmet that focusses on speed, improves ventilation and adds a raft of safety features.
RRP: £230.00 | Aero claim: 50 seconds at 40kph over a standard road helmet | Frontal vents: 10 | Safety: MIPS and ANGi | Retention: Magnetic buckle, micro-dial adjustment | Sizes: 51cm to 63cm in S / M / L | Weight: 269g (medium) | Pro teams: Bora-Hansgrohe, Deceuninck-Quickstep, Boels Dolmans

Specialized's focus with the Evade II was to take their original aero helmet, and make it faster, lighter, and more ventilated. Specialized say the new Evade is as cool as a bare head while saving six seconds over the previous Evade. Developed in their own wind tunnel, dubbed the Win Tunnel, Specialized claim this is the fastest helmet they've ever tested.
One of the unique features of the Evade II is Specialized's crash detection device, ANGi (angular and ground force interface). When paired with the Specialized app, if it detects an impact, a message will be sent to your pre-chosen contacts to notify them. Strava's Beacon feature offers a similar outcome but is triggered by speed decrease, which from experience, can lead to unwanted panic at a simple traffic light stop. The ANGi technology does come at a premium, with a non-ANGi equipped model is available at £30 less.
The Evade II comes with a 'gutter action' brow pad, which is designed to direct sweat away from the eyes and, in a nod to their female customer base, it uses their Mindset HairPort II micro-dial fit system, which aids ponytail management.
At the time of writing, the Evade II MIPS ANGi is available in three standard colours, along with two Peter Sagan Collection colourways.
Bontrager XXX Wavecel
Unmatched safety claims that come at the expense of some weight and a divisive aesthetic
RRP: £199.99 | Aero claim: None | Frontal vents: 7 | Safety: WaveCel | Retention: Boa dial adjustment | Sizes: 51cm to 63cm in S / M / L | Weight: 352g (medium) | Pro teams: Trek-Segafredo Men, Trek-Segafredo Women

The main talking point about the Bontrager XXX WaveCel helmet is the technology that Bontrager claimed to be 'cycling's most important change for 30 years'. This WaveCel technology is a honeycomb-like collapsible cellular structure that lines the inside of the helmet. It is claimed to be 48 times more effective than traditional helmets in protecting against head injuries during an accident. That said, although independent tests are yet to replicate these lofty claims; American testing facility Virginia Tech have WaveCel helmets occupying two of the top five slots in their independent tests.
While comfort and looks are completely subjective, the XXX WaveCel uses a Boa dial for adjustment, which in itself is rather large for a helmet dial. The mere fact that we found this an uncomfortable helmet wouldn't be worth a mention but similar feedback isn't hard to find online. It does have the option for vertical adjustment, but it can be difficult to find a comfortable spot. As for the looks, the green honeycomb styled liner is somewhat polarising.
As for the aerodynamics of the helmet, there are no specific claims made by Bontrager. However, if it's anything to go by, their original Ballista helmet did top our aero helmets wind tunnel test back in 2015, so it’s safe to say Bontrager know a thing or two about making fast helmets.
The final worthy mention is Bontrager's Crash Replacement Guarantee. If you have an accident in the first 12 months of ownership, Bontrager will replace your helmet free of charge.
Best for ventilation
Kask Protone
A popular and well-revered helmet that can be used in all conditions and for a range of cycling disciplines
RRP: £199.99 / US$249.00 / AU$365.00 | Aero claim: None | Frontal vents: 12 | Safety: In moulding EPS Foam | Retention: Octo fit, rubberised micro dial | Sizes: 52cm - 62cm in S / M / L | Weight: 215g (medium) | Pro teams: Team Ineos
Great all-rounder
Well ventilated
Range of colours
No rotational impact protection
The Kask Protone is a well-revered helmet that strikes a perfect balance between aerodynamics and ventilation. The 12 large frontal vents offer a great amount of airflow across the head, while the smooth rounded profile at the back helps guide air beyond the head with minimal turbulence.
Kask's 'Octo Fit' system serves to offer a range of adjustability to fit all head sizes. This offers a secure all-around fit, that holds the head in a secure, but comfortable fit. There is also an eco-leather chin strap, along with 3D dry padding, which both serve to offer additional comfort.
While the omission of a slip liner might be off-putting to some, the Kask Protone still surpasses the level of protection required by industry standards, including 'EN 1078', 'CPSC 1203' and 'AS/NZS 2063'.
POC Ventral Spin
A well-ventilated helmet designed with CFD to create an optimal balance of weight, aerodynamics and ventilation
RRP: £270.00 / US$290 / AU$495.00 | Aero claim: None | Frontal vents: 5 | Safety: SPIN | Retention: Dial adjustment | Sizes: 50cm to 61cm in S / M / L | Weight: 248g (medium) | Pro teams: EF Education First
Well ventilated
Price
The POC Ventral Spin helmet is not necessarily the first you'd look to when seeking an aero helmet, however, it's a contender worth considering for those who include ventilation as part of the equation.
Unlike POC's previous aero helmet, which consisted of little more than their Octal being fitted with a solid outer shell, the POC Ventral Spin underwent considerable aerodynamic and CFD testing throughout its development. POC adopted a 'whole-helmet approach', which they claim has helped to enhance aerodynamic performance and decrease air turbulence. Additionally, the air-flow design has been optimised in order to increase ventilation and thus accelerate cooling.
Like most of the helmets in POC's line-up, the Ventral uses SPIN technology (Shearing Pad INside) to protect your brain against the effects of oblique or rotational impacts.
Best multi-purpose
Giro Vanquish MIPS
An aero helmet that looks equally at home on the morning commute as it does in a time trial
RRP: £219.99 / $280.00 / AU$429.99 | Aero claim: 12 seconds faster than Ballista in a 40km TT at 400 watts | Frontal vents: 4 | Safety: MIPS | Retention: Roc Loc micro-dial adjustment | Sizes: 51cm to 63cm in S / M / L | Weight: 300g (medium) 52g visor. | Pro teams: Groupama FDJ, Canyon Sram

MIPS
Weight
The Giro Vanquish MIPS is the one helmet in this list that would look equally at home in a time trial as it will on the road. Designed using CFD and wind tunnel testing, Giro make some rather tough-to-compare aerodynamic claims about the Vanquish. When compared to a Bontrager Ballista, the Vanquish MIPS (with visor) will supposedly save 12 seconds in a 40km TT at 400 watts, and removing the visor will cost you two watts. They also claim a saving of 62 seconds in a 180km TT at 250 watts.
A stand-out feature is undoubtedly the removable Vivid Shield visor. It easily snaps into place thanks to three strong magnets and can also be flipped and affixed upside down. It’s worth mentioning that finding the exact position one-handed can often take a bit of adjustment, although removing and reattaching the shield mid-ride isn't a common occurrence. It uses optics by Zeiss, and is suitable for all but the most overcast of conditions. The helmet also plays well with standard sunglasses, even utilising the outer two of the four frontal vents as an eyewear dock.
During the development of the Vanquish, Giro have greatly considered the science of aerodynamics. The helmet takes advantage of the Venturi effect to channel air across the head and exhaust warm stale air, and the four-piece polycarbonate hardbody shell interlocks in such a way that it creates a step-down. Giro claim this tricks the air into behaving as it would with a traditional teardrop TT-shaped helmet.
Lazer Bullet 2.0 MIPS
A tech-compatible aero helmet with great safety features and flexible ventilation
RRP: £219.99 / US$269.95 / AU$449.00 | Aero claim: None | Frontal vents: Four plus 'Airslide' sliding vent | Safety: MIPS | Retention: Advanced Turnfit system | Sizes: 50cm to 61cm in XS / S / M / L | Weight: 315g (small) | Pro teams: Jumbo Visma, Sunweb, Corendon Circus, Madison Genesis
Feature-rich
Adjustable ventilation
Rear LED
Weight
The Lazer Buller 2.0 is a helmet that will capture tech-lovers' imaginations with the array of features that are available, some of which are standard but others will come at a cost.
However, before we get into these features, it’s worth stating the Lazer Bullet 2.0 is, as a standalone helmet, a worthy inclusion in this list. It features a MIPS slip liner for added impact protection, an 'Airslide' closeable vent, a magnetic clip-on panoramic Zeiss lens, and internal channelling that uses the Venturi effect to help you keep a cool head. It also comes with a rear LED light and reflective stickers to increase visibility in low-light conditions.
If your helmet has been involved in an accident it can be replaced at a reduced price of approximately 50 per cent for up to three years after the purchase date, however, the dealer’s discretion will dictate the exact discount you receive. This is limited to select countries, however; the UK and Australia are not currently included.
The Bullet 2.0 is compatible with Lazer's integrated helmet tech, meaning for an added fee, you can add the Inclination Sensor and the LifeBeam heart-rate monitor.
Other great aero helmets
Kask Utopia
A sleek-looking helmet with a comfortable retention system and a noise-reducing design
RRP: £219.00 / US$270.00 / AU$395.00 | Aero claim: 6w at 50kph over best rival | Frontal vents: 6 | Safety: In moulding EPS Foam | Retention: Octo fit, rubberised micro dial | Sizes: 50cm to 62cm in S / M / L | Weight: 235g (medium) | Pro teams: Team Ineos

No rotational impact protection
The Kask Utopia is the Italian brand’s aero-specific helmet. At the expense of a few grams and the frontal vents, the Utopia is claimed to save 'up to six watts than the most efficient rival helmet at 50km/h' which is 31mph. Bear in mind, the majority of other manufacturers make claims at 40km/h (25mph).
Kask haven't ignored ventilation though; the Utopia is said to be equally at home on climbs and in time trials. Using the Venturi effect, the way air is channelled through the internals of the helmet is claimed to improve both ventilation and aerodynamics.
The helmet is also designed to reduce wind noise around the ears, for a 'quiet ride experience', and features 5mm of moisture-wicking material called Resistex, which claims to take moisture away from the rider's head, moving it to the helmet's outer shell in order to improve comfort.
Abus Gamechanger
While calling a product 'GameChanger' is a bold move, the Abus helmet goes some way to live up to its name
RRP: £189.00 / US$235.00 / AU$369.00 | Aero claim: None | Frontal vents: 7 | Safety: EPS Foam | Retention: Micro dial | Sizes: 51cm to 62cm in S / M / L | Weight: 270g (medium) | Pro teams: Movistar
Aerodynamic whatever the head angle
Non-adjustable straps
One of the major attractions of Abus GameChanger is the fact that Abus have optimised the helmet's aerodynamics across a range of head tilt angles. So no matter what your position on the bike, you can be confident the helmet is cutting through the wind with ease.
The GameChanger is a highly adjustable helmet, meaning there should be a comfortable configuration for all head shapes and sizes. The 'FlowStraps' are aerodynamically positioned, skin-friendly chin straps that offer a close, yet comfortable, chafe-free fit. The one downside is that these straps don’t feature adjustable dividers, however, my race team and I have used this helmet for 18 months now and nobody has raised this as problematic.
Finally, the Gamechanger's aesthetics are somewhat divisive. However, you can at least be confident that you won’t be wearing the same as everyone else on the Sunday club run.
Met Manta
A dedicated aero helmet that still makes for a lightweight and well-ventilated helmet
RRP: £180.00 / US$225.00 / AU$349.00 | Aero claim: 10 watts at 50kph | Frontal vents: 7 | Safety: None | Retention: MET’s Safe-T Advanced micrometrical fit system | Sizes: 52cm to 62cm in S / M / L | Weight: 200g (medium) | Pro teams: UAE Team Emirates, Drops
Optional dial-mounted rear light
Weight
No dedicated eyewear dock
No rotational impact protection
The MET Manta was first launched at the 2015 Tour de France, ridden by the likes of Steve Cummings for the then MTN-Qhubeka team. The Manta claims a 10 watt saving at 50kph over 'other aero road helmets'. This is quite a dated claim, however, so while we have no data to prove the exact helmets tested by MET, the comparison will exclude a number of the helmets in this list, such as the S-Works Evade II and Kask Utopia which were launched in 2018.
One of the biggest positives of the Manta is the balance that MET have struck between a closed aerodynamic shape and good levels of ventilation. Users of the Manta are quick to remark at how well the helmet cools the head, rather than causing overheating.
The helmet's adjustment is facilitated by MET's Safe-T Advanced micrometrical system: a fancy way to say it has a small dial and vertical adjustment. Where it differs from some of its competition is that it tightens via a 360-degree ring around the head. The rear dial can also be replaced for one with a built-in light.
Bontrager Ballista MIPS
A great value helmet, with MIPS and a crash replacement guarantee
RRP: £129.99 / US$199.99 / AU$229.99 | Aero claim: None | Frontal vents: 3 | Safety: MIPS | Retention: Small Boa dial adjustment | Sizes: 51cm to 66cm in S / M / L / XL | Weight: 265g (medium) | Pro teams: Trek Segafredo, Trek Segafredo women’s

The Bontrager Ballista MIPS is, on paper, one of the best value aero helmets available. There are a number of features that make the Ballista stand out even in this category, and at £129.99, it's also one of the cheapest in this bunch. The construction feels solid, there is reflective detailing across the helmet, the inclusion of a MIPS liner increases rider safety, and with Bontrager's crash replacement guarantee, your helmet will be replaced free-of-charge if you have an accident in the first year of ownership.
While there are no specific aerodynamic claims from Bontrager, the original Ballista came out on top when we wind-tunnel tested helmets back in 2015. Given the shape hasn’t been greatly altered, we’re assuming the Ballista MIPS can still give its rivals a run.
There are a couple of negatives we've found with the Ballista MIPS. Frustratingly, the adjustable straps don't seem to sit flat on your face, they twist to a slightly uncomfortable position and catch the wind. Secondly, the overall profile is somewhat large for a given head size. This is purely aesthetic, though, and the weight and comfort of the helmet aren't affected.
Giant Pursuit MIPS
A good alternative to the more mainstream aero helmets, but there are no specific aerodynamic claims, and it carries a little more weight than most
RRP: £189.99 / US$263.00 / AU$ n/a | Aero claim: None | Frontal vents: 8 | Safety: MIPS | Retention: Cinch Pro | Sizes: 51cm to 63cm in S / M / L | Weight: 320g (medium) | Pro teams: CCC Team, CCC-Liv Women’s Team
Crash replacement guarantee

The Pursuit MIPS is touted by Giant as the ultimate in all-round aerodynamic performance. While no specific aerodynamic claims are made by the Taiwanese brand, they do claim that it minimises drag, producing maximum speed in real-world rider positions, and that the eight vents up front are 'drag neutral', which, when combined with internal channelling and vents at the back, allow for good airflow through the helmet without compromising aerodynamic performance.
Speaking of fit, the Pursuit MIPS is notable in its offering of two fit styles, Western (with a more oval shape) and Asian (with a more round shape). The Pursuit also uses Giant’s Element Strap System which combines with the MIPS Cinch Pro retention configuration to provide a secure fit with plenty of adjustment.

The two primary causes of complaints filed with EU national regulators in the first quarter of 2019 were the execution of orders (33%) and unauthorised business (14%).
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU’s securities regulator, has earlier today published the second Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities (TRV) report for 2019. The document includes data about investor complaints received by national competent authorities (NCAs) in the EU in the first quarter of 2019.
The overall number of consumer complaints made to NCAs rose in the first quarter of 2019, marking the highest level in a year. ESMA offers interpretation of the trends via comparison with events from the past few years.
In particular, the pan-EU regulator notes that 1H16 saw a spike in aggregate complaints, attributable to underlying issues in relation to contracts for differences (CFDs) and binary options in 2015 – complaints being a lagging indicator – and issues around bank resolutions.
The two primary causes of complaints filed with NCAs in 1Q19 were the execution of orders (33%) and unauthorised business (14%). The execution of orders has been a leading cause of complaint since 2016. Complaints relating to investment advice, which had been the second most common cause in 2017, were lower in much of 2018 and in 1Q19. One reason for this trend was a spike in complaints recorded with one NCA in 2H17 about the provision of advice concerning certain investment vehicles.
Regarding the type of financial instrument cited in complaints, the proportion of complaints referring to debt securities fell substantially over the last two years, at 7% in 1Q19 compared with 46% in 2Q17. This trend was driven by firm credit events and bank resolutions in more than one country that had previously led to complaints.
ESMA did not renew its temporary measures, under MiFIR product intervention powers, restricting the offer of CFDs to retail investors and prohibiting the offer of binary options to retail investors, as most national regulators introduced their own permanent intervention measures on a national basis that are at least as stringent as ESMA’s measures. ESMA’s measures in relation to binary options and CFDs, which applied throughout the EU, applied for one year from July 2, 2018 and August 1, 2018, respectively. Back then, ESMA, along with NCAs, identified a significant investor protection concern in relation to CFDs and binary options offered to retail investors.
ESMA has been critical of the CFD restriction measures proposed by some national regulators. Thus, for instance, ESMA has criticized Poland’s KNF because the Polish product intervention measures with regard to CFDs envisaged lower margin requirements for more experienced traders. ESMA stated that it does not consider that lowering margin requirements for experienced clients is appropriate. Nevertheless, Poland implemented the planned measures regardless of the stance of the pan-EU watchdog.

An Elphinstone graduate was part of the University of Victoria team that was awarded first place at the 13th annual SAE Formula Hybrid Competition, hosted every year by the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.
Gabe Goerzen, a mechanical engineering student at UVic who graduated from Elphi in 2017, took home the honours last week with a team comprised of eight other UVic students.
article continues below
Using a unique electricity-storage design, the students won the U.S. contest to design, build and race a hybrid-powered formula race car.
The team’s innovative design also landed them the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Engineering the Future award.
Goerzen, the youngest team member, acted as project coordinator and was instrumental in the design and bodywork of the race car. He conducted aerodynamic analysis using CFD software (Computational Fluid Dynamics), managed project timelines and competition deliverables, and oversaw communications and social media.
A total of 35 teams from around the world designed, constructed and put their cars through a number of tests and timed trials before the winner was declared.
“This competition really taught our team a lot about what industry employers are looking for and engineering methodology,” the UVic team said in a statement after the competition. “We got an amazing chance to collaborate and network with other teams and professional automotive engineers, making great connections with some potential future employers.”
Team members said the big advantage for UVic was the lighter weight of a capacitor-based system compared with lithium-ion batteries used by the other teams. Basically, the UVic car put out more power per unit of mass than its competitors. Mechanical energy for the hybrid system was supplied by a 250cc motorcycle engine.
This was the fifth time UVic has entered a team. It is also the second time UVic has won. It took first in 2016.

Swap-free trading with IG explained
An IG swap-free CFD account enables you to trade a range of futures contracts. By their nature, futures contracts are free from interest charges or swaps and instead you trade the asset at an agreed price – which, when you trade with IG, is priced directly from the underlying market.

Use your data wisely – and your wallet; AFX Group’s $28 million black hole, and Australia’s CFD providers do the right thing
In this weekly series, I look back on what stood out, what was bemusing, amusing and interesting during my weekly travels, interesting findings within the FX industry and interaction with an ever-shrinking big wide world. This is purely observational and for your enjoyment.
Monday: Data, its value and the hot air that surrounds it
Today’s online financial markets businesses have reached a very important milestone in that the environment in which they operate has become advanced and somewhat saturated at the same time.
Additionally, the now long established firms have to deal with an onslaught from the challenger banks and the new, application based all-in-one companies that promise everything on one platform.
One of the financial services industry’s Achilles heels in the past has been its inability to make the most of client data to the point of the word ‘dead leads’ having been a common phraseology in retail brokerages for some years now.
Recently, the words ‘enrichment of data’ have begun to filter into the corporate vocabulary, with some individual people, often from outside the FX industry, charging brokerages an absolute fortune for what they market as the cure all solution for a very important issue, that being the inability to make good return on investment from the client data that is already languishing on the CRM of a brokerage.
I have met one or two of the individuals who are self-described experts at refining and enriching data, but the reality is that the Montgolfier brothers would have benefited from that much hot air whereas the brokerage sector really does not.
During times of low profit margins, it is very easy to fall for the smoothness of a marketing orientated person who, for a fixed contract rate of an absolute fortune per month, will promise to refine and maximize client data to the extent of providing an ability to target people based on their interests, behavior and consumer requirements.
I have yet to see any value in any of this, and in some cases have witnessed data enrichment ‘gurus’ attempting to steal leads from brokers or even approaching me for databases of email addresses which is an absolute breach of GDPR regulations and is also a revelation of the limitations of ability.
The reason that it is important to get data enrichment right and not to be tempted to pay tens of thousands of dollars per month to a snake oil salesman with no credentials is that the smart money is now moving in and the new, app based challengers, flush with their massive venture capital investments are going down the in-house data enrichment route.
On Monday, this was demonstrated to me in the form of Tink, which despite its very odd name, is a clever FinTech company which purports to be the ‘rails and brains of open banking’.
One of the core activities of Tink, which connects major banks as its customers to a series of services via an open API, is data enrichment.
The company states that categorisation evolves continuously to ensure a more complete, accurate and useful capture of a user’s financial information. Machine-learning model use population-wide and individual preferences to generate the highest quality data. Tink promises to transform raw data into tangible insights for banks and financial services companies to utilize in order to prevent churn, and maximize their cost effectiveness when approaching the right customers, extracting the real value from financial data.
Indeed, many of these new app based solutions and FinTech disruptors are still using their venture capital fund and many do not have any capital of their own, meaning that the valuations which currently appear very high are elevated by the influx of seed investment, thus the true staying power of all of these entities will be evident once they have to survive on their own revenues.
However, it is important to note that there are now dedicated solutions for financial services firms to connect to a well-funded solution that is operated by teams of programmers and analysts rather than one-man-band chancers, many of whom have been lead marketers in previous jobs, who will sit in your office for tens of thousands per month promising to turn your client database around whilst doing nothing of the sort.
Perhaps the FX industry’s larger, more well capitalized companies should look at this direction and actually begin to establish in-house departments of software engineers and database administrators who can emulate the service provided by Tink and some of the other firms, this way they reduce their marketing costs, keep clients longer, provide more aligned services to customers as they know their behavior, and not expose themselves to external ne’erdowells.
Wednesday: AFX black hole is concentrated largely in Cyprus
As pariah FX brokerage AFX Group finally shuffles off the financial coil, I was contacted by many respected colleagues here in London on Wednesday who had effectively seen the extent of the damage done by the profit sharing antics of AFX Group.
Yes, AFX’s management tried to cover it up and when I was the first to expose this house of cards two years ago, the phone line was red hot with attempts from those with a vested interest to attempt to silence the detailed research conducted by FinanceFeeds.
We have really gone into detail on this so I won’t labor the point here, however I do think it is important that all retail brokers have this information and take it on board so that they always make sure they are dealing with a proper prime of prime brokerage when looking for a liquidity partner.
There are only a very small number of genuine prime of prime brokerages with actual liquidity facilities provided via Tier 1 banks, those being INVAST Global, IS Prime, Saxo Bank, Swissquote, Advanced Markets, and CFH.
Aside from these top tier companies, there are some firms that sell liquidity but really it is not market liquidity, it is their own channel on their own dealing desk to provide execution facilities to retail brokers. It is not always bad of course, but it is almost impossible for a retail broker to figure out the method by which non-prime of primes operate their capital and if profit sharing is involved.
There is also a fair bit of incentivization being offered to brokers by b-book ‘liquidity’ providers in non-aligned jurisdictions with no financial markets infrastructure such as the Middle East and parts of South East Asia. My advice is, if a brown envelope is offered to your brokerage if you sign up with a firm for ‘liquidity’, go elsewhere.
I know that AFX Group has left a $50 million hole, which is the biggest assault on the sensibilities of the retail FX industry since the Fortress Prime scandal a few years ago, however on Wednesday I discovered that in AFX Group’s home country of Cyprus, that is where the majority of damage was done.
$28 million worth, to be exact.
Friday: Lots of furore in Australia, but many brokers take the sensible route
Australia is a very sensible place indeed.
So much common sense exists in the Antipodean former British colony that life is very comfortable, everything works without a modicum of drama, and it sits almost always at the top end of statistical reports detailing the nations with the highest quality of life.
Effectively, since 150 years ago when the British forced indentured labor on able-bodied men who faced poverty in their home nations of Scotland and Ireland by commandeering them onto a ship, relocating them literally half way around the world and then making them work the term of their certificates in a regimented and somewhat harsh fashion, Australia has been built and refined into a regulation-orientated, law abiding and highly efficient nation.
This level of work ethic has been applied to every aspect of Sydney and Melbourne’s modern business sector, financial services being no exception.
Australian FX brokers are in most cases operated by very astute professionals who dot the Is and cross the Ts of everything they do, and the regulatory authority ASIC, with its electronic surveillance system for compliance and its detailed understanding of the technological topography of the FX world is quite a combination of prowess.
This week’s inevitable proposal by ASIC to restrict the way that CFDs are sold, however, was considered a blow and a negative effort by the regulator and I spoke to many industry professionals who also thought that this would be detrimental. Some firms have already taken a totally retrograde step of going offshore, which as I said this week, is the wrong thing to do.
Others, however, have absolutely taken this seriously and according to many voices in Australia are cautiously welcoming the new regulations.
“We expect ASIC to use its new powers to address some of the concerns it has identified in the industry,” says Kevin Algeo, CEO of CFD provider IG Markets Australia. “IG Markets fully supports initiatives that are designed to strengthen client outcomes. We continue to be in close and regular contact with ASIC, supporting its efforts to introduce robust and proportionate regulation in the margin FX and CFD sector.
“We agree that for retail clients, leverage at 400:1 or more is excessive and needs to be addressed. We fully support ASIC in this approach and believe robust and proportionate regulation that strengthens client outcomes is in everyone’s best interest.”
Adam Smith, CEO of online trading house Saxo Capital Markets Australia, supports ASIC’s position. “We welcome a review of the leverage levels currently offered to investors and traders through CFDs and margin FX products. Leverage caps deliver better outcomes for clients, provide them with better protection and bring Australia into line with the rest of the world.”
This has to be admired, especially on IG Group’s part, which under the leadership of previous group CEO Peter Hetherington in London, worked with the FCA in Britain and ESMA in Europe to consult with the regulators when they decided to have a go at CFD advertising, leverage and provision methods, the upshot of which was lowered revenues for many large FX and CFD firms in the UK.
By working with ASIC and keeping their prestigious foothold in Australia, long term sustainability will be the eventual outcome.
Tamas Szabo, CEO of extremely successful electronic trading firm Pepperstone, has said that the CFD sector has already introduced a range of measures to ensure clients trade safely and it is prepared to make further changes to support this. “It is important to understand these products have been around in their current form in Australia for 17 years; they are not new.”
Mr Szabo has concerns about ASIC’s new powers. “It is unclear how ASIC’s product intervention powers are the appropriate approach when the power is meant to be one of temporary last resort.”
These are the companies that will do well long term, and as I said last week, it only takes a look at Japan’s leverage restriction some 7 years ago, which had absolutely no effect on brokerages other than clients putting in more margin capital before carrying on as normal.
On the other hand, I was approached on Friday by an industry participant who does not agree that eschewing the quality and structure of Australia for the oblivion that is an offshore island is the wrong way to do things as I categorically inferred last week.
“I disagree with the you on a number of fronts” said this particular commentator.
“Firstly, I disagree that any of the big name brokerage firms can have a sustainable business with a local audience especially with low population center locations. The margins in this business are decent but not enough to be sustained with a massive reduction in trading volume. Add a 20 to 1 leverage and the infrastructure likely will have a tough time with both less clients and less volume per client. Note the publicly held brokers in the EU have reported 60 percent reductions in revenue and this is with far more liberal conditions than what has been proposed by ASIC” he said.
“Additionally, the regulatory body is treating the symptoms not the illness. Note ASIC asserts that there have been more complaints this year than in previous years. This was largely attributable to the flash crash of January 3 and the mini crash on the GBP USD a few months earlier. This type of crash can be minimised by circuit breaker regulatory framework that has been used in equities” he continued.
“Lastly, according to the latest data the EU regulations that went into effect have not changed the amount of people losing money in trading so while you make a case for staying with the current regulatory framework none of the synergies you discuss such as ancillary products has any proof that it currently works or that it has a prospect of working.”
“You can take a look at the USA marketplace and not one broker has internationally recognized low cost of trading or the ancillary services he believes will occur. In fact the opposite has occured, more churning of clients, hit and miss profitability and no improvement on the ability for the clients to be successful” he said.
I am not so sure about that. Look at Interactive Brokers. They keep well over the capital required to satisfy the NFA’s regulatory requirements and are continually going from strength to strength with loyal customers who will simply not go anywhere else. The antithesis of churning and unsustainability.
Island life is simply not the way to go. Unless it is one of the new residential islands in the Thames next to Canary Wharf, or the aforementioned large island continent in the Antipodes.
Wishing you all a super week ahead!

Story 120
Those who closely followed the recent trial of Patrick Quirke, who was convicted last month of the murder of part-time DJ Bobby Ryan in a love-rival case that gripped the nation, may recall evidence of the Tipperary dairy farmer’s apparent successful foray into exotic financial derivatives.
Quirke told gardaí during the investigation that Mary Lowry, the object of both men’s affections, had given him €80,000 at one stage to invest in contracts for difference (CFDs). The punt delivered a €40,000 return for each of them over 18 months as part of a profit-share agreement, the trial heard.
They would have been rare cases.
Assets
CFDs are financial instruments that allow investors to bet on the price of assets, including shares, currencies and commodities moving up or down – without owning the assets – by putting up a small initial deposit, or margin. An initial outlay on a share-based CFD would typically have been in the region of 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the stock’s value, with the rest effectively borrowed from the brokerage offering the product.
Like buying a house with a 10 per cent deposit, a 10 per cent move in the value of the asset would result in a 100 per cent profit for the investor.
However, the power of leverage can be a destructive force when a bet goes awry. Investors face calls from their broker to deposit more cash in the CFD accounts to cover any losses if a wager starts to go against them, in what are known in the business as margin calls.
The Central Bank moved this week to invoke new powers it secured last year to restrict the sale of CFDs
The Central Bank published research in 2015 which found that three-quarters of small, or retail, investors who made CFD investments over the previous two years had lost money – averaging almost €7,000. A follow-up survey covering 2015 and 2016 showed a similar loss rate, though the average amount was lower, at €2,700.
The Central Bank moved this week to invoke new powers it secured last year to restrict the sale of CFDs and their close relatives, spread bets, to retail investors as soon as temporary limits imposed last year by European regulators run out. That’s currently scheduled for next month.
The bank ordered an outright ban on the marketing of another instrument, called binary options, which it considers a “fundamentally flawed product” that allows people to speculate on short-term price movements of an asset.
“They are no more an investment than betting on a horse,” said Derville Rowland, director-general of financial conduct at the Central Bank, in the announcement on Wednesday.
Leverage
On CFDs, Rowland said that based on the work “at a domestic and EU level, we have concluded that retail investors must be protected from excessive levels of leverage, which can result in unexpected high levels of losses”.
The restrictions include leverage limits and a requirement that retail investors cannot lose more money than they put into their CFD account. They also ban the use of incentives to lure small investors to get involved in CFDs, and place an obligation on brokers to warn clients on the risk of these instruments.
The leverage limits will be along the lines of temporary pan-European caps introduced last year, according to a spokesman for the Central Bank. This means, for example, that investors have to put down at least a 20 per cent deposit on a stock bet and a 10 per cent against most commodities.
While speculators can get away with as little as a 3.3 per cent initial margin on most major foreign exchange pairs, such as euro versus sterling, they must put 50 per cent upfront to wager on cryptocurrencies. The Central Bank had seen cases where small investors with minimal experience of trading CFDs were being offered a 400:1 leverage ratio before the European restrictions were introduced. That’s the equivalent of a €50,000 bet funded with an initial margin payment of €125.
The Quinns lost €3.2 billion investing in Anglo Irish Bank between 2007 and 2008, almost entirely through CFDs
The restrictions, however, have come more than a decade too late – and, arguably, do not go far enough.
The Central Bank of Ireland, more than any other financial supervisor, knows first-hand how dangerous CFDs are in the wrong hands, having being caught up in a saga surrounding the family of businessman Seán Quinn’s ill-fated bet on Anglo Irish Bank before the financial crash.
Loans
The Quinns lost €3.2 billion investing in Anglo Irish Bank between 2007 and 2008, almost entirely through CFDs. Regulators knew in 2008, as Anglo’s shares were plummeting, that the bank, rattled by the size of the Quinn shareholding, was planning to provide loans to the Quinns to convert most of the derivatives into shares.
The Central Bank also effectively gave Anglo the green light to lend €450 million to a group of 10 clients – known as the Maple 10 – to soak up the remainder of the shares underlying the CFDs. The transactions resulted in the convictions of three of the lender’s then top managers, including chief executive David Drumm.
The regulator only started a consultation in 2017 on the protection of small CFD investors. It held off on taking action as the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) slapped down its own temporary restrictions 12 months ago. It should have acted much sooner – and gone further.
CFDs have their place. They offer market players such as hedge funds a chance to bet that a stock or other asset will fall in price – a mechanism known as short selling. This improves market efficiency, allows for alternative views, and can even play a valuable role in preventing price bubbles forming.
But they’re best left to professional investors.

The company is seeking support for its 457MW Viking project on Shetland in the third CfD round
SSE leads the pack of remote islands wind developers seeking a Contract for Difference in the UK's upcoming third allocation round with its 457MW Viking project on Shetland.
The company confirmed to reNEWS that it will enter the 103-turbine project with tips heights of 155 metres into the auction, which kicks off on 29 May.
Other remote islands schemes to be put forward include EDF Renewables/Wood Group’s 180MW Stornoway on the Western Isles, Hoolan Energy’s combined 37MW Costa Head/Hesta Head duo on Orkney, as well as others.
Analysts said remote islands projects could compete with offshore wind due to high wind speeds and the falling cost of onshore turbines, but grid connections add a layer of cost and uncertainty.
“It could be cost-competitive but it is also very new with different risks around grid we haven’t seen before in CfD auctions,” said Cornwall Insight chief executive Gareth Miller.
Winning CfD3 bids are expected to be in the £47-53 per megawatt-hour range, he added.
“Any technology needs to bid below £56/MWh for 2023-24 delivery year or £53/MWh (for 2024-25 delivery year) because offshore wind is going to be below that and there’s more offshore wind that can bid than the 6GW (total allocation) cap,” he added.
“There’s potentially over 8GW or more that could bid in, which gives an extra competitive dynamic for other technologies trying to beat this.”
Other technologies eligible for the auction include tidal, wave, geothermal and fuelled technologies such as anaerobic digestion and biomass with CHP.
Simec Atlantis confirmed to reNEWS that it will place a bid to secure a CfD for its 80MW MeyGen Phase 1C tidal array in the Pentland Firth.
“We’re going to put in a very competitive but realistic bid,” said chief executive Tim Cornelius.
“We acknowledge it could be difficult (to win a CfD) but, that said, there is an opportunity to fit in (under the 6GW cap) as we are only 80MW, the auction mechanics could help us,” he added.
Miller said small projects could squeeze in under the 6GW cap with a competitive bid.
“You could get a situation where some offshore wind doesn’t bid as expected and a small project at a higher strike price gets accepted, although this very dependent on other technologies being cheap enough to compete,” he added.

The AFM plans to publish the new rules in April 2019.
The number of European countries which are seeking to implement the product intervention measures introduced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) at a national level is growing. The ESMA measures, as FinanceFeeds’ readers probably know, impose a ban on the offering of binary options to retail investors, as well as restrictions on the offering of CFDs to retail investors. Whereas ESMA’s restrictions are temporary, a number of European countries are looking into implementing these rules on a permanent basis.
The latest addition to the this group of countries is the Netherlands, as the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) has unveiled its plans to ban binary options and to introduce restrictions to the offering of CFDs to retail investors in line with ESMA’s rules. These, however, will not be temporary but will last permanently.
AFM’s investigation has shown that there is a significant reason for concern about investor protection. The regulator therefore intends to take measures with regard to the aforementioned products.
The AFM is expected to publish the measures in April 2019.
Germany and the UK have acted in the same manner regarding ESMA’s rules. The FCA’s proposed interventions are the same in substance as ESMA’s, although the UK regulator is also proposing to apply its rules to closely substitutable products, including so-called turbo certificates. The regulator is also envisaging 30:1 leverage limits for CFDs referencing certain government bonds (compared to 5:1 under ESMA’s measures).

The dynamic between grip and drag dictates design preparation for each race over the Formula One calendar.
“Good grip enables the car to go faster but downforce also produces drag, which must be overcome by engine power,” says Peter Machin, head of aerodynamics at Renault Sport Formula One Team. “The ultimate goal is to generate a vertical force and push the tires into the ground while minimizing drag.”

The workflow of a Formula One car design is a 365-day-a-year process. Throughout the season, surfaces are continually being adjusted to accommodate the track, the driver and climate conditions.
“Our car could be seen as an aerospace prototype,” says Luca Mazzocco, head of technological partnerships, Renault Sport Formula One Team. “We need to deploy innovation race-by-race if we want to be a credible challenger, and that can be on a weekly basis and on 21 different tracks around the globe.”
Seventy percent of a car’s performance stems directly from its aerodynamic behavior.
Incremental improvements are made on day-to-day basis as stiffness, weight and cost effectiveness are balanced. Not surprisingly, aerodynamics is the largest department at Renault Sport Formula One Team; it commands the biggest budget and its supercomputer produces 60TB of data each week.
Aerodynamics involves both physical testing and simulation. Aside from the inherent limitations of a wind tunnel, the nature and extent of physical testing is restricted by Formula One regulations. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software is critical and, for more than 15 years, the company has been using Simcenter STAR-CCM+ software from Siemens.
As the use of strong, lightweight carbon fiber is critical to a racing car’s aerodynamic performance, Renault Sport Formula One Team also uses the Fibersim portfolio of software for composites engineering from Siemens PLM Software. This is used to manage the design, analysis and manufacture of fiber-reinforced composite parts.
Paul Cusdin, head of CFD for Renault Sport Formula One Team, says, “Our challenge is to ensure that the computational domain correlates with data captured from the wind tunnel, so we can ensure that every design upgrade will actually match up with reality.”
The focus is not only on speed; CFD is used for thermal simulation because an overheated car is a potential danger and must be called into the pits. On the other hand, there are clear restrictions on how much cooling can be applied to the engine during a race.
CFD is also used to simulate the action on the track, particularly when another vehicle directly in front is creating turbulence that not only makes it difficult to overtake it but could lead to a critical loss of downforce in one part of the car.
Another major question for the CFD experts at Renault Sport Formula One Team is how to get the most from the tires. It is not easy to model the geometry and wake behavior of tires in a wind tunnel, especially in high-speed corners when tire shape fluctuates. Another consideration is that within a tunnel, wind moves over the car rather than the car moving over ground.
“This area is where we have the least correlation between the physical and the computational,” says Cusdin. “Yet we need to extract more from the tires, for example, by placing geometry around the floor of the car in the best way possible for aerodynamics performance.”
CFD offers a design team insight into what happens in the wind tunnel.
“It shows the precise airflow over the car and tells us why we are getting certain results,” says Cusdin. “For example, simulation shows whether a vortex is above the wing or below it. It can introduce heat, which we cannot do in the wind tunnel, and illustrate thermal interaction. It tells us more about a specific design, indicating if it is close to optimal. In short, the computational domain not only augments the physical domain, it also improves it.”
In one instance, members of the CFD team were looking to incorporate the power of the fast-moving air from the exhaust to enhance downforce, but results on the track were disappointing.
By further analyzing the physics, they discovered that modeling the exhaust as a steady jet rather than a series of pulses had inadvertently led Renault Sport Formula One Team designers down the wrong path. CFD solved this engineering challenge by simulating the pulse aspect and allowing engineers to visualize its repercussions on the airflow.
“When we test different geometries in the wind tunnel, we learn whether they are better or worse than the prior design, but we only rarely understand exactly why,” says Cusdin. “Understanding the vortex created by the front wing is particularly important because the rest of the car depends on that; yet CFD has been rather poor at capturing the wake structure at the front of the car.
“However, Siemens PLM Software introduced a turbulence model within the latest enhancements for Simcenter STAR-CCM+ and now we can look at all the vortices shed off the front, side and rear and clearly see how these react with the field downstream.”
The CFD team aims to calculate and recalculate design changes within a few hours so that clear information is available for designers.
“Our simulation pipeline is very simple,” says Cusdin. “Other CFD software requires extensive coding, but we only write code for each new set of environmental parameters. This is the unique advantage of Simcenter STAR-CCM+ and it means that we can create templates for the design team.”
As a result, design engineers can replace any surface and continuously re-run the same simulation. By accessing templates from within the system, they do not even have to open Simcenter STAR-CCM+ or see the solver. In this way, the CFD team iterates in step with the design department as aerodynamic shapes are assessed for performance.
Promising geometries are sent to the wind tunnel and reassessed through CFD. Designs are released for manufacture only when results from the wind tunnel match those from simulation. In accordance with Formula One regulations, the wind tunnel car is a 60% scale model.
Because of the fast testing cycle and shape complexity, most wind tunnel model parts are made using additive manufacturing, a technology that is also involved in making several full-scale car parts. In some cases, this process can be completed overnight, though more complex parts may take several weeks.

Ducati’s MotoGP team have ramped up their use of fluid dynamics to make aerodynamic strides despite a tightening of the aero rules for this season.
The firm’s aero manager Edoardo Lenoci spoke at length during the team launch in Switzerland, outlining what he hopes to achieve.
“We introduced massive use of CFD, Computational Fluid Dynamics, which means the mathematical simulation of what happens around the bike in terms of aerodynamics,” said Lenoci.
“In the past we used to develop bikes in the wind tunnel, so we used a full-scale model, made up of actual existing components, spare parts from existing bikes for example.
“By using the CFD, there are a couple of advantages, for example I can tell you on one side the huge amount of data coming out of simulations helps the engineers to understand with deep knowledge what happens on the bike in terms of aerodynamics.
“Because in the wind tunnel you cannot see pressure distribution or streamlines or stress distributions on the surface of the bike. While you have this in CFD. So when you go in the wind tunnel you just do optimisation work, which is as important as developing new concepts.
“On the other side you don’t have to wait for existing parts to be mounted on the bike as a model, so you can start your development earlier than before.”

From July 1, 2019, all new AFCA decisions will include the names of the financial firms involved.
In a move set to boost transparency and accountability to the public, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) will soon put an end to the practice of publishing decisions about financial firms in an anonymised way. The change was announced in the latest Newsletter of the dispute resolution scheme published earlier today.
AFCA already publishes regular updates on its statistics and all its decisions. This is currently in an anonymised way. However, from July 1, 2019, after AFCA has amended its Rules, all new decisions will include the names of the financial firms involved.
In addition, the body will publish detailed six-monthly reports on its work, the definite systemic issues it is identifying and the firms involved, and comparative tables of the complaints accepted and resolved by financial firms.
AFCA is currently investigating 42 definite systemic issues. The scheme has also identified 11 potential serious contraventions and other breaches.
An interesting case study concerning a CFD broker (an unnamed one) is mentioned in the latest newsletter.
AFCA says it received complaints from clients who opened Forex trading accounts with a financial firm and started trading over-the-counter contracts for difference. As this type of trade is highly complex and risky, ASIC requires a high standard of disclosure is made to investors and for all prospective clients to meet several benchmarks – including minimum qualification requirements – before an account can be opened. The complaints centred around inappropriate investment advice from the financial firm, but all complainants were found to lack investment trading experience. The Systemic Issues team investigated whether the financial firm was applying the client qualification benchmarks appropriately.
It was found that the financial firm had a phone script that was read to prospective clients just prior to their online assessment for suitability to trade. The script provided information to assist the customers in responding to the questions. The online assessment additionally gave access to ‘more information’ via a button, to help clients during the test.
AFCA found the proximity of the phone script to the online assessment and the additional assistance provided by a ‘more information’ button to be akin to ‘coaching’. The financial firm removed their phone script and amended the client qualification assessment to increase difficulty.

Next Generation of Z-Tech Tugs Arrive
Mark E. Kuebler
By The Maritime Executive 2019-02-10 00:00:13
At the end of 2018, Gulf Island Shipyards completed the first of ten Z-Tech® 30-80 tugs, five of which were ordered by Bay Houston Towing Company through its operator G & H Towing Company in Galveston, Texas.
The Z-Tech® 30-80 tug Mark E. Kuebler evolved from the previous Z-Tech® 7500 design for the same owner. Once again, the design team and client worked seamlessly addressing operational challenges the vessel will face. A main feature of this latest Z-Tech® is incorporating Robert Allan Ltd.’s unique RAstar series sponsoned hull form into the existing Z-Tech design.
Computer simulations conducted by Robert Allan Ltd.’s in house CFD team demonstrate escort performance of the new tug will be significantly increased by generating more than 100 mt steering force at 10 knots which is particularly important for escorting large vessels.
Particulars of Mark E. Kuebler are:
Length Overall: 98’-6”
Beam, moulded: 42’-8”
Depth, moulded: 16’-5”
Gross Tonnage:
ITC: 411
US Regulatory: 297
The tugs were designed and constructed to comply with all applicable Rules and Regulations of:
ABS ?A1 Towing Service, ? AMS, Escort Service, Fire Fighting Vessel Class 1 and all applicable U.S. Coast Guard regulations
Tank capacities are as follows:
Fuel oil: 42620 GAL
Potable water: 6700 GAL
Sea trial results showed Mark E. Kuebler met all requirements to the design:
Bollard pull, ahead: 81.5 MT
Free running speed, ahead: 13 knots
Customized general layout of the tug represents more than a decade of cooperation by Robert Allan Ltd. naval architects and the owners. The Master and Chief Engineer’s cabin along with galley and mess are located on the main deck while two cabins for four crew members are located on the lower deck.
Main propulsion for the tug comprises a pair of Caterpillar 3516E, EPA Tier 4 certified diesel engines, each rated 3386 bHP at 1800 rpm, and driving a Schottel SRP 510FP Z-drive unit with Ø2800 propeller. The tug is fitted with a Fire Fighting 1 system with two FFS 6200 gpm pumps driven by two Caterpillar engine C18 respectively.
The electrical plant consists of two identical John Deere 6068AFM85 diesel gen-sets, each with a power output of 125 eKw 480V, 3-Ph, 60 Hz.
Ship-handling fenders at the bow consist of one tier of 36” OD x 18” ID cylindrical fender at the main deck level with 16” thick double loop soft fenders between the main deck and the knuckle at bow and along the sheer lines of main deck. 16” OD x 8” ID cylindrical fendering is used at the stern.

Story 136
CLEVELAND- The FOX 8 I-Team has obtained a letter written by a paramedic resigning from Cleveland EMS outlining a long list of serious problems with the ambulance service affecting workers and patients like you and your family.
Paramedic Megan Mull sent the letter to officials and city council members at Cleveland City Hall.
She wrote she had planned on a career with EMS, but she is leaving the job due to a “toxic and dangerous environment.”
In short, the letter cites too many calls for help handled by too few paramedics working forced overtime -- doing all of that while earning pay called “not close to competitive.”
In fact, Mull refers to city ambulances frequently taken out of service and unable to respond to calls due to short staffing.
The letter also cites “public embarrassment” with ambulance units breaking down while carrying patients.
And the letter raises a safety concern with paramedics in Cleveland sent to crimes in progress even before police get there.
The I-Team has reported on many of these problems before investigating staffing, and response times, condition of equipment and much more.
Mull ended her letter by writing, “I want to make it clear and known that I am not leaving CEMS for another job. I will miss this career, the citizens, and my coworkers deeply.”
The I-Team reached out to city hall for comment over two days. The only response we received was silence. City spokespeople did not respond at all to our inquiries about this.
You can read the full letter, below:
To Whom It May Concern,
I regret to inform you of my departure from Cleveland EMS (CEMS). Despite having completed paramedic school with the plan of a full career at CEMS, I no longer have any reason to believe this is a healthy long term environment. I have cared for and learned from my coworkers and patients here, and I will value those experiences forever. I find being an urban medic rewarding, exhilarating, and exhausting. Regrettably, the combination of low compensation, high stress, and poor management practices have forced me to make an unwanted departure.
In departure paperwork requested to be completed, I was given two lines to explain why I am leaving employment with CEMS, and to do so with such limited space would be both inaccurate and incomplete.
1. Working Conditions
- CEMS handles the most calls with the smallest ratio of employees of any surrounding EMS department, but lacks standard equipment to make our jobs safer and less physically demanding. One solution would be autoloaders (equipment most cities squads have to lift the cot safely into/out of the ambulance) or Lucas’ devices (machines that perform consistent, high quality CPR and improve patient outcomes). Equipment other departments consider standard.
- My assigned unit had no air conditioning in the front cab for weeks during June 2019 with temperature in the 90’s. CEMS employees are required to wear law enforcement styled ballistic vests in every situation other than at base or hospitals. Wearing a ballistic vest while in an ambulance, during a 90 degree or hotter day, with no front AC, is unsafe. The heavy material meant to protect the body becomes a threat as body temperatures rise. When reporting to upper management about broken equipment, CEMS was told that front cab AC would be fixed during annual maintenance, and it was not a requirement. Medic 17 was told the same. Air conditioning in the rear compartment is considered a priority for patient care.
- Medic 6’s EMS room has not had AC or a refrigerator/freezer since early July, which has been repeatedly reported.
- Constantly wearing ballistic vests also causes health problems for many employees, including myself, who has seen a chiropractor repeatedly to put my ribs back into place. Please see attached note from Dr. Massey.
- August 3, 2019 (run number E1907141), CEMS 6 was dispatched to male beating a female with a stick at an approximate intersection from a passerby. While staging for CPD, I was told Medic 6, my assigned unit, was not staging close enough to the scene. CPD was not yet dispatched. The call was located on a busy bus line where parties could rapidly move, and the only EMS guideline is a verbal direction of staging at paramedic discretion. The fact that CEMS is on scene staging before CPD is dispatched for assaults in progress is dangerous, well documented, and inappropriate for medical personnel.
- CEMS still sends ambulances to 911 hang ups, an unheard of and dangerous practice for medical professionals. In other major cities, police investigate these calls and call for a squad if a medical emergency is found.
2. Low Compensation for Extremely High Responsibility
- Untrained city employees receive $15 an hour pay, but state certified CEMS paramedics start at $17.49, and with 2 years’ experience make $19.81. These pay rates are from 2015, as the awarded arbitration has not yet been implemented, although completed nearly one year ago. To be eligible for full retirement, CEMS employees must perform these tasks for 32 years, with little room for advancement. This job involves responsibility over dangerous drugs, operating specialized equipment, years of schooling, pronouncing death, restoring pulses, specialized cardiac care, intubation, navigating the city while driving a large vehicle in unpredictable traffic and inclement weather, significant lifting of patients and equipment, caring for abused and critical children, and informing families their loved one is dead. There is no training that can prepare you for a critical patient begging you not to let them die. The pay is not close to competitive, when combined with work environment as cited above, and management issues listed below. With a higher per unit call volume than even New Orleans EMS it is no surprise our medics are tired, disillusioned and burnt out. Unsafe or not, if we refuse a mandate (an additional 6 hours) leading to an 18 hour shift with all these responsibilities, then on our day off we are required to attend a Pre Disciplinary Hearing where we are questioned and pressured to accept them in the future.
3. Constantly Training New Employees, or CFD
- On my last full arrest CFD First Responders were unable to ventilate our patient, or complete basic medical skills besides CPR. First responders have also informed me on other occasions they are unable to apply defibrillation pads, set up an IV bag, or turn on the sirens. This is a frequent problem and CEMS is running full codes while managing better compensated staff. With our extremely high turnover rate, paramedics also routinely find themselves with inexperienced partners who also must be assisted navigating, performing medical skills and guided through patient treatment. In many other fields this would be recognized with a pay gap, or hourly sum for supervision responsibility. At CEMS, your support staff is luck of the draw.
4. Public Embarrassment
- CEMS routinely has to apologize for the state of their vehicles, including when they break down with patients inside. On Nov 6, 2018 at Public Square, my previous unit Medic 28(which has over 370,00 miles and a bullet indentation) had the back door break, as had happened dozens of times, with a woman in active labor and was profusely apologizing to irate family that another unit, Medic 20 had to be called from base. As you may have seen on the news, another unit experienced nightmarish conditions when their spare unit broke down on the scene of a cardiac arrest. This crew was not recognized for an amazing performance under horrible conditions for getting the patient’s heart beating again.
- When these events make the news, the commissioner has chosen to state it may be operator error. In fact, it was left out of the public statement about the cardiac arrest that truck was towed, and that staff attempting to drive the vehicle had decades of experience. Additionally, the commissioner erred in citing the wrong ambulance details, as they were in a spare with many more miles and issues, which had been put back in rotation within 2 weeks.
- The commissioner’s opposition to providing equal PTSD coverage for CEMS as CFD and CPD receive is truly alarming. It is unconscionable that the CEMS employees who care for victims of events that headline news around the country, handling families of victims with care and compassion, and themselves documenting the darkest details of human behavior do not receive the benefits provided by the city to so many others.
Our field medics “do the most with the least”, as is often quoted by surrounding departments, but our own management doesn’t seem to feel that way. I can assure you employees will continue to leave a career they love for better management, better compensation, or a less stressful work environment. I regret to write to you in such circumstances, but I truly believe this is a toxic and dangerous environment for many people I care about. Too often, and most of my last shifts, units are being shut down at 1 pm due to lack of staff. Thousands of residents depend on a system that is being run into the ground, with good employees being driven away, forced to choose between their health and career. I want to make it clear and known that I am not leaving CEMS for another job.
I will miss this career, the citizens, and my coworkers deeply.
Sincerely,
Paramedic #1703

What is a ‘hedge’? Simply put, it is a trade, or an investment, designed to mitigate risk. Therefore, ‘hedging’ is a process of reducing the risk by means of investments.
Hedging explained
Considering the wild ride traders faced in 2018 due to extreme market volatility, many are searching for effective hedging strategies to reduce risk and keep their finances safe.
So, what hedging techniques can the average trader employ without overcomplicating their trading strategy, while managing their trading budget?
All in all, hedging is an effective risk management tool, used by traders and investors to protect their funds against adverse market movements. It can be compared to insurance: you won’t prevent an incident from happening with a hedge, but hedging will limit the amount of damage done, if and when it actually happens.
Why do we hedge?
Hedging usually takes the form of holding several positions at the same time with the aim to offset any losses from the one trade with the profits from the other.
When you hedge, you do not think of generating profit, but try to find a proper way to minimise your loss. Actually, there is no a perfect means to prevent the market’s unfavorable movement against you, but a successful hedging strategy may significantly reduce your losses.
You should also carefully consider how much money you have available for hedging, as you need additional capital to place additional (hedging) trades. There is no singular answer to the question “How much should I hedge?”, because every trader has a different risk tolerance and funds available.
Why do we use CFDs for hedging?
Hedging can be performed through various financial instruments, however, derivatives, such as Contracts for Difference (CFDs), remain one of the most popular hedging tools among investors and traders alike.
CFDs are very flexible
Choosing contracts for difference, you can go long or short, and hedge yourself against any risk, regardless of the market’s direction
CFDs require small initial deposits
CFDs are leveraged products, meaning that you have to deposit only a small part of money to place a trade, the rest will be covered by your CFD broker.
Unlimited access to different markets
Ultimate CFD trading platforms offer you an extended range of different markets available to trade. You can choose from a great variety of commodities, indices, stocks, currencies and cryptocurrencies, and will have no trouble finding a hedge.
Top 3 popular CFD hedging strategies
Foreign exchange hedging
Many traders used to hold shares in the European and American markets. However, what happens if the CAD or AUD strengthen? It may be a good hedging strategy to use foreign exchange CFDs to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on your portfolio.

Commodities hedging
Commodities have always served as effective hedging instruments. The thing is, the intrinsic value of commodities is independent from currencies. Even when a particular currency falls during a period of inflation, commodities often hold their value.
Let’s assume you hold shares in some of the world’s largest mining companies. You consider them a great long-term investment, however, you’re a bit nervous about short-term price drops. In order to hedge your investment, you can short-sell gold, oil or iron CFDs to constraint this short-term effect on your portfolio.

Stock market hedging
Well, imagine you own shares in a range of international companies. You believe they are good investments in a long perspective. However, the stock markets may be extremely volatile and you want to protect your capital. CFDs on indices are just what you need. Shorting CFDs on a particular index should be an effective hedging strategy against short-term stock market fluctuations.

In the financial world, hedging is an effective risk management strategy.
However, to hedge with any success, you will need to elaborate and develop your own hedging strategy that will help you to minimize your exposure to the risk of uncertainty and significantly restrict your losses.

The pan-EU regulator finds that the proposed measures are justified and proportionate.
As FinanceFeeds has reported, a number of European countries have acted to implement investor protection measures analogical to those introduced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) with regards to the offering of CFDs and binary options to retail clients.
Among the goals of such measures is to protect investors at a national level, once the temporary measures introduced by ESMA expire and the EU regulator stops renewing them.
Earlier today, ESMA published its positive opinion on the national product intervention measures introduced by three countries – Poland, the UK and the Netherlands.
ESMA’s opinion finds that the proposed measures are justified and proportionate and that it is necessary for national regulators to take product intervention measures that are at least as stringent as ESMA’s measures.
ESMA’s has issued opinions on national product intervention measures from:
Authority for the Financial Markets of the Netherlands (AFM) – Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options;
Authority for the Financial Markets of the Netherlands (AFM) – Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences;
Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego of Poland (KNF) – Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options; and
Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (FCA) – Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options.
The UK ban on binary options comes into effect today. Importantly, it is also applying to so-called ‘securitised binary options’ that were excluded from ESMA’s prohibition. Securitised binary options are not currently sold in or from the UK. The FCA thinks these products pose the same risks for investors and so is extending the scope of the prohibition to prevent a market developing for these products.
The FCA estimates the permanent ban on binary options could save retail consumers up to £17 million per year, and may reduce the risk of fraud by unauthorised entities claiming to offer these products.
In its opinion about the UK measures, ESMA says it has assessed the relevance of the FCA’s supervisory experience, in particular the likelihood of circumvention of the exclusion by UK product providers, as well as the particular position of UK clients which historically traded binary options as gambling products and have experienced significant losses. ESMA considers that the specificities of the national market together with the inherent complexity of the product justifies a stricter treatment in the national measure.

Financial engineering has created many exotic instruments for generating superior returns with minimal risk. A contract for difference (CFD) is one example. You can speculate on the future price moves of assets, such as stocks, indices, forex, bonds, cryptocurrencies and commodities if you find the best CFD broker for you.
Quick Look: Best CFD Brokers
What’s Contract for Differences Trading?
A CFD is a contract executed between two parties, a buyer and a seller, which means that the seller pays the buyer the difference between the current value of an asset and its value when the contract is due.

There isn’t any physical exchange of assets (which could be a physical share, currency pair or commodity) between the buyer and the seller, and neither party can claim physical ownership of the asset.

CFD trading is illegal in the U.S., although European brokers allow CFD trading in U.S. assets.

Make Decisions and Trade
To trade CFDs, first decide on which underlying asset you want to trade. CFD instruments could be shares, treasuries, currency pairs, commodities and stock indices such as the U.K. 100, which aggregates the price movements of all the stocks listed on the FTSE 100.

Then, open a position and then enter details such as whether you want to buy or sell the CFD, the amount intended for investment, leverage and other considerations.

Leverage is available for a margin account. Leverage refers to a loan extended by a broker, and the securities and cash in your trading account serve as collateral. It allows you to enter into a larger deal than what your account funding permits.

You and the CFD broker then enter into a contractual agreement which covers details such as the opening price for the position, fees involved, etc.
Determine Profit/Loss
If the position closes in a profit, the broker is liable to pay the trader. If it closes in a loss, the brokerage charges the trader the difference.

Assume you wish to go long on a CFD based on the shares of XYZ company, currently priced at $400, on the premise that the shares are undervalued and will likely go up. You now need to log into your brokerage account, which provides for CFD trading, and place an order for, say 100 XYZ CFD.

If the value of the shares rises by $10, in line with your expectations, you gain $1,000 (100 x $10). On the other hand, if the value falls by $10, you owe your broker $1,000.

Due to the leverage allowed, a trader needs to pay only $4,000 if the margin requirement is 10%. In the first case when you made the right bet. Your profit percent will be $1,000/$4,000 *100 = 25%.

In the second case, your loss percent will be $1,000/$4,000*100, which will be 25%. Meanwhile, if you had chosen to invest in the shares trading in a stock market, your loss percentage would have been 1,000/40,000*100, or 2.5%.
What to Look for in a CFD Broker
As you zero in on the right CFD broker, it’s important to consider a slew of factors, including regulation, costs, tradable asset classes and the trading platforms available.

Regulation
Regulation ensures the safety of your funds from internal company fraud or financial setbacks. Make sure the broker you’re considering is regulated by the regulatory agency of that particular location. For example, in the U.K., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the regulatory agency and in Australia, it is the Australian Securities Commission (ASC).
Cost of Trading
CFD trading involves costs such as spread, holding costs and commission and possibly more, depending on the broker you choose.

The spread is the difference between the buy and sell price. You enter a buy trade using the buy price quoted and exit using the sell price. The narrower the spread, the less the price needs to move in your favor before you start to make a profit, or if the price moves against you, a loss.
At the end of each trading day, positions open in your account may be subject to a charge called a holding cost, and you’ll also pay a separate commission charge when you trade CFDs.
Also, how complicated is it to deposit and withdraw funds? The more funding options your broker offers, the better.
Broad Tradable Asset Classes and Markets
Broad tradable asset classes and markets give you wider choice availability. Some underlying assets you can trade include stocks, indexes, commodities, currencies, cryptocurrencies and ETFs.
Easy-to-Use Platform
Look for a trading platform that offers intuitive trading software, fast execution, good trading tools and order management system. You may lose out on profits if the user interface is poor and navigation is difficult. The platform should be secure and also give you the flexibility to place different types of orders.

Final Thoughts
There’s no one-size-fits-all broker for traders with different experience levels, risk-return and asset class preferences. For starters, regulation could be a key issue, especially because derivative instruments such as CFDs are risky. Because of the volatility involved, a fairly decent trading platform and demo account are invaluable. It pays to do some research before you decide which CFD broker is best for you.




Story 141
As I write this, the World Series opener is only a few hours away. Two storied Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox, play in the fall classic. Both teams play in outdoor stadiums so there is always a chance that weather will be a factor. However, I decided to go beyond the standard story about how weather might affect the World Series. As an atmospheric scientist, I thought it would be interesting to explore the meteorology of actual baseballs in flight and the innovative capabilities of a new company called Weather Applied Metrics.
John Farley/WAM
To explore this topic, I had a conversation with John Farley, the Chief Technology Officer for Weather Applied Metrics (see this link for an information video). The company quantifies weather impacts on baseball (and sports in general) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, standard trajectory physics, and other meteorological analysis. According to Farley, the company has a team of six: two PhDs - one is a retired meteorology professor, one is a CFD engineer, one master's degree meteorologist, a college physics student, a CEO of a Silicon Valley Company, and a San Francisco Bay Area broadcast meteorologist. Farley reached out to me, and I was immediately fascinated. In my scholarly research, I study urban meteorological processes so was familiar with the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling (good tutorial at this link) to simulate flow around buildings or to track tracer flows for hazardous materials. There are many applications of CFDs, but I really never thought one would be at a baseball stadium. Weather Applied Metrics installed its Beta site at the Columbia Fireflies stadium. The Fireflies are the Single A Affiliate of the New York Mets in Columbia, South Carolina. Farley told me,
You may recall that Tim Tebow hit a home run in his first at bat with the Fireflies. That day the weather helped carry that ball by roughly 15-18 feet and it cleared the fence by a few feet. So without the weather, it would probably have been a warning track out. Last June we installed our technology in an MLB park and we are now in the final stages of completing an agreement with them for the 2019 season.
I was so fascinated by what this company was up to that I conducted a Q & A with Farley. Our conversation is summarized below.
Dr. Marshall Shepherd: How does weather affect baseball trajectory?
John Farley: If the wind is blowing hard, that's the most significant impact. A headwind, combined with a downdraft, can shorten a fly ball hit to the wall by as much as 60 feet. A tail wind, combined with an updraft can lengthen it by as much as 45 feet. Since baseballs absorb moisture from the air (they are hygroscopic), the difference in distance between very dry air and very wet air is roughly 50 feet. That's because a wet ball is slightly heavier and spongier, so it doesn't come off the bat as fast. On a hotter day the air is less dense and so a ball can travel as much as 30 feet farther, compared to a cold day. Air pressure affects density directly. So balls hit at high altitude travel considerably farther. In the graphic above, our analysis is an example of a cross wind over a major league stadium. With the resulting downdraft and headwind in right field, the ball’s flight is shortened by roughly 30 feet.
Dr. Marshall Shepherd: Can it significantly impact outcomes and is there a way of determining?
John Farley: Yes. Our real-time display at the Fireflies Stadium in Columbia, SC shows how much the weather is impacting the distance of an average fly ball hit to the outfield fence (averaging 375 feet). Blue numbers are feet added. Red numbers are feet subtracted. Here are a few examples from games. The arrow at home plate shows the prevailing wind. In this smaller stadium, the prevailing wind is very representative of the winds over the flight of the ball.
John Farley
Dr. Marshall Shepherd: How are you using Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Modeling to study baseball?
John Farley: CFD is necessary because the wind flow inside stadiums is very complex and often very different from what the flags show on top of the stadium. Additionally, what’s been missing from all of the baseball trajectory analysis that we’ve seen is vertical wind (as meteorologists that’s all we think about!). And there is a lot of vertical wind inside stadiums, which has a significant impact on the flight of the ball over its entire trajectory. Prevailing winds (see graphic below) blowing over a stadium in one direction, but the winds at field level doing the exact opposite, and there’s a lot going on in between. We model the wind field down to each square foot over the entire area where a ball could fly. Then we use those winds for our 3D-Trajectory model with increments of 0.001 seconds.
John Farley
Dr. Marshall Shepherd: Why are you doing this?
John Farley: We are weather and sports geeks and we are very curious! Why else would we do this? ;-) As meteorologists, we’ve always know that weather has a huge impact on sports. Now we can tell you exactly what’s going on with each ball.
Farley and colleagues may be on to something, but only time will tell. He provided me with a summary of how Weather Applied Metrics (WAM) illustrates the impact of weather on baseball. Data was collected for all home games for the Columbia South Carolina Fireflies for the 2016 Season. The bulk game statistics show some pretty compelling impacts on runs per game, earned runs per game, home runs per game, and hits per game.

Story 142
ASIC will consider whether breaching overseas law is consistent with obligations under Australian law to provide services ‘efficiently, honestly and fairly’.
Less than two months after the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) warned that some Australian financial service (AFS) licensees may be taking advantage of the latest regulatory developments and are abusing the scope of their AFS licenses, the regulator has once again voiced its concerns about regulatory arbitrage.
In a speech at the Australian Regulatory Summit 2019, Commissioner Cathie Armour today said there is a risk of such regulatory arbitrage in the retail OTC derivatives market.
The Commissioner noted that the retail OTC derivatives sector in Australia is an active and growing market with an annual turnover of $11 trillion and over 450,000 investors. The products offered by retail OTC derivatives issuers in Australia include binary options, margin foreign exchange and contracts for difference.
Last year, ASIC published results of a review that found client losses in retail OTC derivatives trades were high, with the percentage of unprofitable traders being up to 80% for binary options, 72% for CFD traders and 63% for margin FX traders.
Regulators in many jurisdictions – Europe, Japan, North America and China, have restricted or prohibited the provision to retail investors of certain OTC derivatives. As there are not similar restrictions in Australia, there is a risk of regulatory arbitrage.
In April this year, ASIC publicly warned Australian issuers that they may be dealing with overseas investors illegally and to cease any non-compliant activities immediately. There may be consequences overseas for potential breaches of overseas law, but in any event, ASIC will consider whether breaching overseas law is consistent with obligations under Australian law to provide services ‘efficiently, honestly and fairly’. ASIC is also concerned some AFS licensees may be making misleading or deceptive statements about the scope or application or effect of an AFS licence.
One of the companies that has already taken action in response to ASIC’s warnings is Hong Kong-focused retail FX broker KVB Kunlun. As a holder of the Australian Financial Services License, the Group received a letter from Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) dated April 18, 2019 addressed to its licensees. The Letter reminded licensees that they were obliged to comply with applicable laws of foreign jurisdictions, and recommended that licensees should seek legal advice to ensure that the products and services they offer to their clients comply with applicable foreign laws.
Certain subsidiaries of KVB Kunlun hold Australian and New Zealand financial services licenses, and the online forex margin trading platform of the Group’s Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries is targeted towards, among others, ethnic Chinese. A detailed survey of the Group’s Existing Ethnic Chinese Clients will be conducted. This survey aims to identify anyone who is, or who may possible be, classified as a PRC domestic client. Any person identified as an actual or potential PRC domestic client will then be disengaged as soon as possible.
In her speech today, Commissioner Cathie Armour said ASIC will continue to be active in the retail OTC derivatives sector.

Story 145
The FCA may be regarded as a force to be reckoned with by many electronic trading firms who have felt the wrath of its restrictive measures on CFDs, but now the FCA itself is the subject of record numbers of bullying and harassment complaints from its own staff.
Transparency and freedom of information are two very important key factors in business, and thankfully the major centers of the financial services industry are set within high quality environments with very low levels of corruption, good business ethics and government and regulatory efforts that continue to champion the cause of responsibility.
The US, UK and Australia are three major global centers, and are renowned for being among the most transparent, well run economies on the planet.
This is certainly a good thing, and by its nature, the public availability of information and requirement to disclose all areas of business applies not only to private business, but to the public sector too, including financial markets regulators.
Today, a rather unusual subject of derision is the internal culture at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain’s non-bank financial markets regulatory authority which oversees the commercial ethics of some of the largest electronic trading firms in the world.
Whilst it is clear that the FCA is a pragmatic regulator which operates in a genuine free market meritocracy where who plays golf with who holds no sway – the reinstatement of Plus500’s trading in 2015 after lobbying efforts from domestic giants is testimony to the adherence to due process – a freedom of information procedure which London’s Financial News claims that it used to obtain information has led to the exposure of 14 cases of complaints by employees at the FCA, accusing the regulator of bullying and harassment.
This may well be the age of the snowflake generation, however its the increase over last year’s figures that is of interest.
Figures obtained via a freedom of information request show employees brought 14 cases of bullying and harassment against the FCA last year, up from just four in 2017. All the incidents were investigated by the regulator, two people were fired and three were subject to disciplinary proceedings as a result.
According to that report, nearly 30 cases of bullying and harassment have been investigated at the FCA internally since 2016. Andrew Bailey, who was appointed CEO of the FCA in July 2016, is considered a front-runner to become the next governor of the Bank of England but his chances to take over that job will largely depend on how well he does at the FCA.
The report states that in the three years prior to 2016 just seven incidents were investigated while only two cases of bullying and harassment were probed between 2009 and 2012.
This has now reached the central government, and Maria Miller MP, who chairs the House of Commons Women and Equalities Select Committee, has stated that the figures could be a sign of “improved internal reporting” at the FCA but called on the Treasury Select Committee to look into misconduct at the financial regulator.
It could also be that the ‘snowflake’ generation, which is prevalent among public sector, left-leaning cosseted society, has become increasingly oversensitive and that when asked to not be late for work, for example, a threat of bullying could arise. There is no evidence to state that this is the case, but until all is investigated and proven, an open mind must be kept.
Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, who has been vocal about matters relating to the FCA, told Financial News: “The scale [of the investigations] is surprising and suggests an organisation in some stress.”
When asked by Financial News to comment on the matter, the FCA did not provide any statement on what steps it is taking to irradicate misconduct internally, but a spokesperson said: “Allegations that fall under the FCA’s equality complaints procedure are taken very seriously. In all cases we follow a formal investigation route, which recognises the serious nature of the allegations. Where an allegation is upheld, the FCA follows the disciplinary procedure in order to determine the appropriate sanction for the individual against who the allegations were raised.”
When looking at alleged bullying, it is of course very subjective as to what constitutes double standards.
Two years ago, when the FCA began to look at taking draconian steps toward restricting how CFDs are provided in a domestic market of largely satisfied customers who are loyal to large, 30 year established CFD firms on home soil, FX industry sentiment was that the FCA is effecting a type of bullying onto the OTC electronic trading industry, led by lobbying efforts from large exchanges.
“It is quite apparent that the regulators, along with other institutions are setting in place the framework to have the entire non-bank OTC business revamped on exchange” said a senior FX executive at the time.
“This is apparent from many things, one of which is the advertising bans which have been imposed on non-bank retail FX firms in France, Belgium and soon Germany while you can easily advertise the same underlyings on exchange” he continued.
Another angle from which pressure is mounting is from within the large exchanges, which many industry executives believ are attempting to lobby the regulators as well as to gain influential controlling stakes in OTC businesses in order to attempt to push all retail trading onto exchanges.
“CME Group is looking at a project whereby they come up with a rolling spot contract which is a direct competitor to OTC derivatives firms” said a London-based prime of prime executive.
“This is not a consolidation in my view, it is an attempt to move the non-bank retail FX business globally to a different model. The exchanges have woken up to the fact that a large part of their retail businesses has moved off exchange and they want to get the business back. Scandals in the OTC industry, bankruptcies related to SNB type events and binary options scammers have given ample justifications to exchange lobbyists to argue against the OTC retail industry. In the end who do you think has more clout with the FCA? The LSE or IG markets ? It is obvious who is going to win” said an institutional FX executive on the matter.
Mary Inman, who leads the international whistleblower practice at litigation specialist Constantine Cannon said: “The FCA is a role model to financial services firms, so it’s alarming that its own people are being accused of bullying and harassment. If the regulator can’t keep its own house in order, then how effective can it be when investigating City firms?”
Lawyers urged the regulator to include itself in the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, which was introduced in 2016 by the FCA to hold top managers responsible for failings on their watch.
“The FCA should as a matter of best practice be collecting data on itself annually regarding its whistleblowing, harassment, bullying, discrimination and victimisation reports and how it is faring – like an annual check-up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander. It would seem hypocritical for them not to do so,” Ms Inman added.
Thus, it could be construed that if a regulator wishes to lead an initiative to force the more innovative, yet smaller FX industry into submission to please the giants with lobbying power, then it must lead by its own example and not create alleged bullying and harassment complaints which subsequently end up in the public domain due to the transparent (thankfully!) climate of the United Kingdom.
Still, could be worse.. It could be the Labour Party in charge…

Story 146
The pan-EU regulator explains what it means for a risk warning to be prominent.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has today updated its Questions and Answers on ESMA’s temporary product intervention measures on the marketing, distribution or sale of CFDs.
The updated Q&A section provides clarification on the application of the temporary product intervention measures in relation to the prominence of risk warning regarding offering of CFDs to retail clients. The regulator explains how a firm should ensure the prominence of its CFD risk warnings.
Let’s recall that, under Article 2(e) of the CFD Decision, a firm must not send a communication directly or indirectly to a retail client, or publish information accessible by a retail client, relating to the marketing, distribution or sale of a CFD unless it includes the appropriate risk warning complying with certain conditions.
“The risk warning shall be in a layout ensuring its prominence, in a font size at least equal to the predominant font size and in the same language as that used in the communication or published information”.
Also, firms must comply with Article 44 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/5655, which specifies that information addressed to, or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by, a retail client must give a fair and prominent indication of any relevant risks when referencing any potential benefits of an investment service or financial instrument.
In the context of online marketing, giving prominence to the risk warning implies that it is displayed on the relevant webpages in a way that would signal that the message is of importance and makes it unlikely that a client or a prospective client would not to notice it. It should attract attention, for instance, by virtue of its size or position on the webpage.
In deciding whether a particular risk warning is ‘prominent’, firms have to consider the target audience, the characteristics of CFDs and the likely information needs of the average recipient of the communication, ESMA says.
Good practices that indicate firms have given sufficient prominence to a risk warning include:
Warnings are shown using easily readable font styles across a neutral background.
The size of the warning occupies a noticeable portion of the text displayed, taking into account the content, size and orientation of the communication as a whole.
Warnings are contained within their own distinct border, drawing the reader’s attention to them.
In the context of web pages, warnings remain fixed on the screen even when the customer scrolls up and down respective web page.
Warnings are repeated on linked pages further into the website product chain.
In communications other than web pages, warnings are clearly stated within the main body of the communication.
Examples of poor practice that will indicate firms have not given sufficient prominence to a risk warning include:

The partnership continues this year as Triple Eight readies its V6 turbo powerplant for a debut as a wildcard, which will require its own aerodynamic development and homologation.
Wirth Research was established in 2003 by Nick Wirth, best known as the founder and owner of short-lived Formula 1 outfit Simtek in the mid-1990s.
The company has been engaged in a variety of categories including F1, where it teamed with Virgin Racing to produce a grand prix car without use of a wind tunnel for the team's debut in 2010.
As windtunnels are banned in Supercars, Wirth provided CFD knowledge and computing power that is unavailable in Australia to design the ZB Supercar.
Triple Eight head designer David Cauchi and Wirth Research’s Race Car Programs Manager Robin Gearing worked closely via video links from the start of 2017.
Wirth Research’s Sportscar Chief Engineer, Baptiste Rossi, attended Triple Eight’s first run of the new Commodore in September last year and the first complete aero test in November.
Triple Eight tapped into Wirth's CFD knowledge
Triple Eight owner Roland Dane says the distance between his team and Wirth did not prove an issue during the process.
“Our relationship with Wirth Research has proved to be an invaluable aspect of the all-new Commodore development and has brought us industry-leading levels of expertise,” he said.
“With unrivalled experience across multiple motorsport categories, as well as world-class facilities, Nick and his team have been a natural fit for Triple Eight.
“Geographical factors, such as the time difference between Brisbane and the UK, haven’t been an issue at all and Wirth Research’s support has gone above and beyond expectations.
“We’ve built a strong relationship with all involved and we look forward to continuing our work with Wirth this year and hopefully into the future.”
Nick Wirth says he’s proud to have extended his company’s reach into Supercars.
“The application of our advanced CFD design capabilities is a first for the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship and we’re excited with the results for the next-gen Commodore Supercar,” he said.
“We very much look forward to building on the strong, collaborative relationship we have established with Triple Eight in the future.”
Triple Eight was responsible for the entire ZB design and homologation, having taken over factory status from Walkinshaw Racing last year.
The team had worked in partnership with Walkinshaw for the VF Holden and Tickford for the FG Ford, with its then technical director Ludo Lacroix designing the aerodynamics.
Every Holden Supercars team will run the ZB bodywork this season, which starts with the Adelaide 500 on March 1-4.

The idea is to match the measures introduced by ESMA and to implement them permanently at a national level.
Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) is planning to implement the temporary restrictions on the offering of CFDs to retail clients on a permanent basis at a national level. The regulator has earlier today published a draft general administrative act concerning the adoption of the restrictions on the marketing, distribution and sale of CFDs to retail clients in Germany.
BaFin notes the relevant product intervention measures introduced by ESMA which include maximum permissible leverage, a negative balance protection, a margin close out rule, a restriction on the incentives offered to trade CFDs and standardised clear risk warnings. BaFin is also including these protective measures for retail investors in its general administrative act.
With this, BaFin aims to permanently match the level of protection in Germany to the temporary product intervention measure issued by ESMA. This is intended to prevent attempts to evade these measures by providers from other EU countries.
In addition, in taking this step, BaFin is once again addressing the significant investor protection concerns expressed at the time of the initial prohibition regarding certain CFDs. BaFin considers in particular contracts for difference with additional payments obligations to carry an incalculable risk of loss for retail investors. The same applies for CFDs without leverage limits or negative balance protection.
BaFin also warns that retail investors should not be distracted from the high risks associated with CFDs by initial credit, discounts, bonuses or other incentives. For the same reason, BaFin also considers a standardised risk warning of the high probability of loss to be indispensable.
Comments on the draft legislation may be submitted in writing until January 10, 2019.
The move happens less than a month after BaFin unveiled its plans to introduce a permanent ban on binary options.

CAUTION! Watch at your own risk! This video may be addictive!

Watch, learn and discuss! It's short, but it provides great insights and plenty of room for discussion! And we even added some cool sound this time.

This animation shows the simulation of a car facing wind from the left. The car itself is basically stationary (no forward movement), but spinning around its center. This study was part of a safety check when regulations changed to ensure that the car wouldn't lift from the ground even when out of control.

CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) is a great tool which is not only used for aerodynamic research, but also for simulations of all kinds of fluids in the race cars. Different from the wind tunnel, CFD also allows to calculate and simulate temperatures. The two complement each other perfectly.

Human offshore wind farm inspection and repair crews could soon be replaced with the world’s first fully robotic team, thanks to a UK project.
The £4m Innovate UK-funded project, known as MIMRee (Multi-Platform Inspection, Maintenance and Repair in Extreme Environments), will develop and test an autonomous crew, consisting of an unmanned vessel, drone and crawling robot.
The technology is expected to save an average wind farm £26m over its lifetime.
Inspection and repair of offshore wind turbine blades is carried out by human technicians working on ropes in extreme conditions. Such inspections can only take place during restricted windows when the weather is good, according to Tony Fong, engineering manager for operational performance at the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult, which is providing its engineering expertise and testing facilities to the project.
“Specialist rope access teams have to descend down each of the blades in order to inspect and maintain them,” said Fong. “The turbines also have to be shut down during this maintenance, which costs the industry money because the turbines aren’t generating [electricity] during this time.”
The daily use of crew transfer vessels is also expensive, he said.
The two-year project will be led by Cambridge-based non-destructive testing specialist Plant Integrity.
The robotic crew will consist of Thales’ Halcyon autonomous vessel, as well as a drone system being developed by researchers at Bristol University, and the six-legged crawling repair robot BladeBUG, invented by entrepreneur Chris Cieslak.
“There will be a level of communication and teamwork between these systems that hasn’t been done before,” said Fong.
A system for transporting, deploying and retrieving the blade crawling robot will be developed at Manchester University, while an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to coordinate the mission and allow onshore personnel to analyse data transmitted by MIMRee is being developed at Royal Holloway University of London.
“The vessel will autonomously navigate its way safely to the wind turbines, and will then perform an inspection using a special camera, also developed by Thales,” said Fong. “This camera should be able to inspect the blade while the turbine is still rotating, allowing us to carry out a good level of inspection without losing any electricity generation.”
The on-board drone will then take off from the mothership, and carry out its own, closer visual inspection if needed, before going back to the vessel to pick up the crawling robot and place it on the turbine blade.
BladeBUG’s developer evaluated numerous types of robot for use in turbine inspection, but the complex shape of the blades, including their curvature and the addition of objects such as fin-shaped vortex generators, coupled with the need to travel from one side of a blade to the other, meant a legged robot was the best option, Fong said.
“The expectation is that the robot will be able to carry out more advanced inspections, such as high-resolution imaging and non-destructive sensing including ultrasound,” he said.
An electronic skin, developed by Wootzano, will “feel” the surface to collect data on the blade surface structure.
The robot will also be capable of carrying out basic maintenance tasks, such as cleaning and resurfacing the blades, thanks to a robotic arm developed by the Royal College of Art Robotics Laboratory.
“If there is minor damage to the paint surface on the blade, such as leading-edge erosion, the robot has the potential to go up and smooth out the surface, and apply a little bit of protective paint, to keep the turbine going in the most efficient manner,” Fong said.

A review has opened of applications that have failed to qualify for the latest round
The results of the UK’s third Contracts for Difference (CfD) allocation round will not be published until 6 September at the earliest after the EMR Delivery Body opened a review of applications that failed to qualify.
The opening of the so-called non-qualification review assessment window means the sealed bid renewables auction is now scheduled to begin between 9-15 August.
That date could move further backwards if non-qualifying applicants appeal to Ofgem following the review assessment.
The latest the auction could take place is 9-15 October, which would see the results published on 5-6 November.
The £65m CfD3 budget is expected to support the delivery of around 4GW of new renewables capped at a maximum of 6GW.
Technologies eligible for the CfD3 auction include offshore wind, remote island wind, wave, tidal, advanced conversion technologies, anaerobic digestion above 5MW, dedicated biomass with CHP and geothermal.

Story 155
Put on notice
ASIC has particular concerns with the provision of foreign exchange margin trading products by some online platforms to retail customers, after it was notified by several foreign regulators including from China that Australian players were selling products in international jurisdictions without proper licences. He said a handful of firms were being investigated.
It is also consulting with providers of controversial binary options, which allow customers to bet on the outcome of an event and get a fixed cash payout if they win but nothing if they don't, and contracts for difference, where investors can bet on the change in value of a share, foreign exchange rate or market index using borrowed money.
"We have the product intervention power now and we are starting to think really hard about binary options, and leveraged margin FX and CFDs.
"We will be doing a consultation about that and listening to what will be the impacts if we decide to do what has happened in Europe where they have effectively banned binary options and limited leverage quite significantly for margin products."
Equity market players and law firms have also been put on notice that from next financial year, ASIC will be applying artificial intelligence technology to better scrutinise prospectus documents for misleading statements or omissions.
A pilot of the 'natural language processing' technology has been a success. Mr Yanco said: "The computer can detect anomalies in prospectuses pretty much as well as people for which it is a pretty laborious task."

Use the checklist
After ASIC chairman James Shipton flagged the expansion of its 'close and continuing monitoring' program at ASIC's forum last week, Mr Yanco said ASIC has supervisory teams in 16 investment banks and stockbrokers.
They are conducting on-site reviews and have developed a "tailored supervision plan" for each firm taking into account risk appetite and management, and the teams are feeding concerns straight to the CEOs.
In wholesale markets, the ASIC teams are monitoring implementation of the FX Code of Conduct pushed globally by deputy governor of the Reserve Bank Guy Debelle.
ASIC also has members of its 'corporate governance taskforce' inside financial services firms, examining the management of non-financial risk and remuneration. "That's quite a big piece of work the government has funded for two years," Mr Yanco said.
After APRA called out widespread problems with non-financial risk monitoring on Wednesday, ASIC plans to report in August or September on remuneration, and early next year on the management of non-financial risk.
He encouraged brokers to benchmark themselves against APRA's recommendations in the CBA report.
"That is a really good checklist of things you might want to consider about how you manage non-financial risk – am I focusing the business on the spread of things I need to or am I overly focused on profits?"

ASIC is also ramping up its collection of data from stockbrokers.
Mr Yanco said the quality of data about the trading of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives was "not great" and ASIC is building a new portal for data to be provided and the market team has build a new data-lake to enhance detection activities.
"We are doing a lot of work in regulatory data and getting more data in to identify risks and red flags, risks and understanding businesses better."
He reminded the stockbrokers to keep in mind the mantra from Mr Shipton that they are working with "other people’s money", and to observe the "fairness challenge" the ASIC chairman issued at the end of its forum last week to ensure products and services are not doing any harm to customers.

In a little under two yearsâ time, F1 is aiming to begin an exciting new chapter in its illustrious history with new rules, a new governance structure, a new revenue distribution strategy and new cost controls. Over the past months, F1 bosses and the FIA have been working on a framework, which was presented to the teams and key stakeholders in London last week. But how close are we to getting a final agreement on what the championship will look like in the future? F1 motorsport boss Ross Brawn explains that he thinks âweâre closeââ¦ Speaking to Sky Sports F1âs Martin Brundle, he added: âItâs been arrived at with a lot of discussion. Everyoneâs view has been heard. If we take the cost cap, weâve had three or four people working on it, the FIA have had two or three people, weâve had Deloitte working on it. âIt has been a year of work, the teams have that now. They are incredibly comprehensive. Weâve made massive progress since this time a year ago and weâre very close to saying âthis is itâ now. âThis is where we want to beâ. There is still some room for discussion but I think the picture is clear.â Improving overtaking opportunities
One of the biggest criticisms of F1 in recent years has been the lack of overtaking â but this has been at the heart of the 2021 project and it seems there is some positive news on that front. âAt the moment, we have a car running in CFD and windtunnels which when they are behind another car loses 5% of its downforce. That is pretty small. At the moment, when they get nose-to-tail, the car behind loses 50% of the downforce. âItâs no surprise, weâve done that with ground effect. We are using the underside of the car a lot more and it gives us smoother wake behind the car. Itâs a dramatic difference, but itâs not the only thing we need to change to get close racing. If we donât get them together, it doesnât matter how well they can race each other.â Consensus on Power Units
In trying to define the power units of the future, it has been tricky to find a balance between appeasing the current manufacturers â Mercedes, Ferrari, Renault and Honda â who have committed huge time and resource to competing in F1, and creating a set of rules that entices new entities to join. But there is good news on this front. âThey will be noisier in 2021 and they will be more powerful,â said Brawn. âWe have introduced regulations to make sure more equality among the customers. Customer teams will have exactly the same engine as the work teams. We are putting initiatives in to make sure the costs are controlled for both the customer and the manufacturer. âWe are also putting more emphasis on drivers to control some parameters of the engine such as energy recovery, which comes from battery and hybrid motors, more of that will be under the control of drivers. So you can do things strategically to overtake. Everyone is on same page now, we have agreements with manufacturers.â Controlling costs
In the push to control costs, F1 bosses have been evaluating areas where standardisation can be introduced without damaging the authenticity of F1. That means allowing teams scope to develop parts that have a direct impact on performance, but looking at standardising parts that donât. âFor example, we want every team to have the same pit equipment,â said Brawn. âThere is a lot of stuff we have common ground on. There is some stuff we all agree shouldnât change and thereâs stuff in the middle being argued about. Everyone makes their own fire extinguishers. Itâs a nice technical challenge, but it doesnât add performance. We can standardise those and help reduce the costs.â Will Ferrari still get a historic bonus?
There has been contention in the past about how revenues are distributed. Currently some teams receive a bonus payment, no matter where they finish in the championship. Of those, Ferrari receive the biggest slice of the bonus pie, given their historic status and long-standing commitment to F1. Whether that continues is âbeing discussed at the momentâ, according to Brawn. He adds: âYou have to recognise Ferrari in F1, they are the oldest team. They are biggest brand in F1 and I think all the other teams recognise that Ferrari is important to F1. Itâs one of the reasons why some teams are involved in F1. I worked for 10 years at Ferrari, I understand the importance of Ferrari â but it has to be reasoned, has to be balanced.â The model used by Haas will be refined
Some teams have had issue with the model that American outfit Haas have used since they entered the championship in 2016. Gene Haasâ operation have a close relationship with Ferrari, which sees them take all non-listed parts from the Italian team. Their progress has been impressive and they ended up fifth in the constructorsâ championship last year, and at times had the fourth fastest car. While they take a lot of parts from others, many teams like McLaren and Williams still do a lot in-house in a bid to be a true constructor. âThe Haas model is interesting,â said Brawn. âIt has been very successful and itâs something we have to maintain for the future, for it to be possible for a small team to be able to come in and be pretty respectable. There is some trimming we need to do to what they have been able to do. I donât see a big change in the Haas model. âBut we need to make sure we remove the doubt some teams have about their co-operation with the big team, which is Ferrari. We need to make sure itâs well defined and everyone knows what you can and canât do. There are grey areas we need clarity on. Haas is a good model, we donât want to spoil it, but we want to make sure of its place in F1.â How will the race weekend evolve?
âSubtly,â says Brawn. Itâs more evolution rather than revolution, with elements of weekend tweaked to improve the show but also improve the working conditions for teams, particularly with the ambition to increase the calendar beyond the current 21 races. âThere are some things in the next year or two that we will do,â he said. âWe are working on a qualifying format which is similar to what we have now. You get elimination and still have top cars fighting for the top places, but you get more action, so we have an hour of intense action. âWe are looking at how we streamline the weekend for teams but not in terms of track action. We want to have two or more three races per season, but we think we can do that by not overstressing the teams by trying to refine their weekends. To give you an example, there is a curfew, a limit on hours teams can work on Friday night and Saturday night but not a Thursday, so they all work all night on Thursday to get ready. âWe are trying to crank it up a bit more [the number of races]. We have some exciting races coming up, Vietnam Iâm really excited about. There are some other races on the horizon. Despite the pessimism, Iâd be surprised if we lose any races we currently have. âWe need to improve the way we operate. Crates come in at all times of the day full of new parts [over a race weekend]. We can stop that. We can say the car that turns up is the car they race. It saves all that freight, all that work that is done over a race weekend.â Whatâs the deadline?

BEIS Secretary Greg Clark has ruled out a return to Pot 1 Contracts for Difference for onshore wind in light of the UK government’s faltering nuclear ambitions.
Addressing a BEIS select committee hearing on Wednesday morning, Clark said the Conservative government has a “settled position” on onshore wind as set out in its manifesto.
“We made a strategic decision to concentrate the Contracts for Difference auctions on offshore wind and one of the reasons for that was industrial strategy,” he added.
“That has been a huge success right around the country and we should stick with that approach.”
The government will respond to calls backing a support mechanism for onshore wind, said Clark, but his view is “the judgement made that is reflected in the manifesto is one that should prevail”.
He added: “We are now entering a world in which green power need not be subsidised.”

CHICAGO -- A Chicago Fire Department washout, involved in at least two troubled romances and lengthy domestic court actions, shot and killed his former fianceé, a Chicago police officer and a hospital pharmacy resident, according to law enforcement officials.Juan Lopez, 32, the gunman in a shooting at Chicago's Mercy Hospital on Monday, was killed during a firefight with Chicago police. The Cook County Medical Examiner said Lopez was killed by a police bullet - shot in the abdomen - despite also having a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head.According to court records from 2014 and '15 obtained by the ABC7 I-Team, Lopez's ex-wife accused him of brandishing a weapon against several people and threatening to show up at her workplace and cause trouble.As the I-Team first reported Monday, the hospital siege began when Lopez accosted his ex-fiancé Tamara O'Neal, 38, an emergency room physician at Mercy Hospital, who was leaving after her shift.Lopez shot O'Neal numerous times, investigators said, prior to the gunman storming the hospital and continuing his assault -- perhaps firing as many as three dozen rounds from a 9mm pistol according to police and witness accounts.O'Neal and Lopez were engaged to be married in late October, the I-Team reported, an engagement that was scrapped in September. On Tuesday Chicago police said that Lopez showed up at the hospital to retrieve the engagement ring he had given to O'Neal."He came over there because they had broken off their engagement and he wanted his engagement ring back," said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.Lopez was currently enrolled as graduate student at DePaul University. A DePaul spokesperson told the I-Team that he was "seeking a master's degree in public service. He earned a bachelor's degree here in 2013."The shooter's history also includes a 2014 attempt to become a Chicago firefighter. A spokesperson for the CFD says that he was terminated from the training academy because of improper conduct about two months after starting his training.The conduct involved workplace violence, according to CFD spokesman Larry Langford who says Lopez was accused of shoving female cadets.Also Tuesday, officials at the Chicago Housing Authority said Lopez was hired as an associate program specialist in February of this year. He worked in the customer care center in the Loop.CHA management said all housing agency employees are subject to background checks before being hired and that Lopez's hire was approved after undergoing background checks. Lopez did not have a history of complaints while he was employed there, officials said.In a statement, CHA CEO Eugene Jones Jr. said, "This was an unthinkable act of violence. We are filled with overwhelming sadness and our hearts go out to the families of those who died, and to all affected by this horrific tragedy."At the time of Monday's fatal shootings, Lopez was still entangled in a domestic court case with his ex-wife Monica De Asa. The couple was married in 2008 and had one child. They had a date scheduled in Cook County court on November 27 concerning financial questions in their child support agreement.Prior to filing for divorce from Lopez, Ms. De Asa obtained an emergency order of protection against her husband in 2014. In the court file obtained by the I-Team, De Asa claimed that her husband "has slept with pistol under his pillow" and that the gun was "accessible" to their young child.She also detailed that on two occasions in 2014 he "pulled out his gun with intent to harm," once on a neighbor and on another occasion pointing his weapon at a realtor.According to the court file, on December 1, 2014 Lopez "began sending threats via text message to come to my job and cause a scene."In the 2015 divorce filing, De Asa accused her husband of "constant infidelity and abuse."Lopez also had ongoing child support issues according to court records. Documents state that he had a difficult time keeping a job and refused to inform De Asa where he was working or living.Court documents reveal that in 2015 Lopez worked in security at Illinois Masonic Hospital in Chicago.Records also reveal that Lopez was employed in 2014 at Ingalls Hospital in south suburban Harvey. The I-Team has calls into administrators for both hospitals concerning his past employment.Lopez had a valid Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card and a Concealed Carry permit. Police investigators say he had purchased four weapons within the past five years.

Authorities announced the cause of death of Chicago Fire Department diver Juan Bucio, who died on Memorial Day while searching for a man who fell off a boat on the Chicago River.The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office determined that Bucio died of a rare heart condition called lymphocytic myocarditis that can cause heart failure. His death was also ruled accidental.Bucio, 46, was a 15-year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department, spending the last 11 years on the Marine and Dive Operations Unit.Bucio was part of a crew that was searching for a man who fell off a boat and into the river in the 2600-block of South Ashland Avenue at about 8 p.m. on Memorial Day. CFD officials said Bucio disappeared suddenly and lost communication with his team while searching for that man, identified as 28-year-old Alberto Lopez."Yelled out a mayday and they sent in another team to find firefighter Juan Bucio. He was located near the bottom," Chicago Fire Commissioner Jose Santiago said. "An order was given to switch out divers to bring the second team in, give them a break. At that time they were coming towards the boat. His partner turned around and he was missing. That quick."Once divers found him, he was rushed with a police escort to Stroger Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Bucio was honored with purple bunting hung around the city, and several fundraisers have been held in his name.Prior to CFD, Bucio was a Chicago police officer from 2000-2003, a police spokesman confirmed.The Chicago Fire Department said it's examining the results of the autopsy as part of its continuing investigation.

The forecast represents a downward revision from previously guided decline of 10-15%.
Lower volatility, range bound markets and the recently introduced restrictions on CFD offering to retail clients are set to dent revenues of online trading company CMC Markets Plc (LON:CMCX). The company has earlier today published an H1 2019 Pre-Close Trading Update.
After a robust first quarter, the second quarter has felt the impact of a sustained period of low market volatility and range bound markets towards the end of the traditional UK summer period, in addition to an expected decrease in overall client trading activity following regulatory change, the broker explains.
As a result, net operating income for 2019 is expected to be below previous guidance, with the overall impact on profitability partially mitigated by tight cost control.
The implementation of the ESMA measures has led to a drop in UK and European retail client activity. But the broker adds that after just two months it remains too early to draw any real conclusions as to how clients will adapt to the new rules. Taken alongside the aforementioned reduction in market volatility and range bound markets during a period of the second quarter, CFD and spread bet revenue for the full year is now expected to see a c. 20% reduction year-on-year, below previous guidance for a 10% to 15% reduction year-on-year.
On the brighter side, CMC Markets said that it continues to deliver on its strategy, having successfully completed the implementation of the white label stockbroking partnership with ANZ Bank in Australia as expected. This is poised to drive growth and further diversify revenues. In July, 103 intermediaries were migrated to CMC’s Stockbroking platform and, in September, ANZ Bank’s retail stockbroking clients were successfully migrated.
Furthermore, in response to client demand, MT4, the foreign exchange platform, will be launched in Q3 2019.
CMC Markets added that it keeps a strong focus on operating costs. Investments in strategic initiatives to drive future growth are ongoing, however discretionary spend around staff and marketing costs is now set to be lower than previous guidance. As a result, 2019 operating costs are now expected to be just slightly higher year-on-year, partially mitigating the overall impact of Q2 2019 revenue performance on Group profitability for the full year.
Throughout the Period (July 1, 2018 – September 25, 2018), the broker remained focused on increasing the proportion of UK and European revenue generated by professional clients (where the criteria are met). On a rolling 12-month view over 40% of UK and European revenue is now generated by professional clients, in line with previous guidance. Including institutional business this increases to 50%.

Tra le decisioni ratificate durante l’ultimo world motorsport council FIA del 5 Dicembre, vi è stata la delibera sull’utilizzo illimitato del CFD per lo sviluppo delle monoposto del campionato 2021. Il CFD, come noto, è l’acronimo del Computational Fluid Dynamics ovvero un’analisi numerica eseguibile dal computer per analizzare e risolvere problemi di fluidodinamica. In Formula 1 si usa per progettare sviluppi di componenti aerodinamici delle vetture. L’utilizzo libero del CFD per le monoposto del futuro si può considerare come una decisione strategica particolarmente importante ma, per il momento, del tutto ininfluente. Importante perché le limitazioni sull’utilizzo di CFD e galleria del vento definite nel regolamento vigente sono estremamente dettagliate e stringenti. Pertanto concedere uno spazio illimitato per utilizzare le simulazioni al computer consentirà di poter sviluppare rapidamente le vetture secondo i futuri regolamenti, senza intaccare il budget di ore limitate a disposizione per lo sviluppo delle monoposto impegnate nel campionato . Si tratta però di un aspetto, come si diceva, ininfluente per via del fatto che le nuove regole 2021 sono al momento in alto mare. Abbiamo per ora visto solo dei concept presentati da Ross Brawn a Singapore, dunque non c’è nessuna reale possibilità di iniziare una ricerca sensata da subito.
Ma quali sono esattamente queste limitazioni regolamentari? Prendete un bel respiro prima di leggere il seguito perché state per entrare in uno dei capitoli più cervellotici del regolamento sportivo che, nella sua ultima e recentissima edizione datata Ottobre 2018, dedica un’intera appendice di ben otto pagine per disciplinare le suddette restrizioni. Innanzitutto bisogna precisare che le limitazioni si applicano all’ interno di un determinato periodo di tempo detto ATP (Aerodinamic Testing Period) che dura 8 settimane. Durante un singolo ATP i team hanno a disposizione una limitata quantità di ore spendibili in galleria del vento e sul sistema CFD per effettuare test aerodinamici. Allo scadere di ognuno di questi periodi si riparte da zero con altre 8 settimane all’interno delle quali le squadre possono tornare a spendere le ore nuovamente disponibili. Il mix di ore spese al CFD e in galleria del vento è strategico per la riuscita di un progetto.
Se ad esempio un team sta studiando una nuova ala anteriore, realizzerà, per ipotesi, cinque modelli da provare al CFD. In base ai risultati ottenuti ne sceglierà ad esempio tre, i più promettenti, da realizzare fisicamente per i successivi test in galleria del vento. Da qui ne sceglierà due che verranno portati in pista durante le prove libere ed il pilota dovrà decidere quale utilizzare in gara. Se le ore al CFD ed in galleria sono state spese “male”, la squadra si troverà in difficoltà con un comportamento della vettura molto diverso da quello ottenuto “sulla carta”. Si tratta della famosa mancanza di correlazione tra i dati sperimentali e quelli in pista di cui molti tecnici e piloti parlano quando non vengono a capo di comportamenti imprevedibili della loro vettura. Ma come vengono calcolati i limiti di ore in galleria del vento e al CFD? Vediamolo di seguito.
Limiti sui test in galleria del vento
Vi sono numerose restrizioni sui test in galleria del vento definite per regolamento. Due su tutte la limitazione al 60% della scala massima dei modelli testati, e la massima velocità del flusso d’aria a 50m/s, pari 180km/h. Ogni team deve indicare a inizio anno una sola galleria del vento dove intende eseguire i test. Il numero di ore spese in test in galleria del vento è indicato con la sigla WT (Wind on Time) e deve essere registrato da ogni team perché soggetto a limitazione in funzione del tempo impiegato al CFD, come vedremo nel dettaglio più avanti. Ad ogni modo WT non potrà mai essere superiore alle 25 ore all’interno di un singolo ATP. Il regolamento arriva a definire addirittura che le ore di test vanno misurate dall’istante in cui la velocità del flusso d’aria in galleria è superiore ai 5m/s fino all’istante in cui si scende sotto questo valore durante la conclusione del singolo test.
Limiti sui test con software CFD
Ogni squadra iscritta al mondiale di Formula 1, deve comunicare per iscritto alla FIA una serie estesa di informazioni relative ai computer utilizzati nei suoi uffici di progettazione. Tra queste informazioni citiamo, per brevità, solo le principali che sono utilizzate per il calcolo dei limiti di utilizzo del CFD:
a) numero di computer utilizzati con indicazione del costruttore, modello, numero di serie e modello dei microprocessori utilizzati
b) NCU = numero totale dei microprocessori utilizzati su tutti i computer a disposizione, che dovranno essere omogenei tra loro.
c) CCF = frequenza massima di calcolo dei microprocessori espressa in GHz
d) MFPPC = numero massimo di calcoli in virgola mobile in sistema 64 bit (detti FLOPs che sta per Floating point Operations) che i computer sono in grado di eseguire.
A questo punto il regolamento definisce due metodi, A e B, di calcolare la limitazione sull’utilizzo del CFD. Ogni team dovrà decidere se attenersi al limite A oppure al limite B.
Metodo A:
si calcola il numero di ore contemporaneamente impiegate dai microprocessori dei computer nel calcolo CFD con questa formula:
MAUh = NCUxNSSxCCF/3600
dove AUh = allocation Unit hours ovvero la somma delle ore totali lavorate da tutti i processori del sistema e NSS = numero di secondi impiegati durante la simulazione al computer. NCU e CCF sono già state definite sopra. Il numero di ore che si ottiene da un calcolo del genere è dell’ordine dei milioni ed infatti si parla di Mega AUh (MAUh)
metodo B:
si calcola il numero di calcoli in virgola mobile contemporaneamente eseguiti dai computer (FLOPs) durante le simulazioni CFD con questa formula:
Tera FLOPs = (MFPPCxNCUxNSSxCCF)/(604.800x8x1.000)
il numero che risulta è dell’ordine delle migliaia di miliardi per cui viene espresso più sinteticamente in TeraFLOPs. A questo punto il regolamento stabilisce che l’impiego di tempo in galleria del vento WT sarà limitato dalla quantità di tempo impiegata per le simulazioni al CFD secondo le seguenti formule:
per i team che hanno scelto il metodo A:
WT <= 25h x ( 1 – MAUh/MAUh limite)
dove MAUh limite =10
per i team che hanno scelto il metodo B:
WT <= 25h x ( 1 – Tera FLOPs/Tera FLOPs limite)
dove Tera FLOPs limite =25
Quindi se consideriamo ad esempio il metodo A, se un team decidesse per assurdo di fare a meno del CFD avrebbe MAUh=0 e dunque una disponibilità di 25 ore di galleria del vento ogni 8 settimane (ATP). Se invece decidesse di impiegare i suoi computer su 5 milioni di ore di calcolo allora avrebbe a disposizione solo 12,5 ore di galleria del vento.
Se vi state chiedendo perché esistano due limiti sul calcolo col CFD, dovete sapere che il metodo B è stato il primo ad essere introdotto dal regolamento nel 2009. La FIA si proponeva di imporre una limitazione contingentando il numero di calcoli eseguibili dai computer. Tuttavia l’introduzione di processori sempre più veloci sul mercato, come normalmente accade nel settore informatico, fece sì che il valore di CCF aumentò a scapito del numero massimo di calcoli eseguibili (MFPCC) che dovette diminuire sempre di più per restare nei limiti imposti. Si arrivò al punto che alcuni team chiesero e ottennero dai loro fornitori di hardware, la produzione di microprocessori ad hoc per garantire un valore basso di CCF ed elevato di MFPCC. Questo per non avere computer che restassero inattivi per giorni interi perché troppo veloci nel raggiungere il limite di TeraFLOPs, peraltro con pochi calcoli eseguiti. Il caso più celebre è quello del microprocessore AMD Opteron 6275, realizzato per questo scopo, ed a cui fu dato il soprannome di “Fangio”, in onore del pentacampione del mondo di F1 argentino. Questa stortura è stata risolta dalla FIA nel 2018 con l’introduzione del suesposto limite A che agisce più ragionevolmente sul numero di ore utilizzate per il calcolo.
Ovviamente la FIA deve essere in grado di controllare che queste limitazioni siano rispettate e, per questo motivo, il regolamento prescrive che entro 14 giorni dalla scadenza di ogni ATP, ogni team deve fornire alla Federazione un corposo dossier dei test eseguiti al CFD ed in galleria del vento. Questi dossier devono essere compilati secondo protocolli ben definiti. La Federazione si riserva poi di effettuare controlli in ogni momento. Sia nelle gallerie designate dai team, che nei loro uffici tecnici.
Il regolamento vigente prescrive inoltre che i sopracitati limiti di 10 MAUh o 25 TeraFLOPs dovranno essere rivisti ogni tre anni a partire dal 1 gennaio 2018. Qui torniamo alla notizia di apertura di questo articolo che di fatto introduce una serie di scenari molteplici. Non appena saranno finalmente chiari i dettagli aerodinamici del regolamento tecnico 2021, le squadre si troveranno a lavorare al CFD su due progetti con limitazioni diverse. Supponiamo di essere nel 2020. Avremo i team che svilupperanno la monoposto del 2020 al CFD coi limiti appena illustrati, mentre non avranno limitazioni per il progetto inerente alla vettura 2021. Dal 1 gennaio 2021 i limiti A e B scadranno e dovranno essere riscritti, verosimilmente lasciando solo il limite A. Si tornerà quindi in un regime normativo più semplice per tutti.
Tutto questo fa riflettere una volta di più su quanto sia complessa oggi la progettazione di una monoposto di Formula 1. Le regole vigenti si spingono a cercare di disciplinare la progettazione di componenti aerodinamici imponendo un meccanicismo asfissiante che, se da un lato ha il pur nobile scopo di livellare le risorse tra i team partecipanti al mondiale, dall’altro impone complessità notevoli da rispettare e probabilmente anche da controllare. Sono finiti i tempi in cui dalla matita di un John Barnard o di un Rory Byrne poteva nascere una soluzione aerodinamica geniale. La progettazione dell’aerodinamica di una monoposto moderna dipende molto dai software e computer a disposizione. Citando il nostro direttore Mauro Coppini, “oggi dai computer abbiamo le risposte a tutte le domande, la cosa difficile è saper fare loro le domande giuste“.

âWe've got these big ups and downs and when we've got ups, we put ourselves down one way or another. So that is quite frustrating.
âI'm still not over it,â he said on Thursday in Germany. âYou've got a certain amount of opportunities and obviously this year we are struggling in some of the races.
Bad enough at any race of course â but with Haas having planned to use the 52 laps of the British Grand Prix to gain crucial information on the VF-19âs performance quirks, with Grosjean and Magnussen running two different specs to allow them to compare and contrast, the loss of that data-gathering opportunity was what had really got Steinerâs goat.
Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen touched as they were running side-by-side through Silverstoneâs Aintree corner on the opening lap of the British Grand Prix, the resultant damage on the cars forcing Haas, currently ninth of 10 teams in the constructorsâ standings , to retire both of them.
They say that time is the great healer â but the two weeks since Silverstone hasnât been enough to allow Guenther Steiner to regain his composure, with the Haas Team Principal still fuming about his two driversâ opening lap contact when he arrived at Hockenheim for the German Grand Prix weekend.
âThey need to understand where we are, and that's the disappointing thing to me,â he continued. âThey didn't let me down as a person, they've let the team down, which is disappointing. And as I said, I'm still not over it â normally I get over things pretty quick, but this one, because we had a clear talk after [they made contact in] Barcelona, what to do and what not to do and it wasn't followed, which is disappointing.â
Haas will now spend the German Grand Prix trying to make up for the lost time from Silverstone, with Magnussen and Grosjean set to try out three different aerodynamic specs across Fridayâs running. And Magnussen was optimistic that the newest one of those would help the team move forward, with Haas having struggled with inconsistent race pace so far in 2019.
âWe have a busy weekend here, with all the stuff that we're trying,â he said. âI'm running one spec of car in FP1, then another spec in FP2 and Romain is running a third spec on Friday, so lots of stuff to look at.
âI wouldn't say [the specs] are drastically different but it's interesting. It looks good on the car, so let's hope it feels good as well.

âYou always hope that what you find in the windtunnel and CFD [computational fluid dynamics] is going to work on track, so that's my real hope and obviously the new upgrades for this race, they are obviously supposed to be better but it's not a huge amount in outright lap time. It looks like it's more of a solid package, so let's hope it shows like that and that it gives something.â
With neither Magnussen nor Grosjean having scored any points in the last four races, a strong German Grand Prix for the team on Sunday â and certainly one where the drivers donât take each other out of the race â now looks essential if Haas are to turn the tide of whatâs becoming one tough old season for the American squad.

Contrary to predictions, Red Bull motorsport boss Helmut Marko is adamant that F1's new-for-2019 front wings won't improve overtaking, but they will however increase costs.
In a bid to promote closer racing, F1 is implementing an aerodynamic regulation overhaul for 2019 centered around a simplified front wing concept with a larger span, the purpose
However, according to Germany's Auto Motor und Sport, simulations by teams are delivering a set of numbers that aren't lining up with expectations.
"F1 teams already reached 2018 downforce levels in 2019 CFD simulations - despite new front wing regulations," wrote AMUS' Tobi Grüner on Twitter.
"Red Bull stating additional costs of 15m Euro, suspecting it will have zero effect on overtaking."

And over at Milton Keynes, Helmut Marko has confirmed the preliminary results of the CFD simulations.
"Our simulations show that nothing changes. Overtaking is just as difficult. The whole exercise just costs us money."
Marko also believes the wider, deeper front wings will quickly become collateral damage during wheel-to-wheel racing, and necessitate a return to a narrower design for 2021.
"We can't do a shot in the dark like this again," Marko insisted.
At Faenza, Toro Rosso boss Franz Tost echoed Marko's concerns.
"I discussed it with the people in the wind tunnel and they do not believe overtaking will become much easier," said Tost.
"I think at the beginning of next season the teams will have reached a similar level of downforce as now."
Earlier this year, Red Bull Racing's Christian Horner warned that the 2019 rules changes would inevitably elevate development costs for 2019. He has now been proven right.
"We talk about costs and being responsible, what's been introduced is a completely new concept, a completely new car that will cost millions and millions of pounds," he said.
"I just find it frustrating that decisions are made on zero evidence or zero conclusions, on theories and the burden of costs is passed onto the teams.
"Is it going to guarantee that the cars can follow closer next year? Probably not."

The popularity of aero road bikes has been on a consistent upward trajectory over the past decade. The fascination with going faster by using less energy has long been considered the holy-grail in cycling, and this need for speed, particularly in the pro peloton, has led to vast investment from manufacturers, which has resulted in radically faster, more compliant and lighter-weight aero bikes, thanks to advances in aerodynamic understanding, computational fluid dynamics testing, and improved carbon-fibre layering techniques.
Truncated aerofoil tube profiles, component integration and deep-section aero wheels have become the order of the day as bike manufacturers attempt to out-do each other in a bid for the fastest aero road bike crown.
While significantly lighter than the time trial bikes from which they draw inspiration, the modern aero road bike is designed to save you watts by cutting through the air like a samurai sword. There's a lot of science involved but even the casual weekend rider will find it difficult to dispute the speed gains of the aero road bike - both from a visceral and physical sense.
However, it's not just speed, watt savings and reduced drag coefficients but also all-round comfort that has become an important factor to consider when choosing an aero road bike. Early examples of aero road bikes were known for their unforgiving ride qualities, but that's not the case anymore. It appears as though the recipe has been mastered with all modern examples offering a well-balanced combination of speed, weight and compliance.
Aero road bikes explained
The more-easily a moving object cuts through the air, the less energy it needs to keep it moving - it's simple physics really. What this means is that if the playing fields were equal and every cyclist possessed the exact same metabolic engine, the rider with the most aerodynamic bike would win the race - every time.
The speed at which the benefits of improved aerodynamics become greater than that of saving weight is around 15kph, which, depending on fitness, is likely to be at a gradient of around six per cent. Therefore, in all but the steepest of mountain days, it's not necessarily the lightweight bike that wins the race, but the one that is best suited to the topography.
In the pro peloton, team mechanics are now able to get their aero road bikes close to the minimum weight limit of 6.8kg, meaning there's little to be gained by using a brand's less-aerodynamic 'lightweight' offering. However, for the rest of us, where that limit doesn't apply, the decision ought to be a more considered one. Here are a few attributes to look at before buying an aero road bike.
Aerofoil tubing
Round tubes are out and truncated, tear-drop-style tubing is in. These wind-tunnel-honed shapes have resulted in faster, more slippery bikes which have also made for some aggressive-looking facades, too.
Integration
One of the biggest buzzwords, when it comes anything pertaining to aero bikes, is integration. Simply put, integration refers to the seamless melding of proprietary components to the bike's frame so that the overall aerodynamics are not adversely affected. As such the cockpit, brakes and seatpost have all been refined and positioned so as not to meddle with the bike's drag coefficient. Some brands offer one-piece handlebar/stem combinations with hidden cables, others neatly integrate the brake calipers or utilise frame-specific seatposts with invisible binders.
Wheels
Bar some of the more entry-level offerings in each model range, most aero road bikes come with deep rim profiles as standard. Just remember that you can always upgrade your wheelset should you require something more aggressive.

The SystemSix moniker is nothing new to Cannondale, having first appeared 12 years ago in the form of a hybrid carbon fibre/aluminium composite frame. Ahead of its time in many ways, it paved the way for future models such as the lightweight and dynamic SuperSix Evo, which has also been given the aero treatment.
The blueprint of the all-new SystemSix - Cannondale's first dedicated aero road bike - has been touted by the American company to be the 'fastest on the planet'. At 7.8kg it may seem a little on the portly side but Cannondale says the added grams will do little to thwart progress, even on the hills.
The SystemSix makes an endearing case for itself as far as free speed is concerned. It's seriously fast - be it on a descent, flat or climb, and the powerful disc brakes make for controlled modulation mid-corner.
Offering a choice of Shimano Dura-Ace Di2, Ultegra Di2, Ultegra mechanical and Red eTap AXS groupsets, there should be a SystemSix for all levels of budget.

Developed in collaboration with Team Ineos the Pinarello Dogma F12 is available in both rim- and disc-brake guises, both of which were developed independently of each other in a bid to ensure the brand's race-honed tenets remained unsullied.
As such, disc-equipped versions benefit from a 40 per cent stiffer fork to better deal with the added braking forces of powerful hydraulic brakes while rim-brake models have finally made the move to direct-mount calipers. Interestingly, Pinarello decided to skip the F11 moniker and jump straight to F12, just like the F10 before it which chose to forgo the F9 badge.
As a dedicated aero road bike, Pinarello has ensured the Dogma F12 has achieved the best aerodynamic efficiency values of any of its predecessors, thanks to re-worked, wind-tunnel-optimised asymmetric tubing. While it still retains the same flat back downtube of the F10, it gets a kinked top tube - an addition the Italian brand claims is a case of form following function.
Other key updates include a redesigned bottom bracket and chunkier chainstays which have bolstered stiffness by 10 per cent (over the F10), improved tyre clearance, and prompted the use of internal cable routing thanks to the new Talon Ultra integrated handlebar.
The one downside of the F12 is its overall weight. Ahead of the Tour de France's more-mountainous days, in a bid to bring the weight down to the UCI's 6.8kg minimum weight limit, Team Ineos invested in a number of £5,000 Lightweight Meilenstein Obermayer wheelsets.

The Bianchi Aria is one of the most versatile aero road bike offerings gathered here. Not only is it super-efficient in a straight line boasting a phenomenal turn of speed, but it's also impressively responsive to directional changes thanks to the steep head angle and racy geometry.
The frame comprises all the aero-optimised shapes you'd expect from a bike of this nature, with an integrated frame and fork, dropped seat stays and a d-shaped seat post - it all looks very fast.
The range comes in the choice of both rim- and disc-brake options and while it does err on the heavy side, it still climbs well and offers impressive compliance despite lacking the Countervail technology as used on the brand's higher-value models such as the Oltre.
That said, if it's greater comfort you're after, disc-equipped versions can accommodate wider tyres - the Aria comes with 28C road tyres as standard.

Ride quality on the firmer side
The Scott Foil aero road bike may not be the cheapest option out there but when it comes to ride comfort, aesthetics and integration - it's a difficult bike to trump. In fact, with stage wins at all three grand tours, a slew of classics victories, and a rainbow jersey to boot, the Foil's pedigree is indisputable as an out-and-out race bike.
While the line-up still comprises both rim brake- and disc brake-equipped models, it's the latter that adds enhanced levels of comfort thanks to the use of wider tyres. Unlike the rim-brake version which utilises a bottom-bracket-mounted caliper (something that limits the use of crank-based power meters) the disc version is compatible with all power meters, crank-arm units included.
Regardless of which model you prefer the Foil is one of the most comfortable aero road bikes in the segment - it has won Paris-Roubaix after all.

The notion of aerodynamics is nothing particularly new to Cervelo having single-handedly created the aero road bike concept back in 2002 with the aluminium Soloist. With aerofoil tubing developed by NACA – the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics – the Soloist was unlike anything seen before.
Like all models in Cervelo's S range, the S3 has been designed to be as slippery as possible utilising wind tunnel testing data to refine frame geometry and reduce drag coefficient. As such the S3 has gone with internal cable routing and a new bar and stem to complement its wind-cheating physique, something Cervelo dubs TrueAero - which makes it faster than the previous-generation S5.
All these tweaks have resulted in a 102g weight saving over its predecessor. It's also stiffer and more compliant than before and the range also benefits from the added surety of hydraulic disc-brake modulation.

The third-generation Specialized Venge is the lightest version yet with dropped seat stays and shaped tubing that make for an aggressive and purposeful facade.
Honed in the company's 'Win Tunnel' wind tunnel, the Venge favours speed and performance over comfort – Specialized claims the new Venge will save you 8 seconds over 40km compared to its predecessor, the Venge ViAS.
That's not to say it's bereft of any sense of compliance. While it may not boast the fancy suspension trickery of the Roubaix, the Venge gains added levels of comfort by way of bigger tyres and lower pressure, it can handle rubber of up to 32mm.
The new model also benefits from a more user-considered build - for example, split headset spacers enable adjustment without the need to re-cable the entire front end.

The Giant Propel Advanced, like its rivals, is available in both rim- and disc-brake configuration but boasts a high level of integration across the board to ensure it stays slippery. In fact, it's only the entry-level Propel Advanced 1 that utilises a regular stem/bar cockpit.
Although the range still makes do with a couple of rim-brake options, the Propel Advanced was completely redesigned in 2018 with disc brakes in mind using both Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing, the result of which has culminated in a 10-watt improvement over its predecessor.
One of the Propel's most intriguing attributes is the stem which hides the shift cables and brake hoses and keeps everything tidy. The range also gets wind-cheating deep-section 42/65mm front/rear aero wheels outfitted in the choice of Giant's very own SLR or Cadex monikers.

You'd expect something as aero-looking and performance-orientated as the Trek Madone to possess a harsh and unforgiving ride quality but it doesn't. Like the Domane, the Madone also utilises an IsoSpeed decoupler, but in this application, it's located in the top tube and offers a certain degree of adjustability – something Trek claims has boosted comfort and stiffness by 17 and 21 per cent respectively.
The Madone however, has always been a proponent of aerodynamic trickery and, as such, employs a compendium of clever go-faster techniques such as an integrated two-piece carbon bar and stem (SLR models), Kammtail Virtual Foil tubing and disc-equipped aero wheels that will accommodate tyres of up to 28mm.
A lighter rim brake version is also available with repositioned front brakes behind the fork for improved aero proficiency. As the range-topper in the Trek road bike range, all Madones feature carbon frames and high-end SRAM or Shimano groupsets.

The Merida Reacto aero road bike has been updated to be more in line with modern trends - lighter, aero and more efficient. As such, the Reacto's slimmed down, aerofoil tubing and dropped seat stays make up the majority of the aero alterations.
Apart from the enhanced aerodynamic gains, the dropped seat stays and S-Flex carbon seat post provide improved levels of comfort and pliancy by flexing and absorbing road chatter.
Despite the manufacturer's claims of bolstering comfort and pliancy, it's still one of the stiffest and most responsive aero road bikes in the category, a fact underscored by the use of high-end CF4 carbon and aggressive frame geometry complete with integrated Vision Metron cockpit on its raciest of models.

Since last few years no one is building a wind tunnel because they are so expensive. McLaren and Force India are using Toyota’s wind tunnels because buying one or renovating their old ones are not worth the cost. The future of wind tunnels is clear. Many teams have already transitioned to using CFDs instead of the wind tunnel. CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) is the digital representation of flow conditions.
Speaking of their choice in Force India, the team’s Chief Technology Officer Andy Green said: “With CFD we get a better idea of what’s really going on in the car than the wind tunnel model. Previously, the ratio was 60:40 in favour of the wind tunnel, now it’s the other way round at around 70:30 for CFD. In the meantime, we rely heavily on CFD because you can see things on the computer that are impossible to see in the wind tunnel.”
Explaining further, he said: ” wind tunnel tests are costly. They cost time and tie up a lot of staff. There must be a change to the model for each modification.”
From road cars to motorsports
While many teams have created their own CFD software to match their individual needs, there are a few external providers. US-based Exa is the largest CFD provider for Formula 1. Automobile giants like BMW, Fiat, Chrysler, Ford and Honda use Exa software to create simulations for their road cars. Slowly, Exa has developed an interest in the motorsports side of the equation, especially since the speed of development is a lot faster in motorsports than road cars.
Exa supplies its CFD software to racing teams in Formula One, WEC, DTM, the US racing scene. They also provide a basic software called Powerflow for Formula E. BMW was the first customer to use Exa’s software in motorsport. They used it because a digital wind tunnel costs a lot less than a real one.
CFD simulations have shown that in the current cars, air turbulence behind the car reunites just where the front wing of the following car. This means loss of drive for the car behind and less grip on the tires as a result.
Formula One’s new owners have already used CFD data to figure out how to change the aerodynamic rules to reduce the dirty air so that cars can follow each other more closely. For 2019, the front wing and brake vents have been simplified as the first step towards improving the racing.
F1 is planning to implement a lot of aerodynamic changes via their 2021 regulation to improve overtaking.

SmartTruck, a small business in Greenville, SC, recently completed its first detailed unsteady analysis using modeling and simulation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and has become the first company to request certification from the EPA through computational fluid dynamics (CFD).


In 2016, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued the Phase 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles. The regulations aim to reduce carbon emissions and improve the fuel efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles by among other things, minimizing drag.
Historically, companies that manufacture the trucks and their add-on parts have been permitted to certify their products only through physical testing, often using a wind tunnel.
The EPA has offered the option to certify accessory products by CFD calculations, which describe the properties and interactions in a flow—in this case, the airflow that runs past traveling tractor trailers.
Certification by CFD would be convenient and, ultimately, cheaper by eliminating uncontrollable variables that hamper physical testing (e.g., weather, test track availability, and the cost of wind tunnel testing). The Phase 2 program requires the more rigorous unsteady (versus steady) CFD analysis and aims to determine best practices that could extend to a range of CFD challenges in the industry.
Access to the computational resources at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), a US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility at DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), enabled SmartTruck to successfully complete, for the first time, a detailed unsteady analysis using modeling and simulation. As a result, SmartTruck also became the first company to request certification through computational analysis instead of through physical testing.
From 2009 to 2010, SmartTruck used the OLCF’s resources to design its original add-on components. Given the company’s experience with computational modeling and simulation in the design process, it saw the new regulations as an opportunity to leverage that technical experience to become the first ground vehicle device manufacturer to submit products for EPA certification though CFD.
To ensure scientific accuracy, the EPA had specific requirements that the team needed to reproduce computationally. Realistic-looking tires with tread, hoses of compressed air in front of the tires, the general shape underneath the hood, and air coming through the radiator itself are some of the additions the team had to make in its initial simulations of a computational baseline vehicle.
The SmartTruck engineers then had to decide which parts to certify using the newly permitted computational approach. They selected the TopKit Aero product, consisting of the Aero Rain Guard (the roof piece) and Side Fairings, external plastic pieces that reduce drag on the sides and back of the trailer.
The TopKit is essentially half of an aircraft wing. It works by forcing the fast-moving air on the top and sides of the trailer to shoot into the parachute-like area of drag coming off the back, drastically reducing it. Things like this aren’t easily simulated in a scale model wind tunnel. —Nathan See, Principal Engineer Aerodynamics at SmartTruck
The engineers needed to introduce new modeling techniques to capture higher order physics to meet the rigorous EPA standards. SmartTruck could demonstrate its products’ performance precisely only through time-accurate unsteady analysis, a type of computational analysis that represents real-life conditions more reliably than the commonly used steady analysis. Steady-state analyses assume that a flow’s behavior will continue into the future and repeat itself, whereas unsteady analyses can factor in time, thereby solving for details that are impossible to capture using steady-state analysis alone. SmartTruck engineers had never before undertaken such an approach.
The kinds of simulations we’ve done previously were nowhere near this complex. It was like going from grade school to graduate school—a huge leap in technical demands for us. —Nathan See
The company was faced with a computing challenge so great, it again needed high-performance computing (HPC) resources significantly more powerful than what it had available internally.
To conduct a full unsteady analysis of the TopKit Aero product, the engineers applied for time on the resources at the OLCF, which houses HPC resources available to users in industry, academia, and government. In 2017 the team was granted a Director’s Discretionary award through the Accelerating Competitiveness through Computational Excellence program (ACCEL), to complete the simulations.
The engineers first created a computational baseline vehicle that included both tractor and trailer and the features that the EPA required to ensure they had a solid model from which to launch simulations of SmartTruck’s products.
The team used CFD to include a more complex numerical modeling of the physics than what is required for steady-state simulations. For time-accurate analysis, they needed to solve in the time domain across five different physics equations with additional turbulence equations.
Running first a half model truck—cut down the middle—and then a full model truck with the same physics, they guaranteed the accuracy of the baseline model compared with the real world.
This series of iterations was critical to helping us adapt the flow solver settings, the grid settings, and the geometry settings so that the baseline model actually represents what would happen in real life. —Nathan See
See and his team needed to use the largest grid size possible for their 3D simulations without changing the soundness of the physics. Calculating smaller grid cell sizes is more computationally intensive, but larger grid cell sizes can be less accurate, so finding a balance of both is essential for the efficient use of computing resources. After three different grid studies and more than 20 simulations, the team found a grid size for the baseline that ensured the solution was not dependent on this variable.
The team compared the baseline vehicle with the same model with the TopKit Aero product attached, using full unsteady time-accurate simulations that took weeks to run, even on OLCF resources. The engineers employed NASA’s FUN3D CFD code for the simulations, working alongside Eric Nielsen, software developer at NASA Langley Research Center, throughout the project. Specifically, Nielsen worked with See to adjust the settings for the FUN3D flow solver, which predicts the physics of the flow that occurs during simulations.
Through the simulations, the team demonstrated a reduction in the parachute-like area of drag on the back of the truck. Also called the delta drag-area improvement, it is the main criterion used by EPA for certification and, in this case, equated to an approximate 6.6 percent reduction in drag and a roughly 4–5 percent increase in fuel efficiency. SmartTruck used these simulations and the delta drag-area improvement as proof of its compliance with Phase 2 regulations, becoming the first company to submit to EPA an aerodynamic device for certification through computational methods alone.
Simulations show the difference in airflow (blue) between the Class 8 tractor trailer CFD baseline vehicle (top) and parts-attached vehicle (bottom). The drag reduction effect is created through the manipulation of the base-wake behind the vehicle by SmartTruck’s TopKit Aero product (red). Video Credit: SmartTruck
Using numerical simulation on OLCF resources instead of physical testing, we reduced the time to complete the certification process by 25 percent and reduced the cost by 75 percent. Eventually, we will release the details of our methods and process to accelerate the adoption of simulation for certification of aerodynamic components. —Semir Kapetanovic, Vice President Research & Engineering at SmartTruck
Because SmartTruck’s products often work as systems of parts that are interchangeable, each product set needs to be certified on its own. During simulations of the TopKit, the team discovered it would be a bit more challenging to certify some of its other components.
Although the drag on the back of the truck was straightforward to capture, the underneath of the trailer proved difficult to represent computationally.
Once you get underneath the trailer or inside the tractor trailer gap, you have these small eddies, or vortices, that just make the flow chaotic. They’re shooting off everything, they’re running into each other, they’re bouncing around—it’s a giant mess. —Nathan See
This will require additional CFD simulations, some of which See is undertaking at the OLCF. Certifying components underneath the trailer, which capture and improve this slower airflow, is the company’s next step.

World’s Largest CFD Simulation Upends Conventional Wisdom in Bicycle Racing
World’s Largest CFD Simulation Upends Conventional Wisdom in Bicycle Racing
ANSYS, Cray, and a university researcher have conducted the first aerodynamic simulations of a full peloton of road cyclists, yielding some unexpected results.
If you’re not in the cycling world, a peloton is the term for the main group of riders in a road bicycle race. A peloton is used by teams to minimize air resistance for riders in the interior of the formation by taking advantage of the shelter provided by other riders on the exterior. The idea is to optimize the amount of energy expended during the race in order to maximize team performance, especially for the team’s elite riders. As such, pelotons are the basis for much of the strategy around these competitions.
It was thought that riders in the middle of the peloton would save as much as 40 to 50 percent of their energy compared to a lone cyclist as a result of reduced air resistance. That was based on fairly simple mathematical models without the benefit of digital modeling. However, anecdotal information from actual racers suggested the drag reduction was much greater.
As it turns out, they were right.
Simulations conducted by Professor Bert Blocken of Eindhoven University of Technology and KU Leuven on an XC-class Cray supercomputer running ANSYS Fluent CFD software found that air resistance is only 5 to 7 percent that of a solo cyclist – an order of magnitude smaller than what simple calculations had indicated. That makes it about four times easier to pedal in the middle of the peloton than if you are cycling by yourself.
The aerodynamic simulations modeled a full peloton of 121 cyclists, comprising three billion cells. To get accurate air resistance data, the calculations were performed as close as 0.020 millimeters from the surface of the rider and the bicycle. The computations used a total of 108 supercomputing hours across 13,824 processes. According to ANSYS and Cray, this is the largest fluid dynamics simulation using commercial software, as well as the largest aerodynamics sports simulation ever performed.
The simulations indicated that the lowest drag is experienced in rows 12 to 14, but they also found that everyone, even the lead cyclist, derived some benefit from being part of the peloton. The various reductions in air resistance (compared to a lone rider) are illustrated below.
According to Blocken, the results were so surprising they conducted wind tunnel testing to validate the results, which they did. He thinks the newly discovered knowledge will have practical application for racers in competition. “These results teach them how important it is to stay well sheltered in the peloton as long as possible: you save a lot of energy and remain fresh until the final rush of the race,” explains Blocken.
Although this is not exactly a “grand challenge” application, it does illustrate the how useful these simulations can be for problems that have remained largely unexplored. “In a time when simulation is crucial to accelerate and amplify innovation for high tech industries, the peloton project and its surprising results illustrate that this simulation technology is truly pervasive and can make a huge difference in a popular sport such as cycling,” concludes Thierry Marchal, Global Industry Director for Sports and Healthcare at ANSYS.

Al di là della rivoluzione alla guida della Scuderia Ferrari, con Mattia Binotto nominato nuovo Team Principal al posto di Maurizio Arrivabene, i lavori sulla monoposto di Maranello per il mondiale F1 2019 sono ormai in dirittura di arrivo.
Tra un mese esatto, il 15 febbraio prossimo, saranno tolti i veli alla Ferrari F1 2019 con la quale Sebastian Vettel e Charles Leclerc saranno chiamati a difendere i colori del Cavallino Rampante.
Le monoposto 2019 si differenzieranno dalle vetture 2018: è stato infatti varato un nuovo regolamento tecnico che interesserà principalmente l’ala anteriore, quella posteriore e il serbatoio del carburante.
Tutti questi cambiamenti hanno impegnato, già dall’estate scorsa, i reparti tecnici dei Team di Formula 1 per trovare le migliori soluzioni per evitare di avere un gap prestazionale rispetto alle vetture 2018.
In questi giorni si è cominciato a parlare di come potranno essere le nuove monoposto F1 2019: è probabile che assetti rake spinti lascino il posto a soluzioni più “neutre” o meno estreme, come anticipato da Cristiano Sponton su F1AnalisiTecnica e ripreso anche da Franco Nugnes di Motorsport.
Si è parlato anche di un lavoro sul passo, per sfruttare al meglio il corpo vettura dal punto di vista della ricerca di carico e di efficienza aerodinamica, in parte persa per via del cambio regolamentare.
Come appreso poi da CircusF1 in questi giorni, in casa Ferrari, il Direttore Tecnico Mattia Binotto avrebbe chiesto uno studio comparativo al CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) di due diverse soluzioni di musetto anteriore. Una richiesta non del tutto nuova in quanto, già con James Allison alla guida del reparto tecnico, si era portato avanti uno studio simile, poi abbandonato!
Un primo progetto (670A) ha previsto di integrare la nuova ala anteriore con specifica 2019, su una evoluzione del telaio 2018.

Un secondo prototipo (670B) è stato invece realizzato con un approccio diverso, lavorando su un musetto molto più simile a quello visto in questi ultimi anni in casa Mercedes.

Gli studi sono stati impostati prima della pausa estiva ed è del tutto probabile che in settembre si sia deciso quale delle due soluzioni dovesse poi essere utilizzata per lo sviluppo della nuova Ferrari F1 2019. Lo studio si sarebbe “limitato” al CFD, senza arrivare cioè alla comparazione delle due soluzioni con prototipi in galleria del vento.
Quale soluzione vedremo sulla Ferrari F1 2019 ancora non lo sappiamo anche se è probabile che “vinca” la quella più conservativa e nota del classico musetto visto nelle ultime tre stagioni a Maranello. Questo eviterebbe anche di introdurre qualche variabile in più per comprendere il comportamento in pista dell’intera monoposto, al di là del riscontro al CFD e in galleria del vento.

A cryptocurrency start-up that raised nearly $375,000 through an initial coin offering has disappeared with the funds. Confido billed itself as a company that is developing "smart contracts" to act as an escrow between a buyer and seller during a transaction of some sort. Traditional escrows would be held by a third party. But smart contracts are supposed to be fulfilled when both sides meet certain conditions, removing the need for that third party. The ICO took place earlier this month through a platform called TokenLot, which facilitates the fundraising. Nearly $375,000 was raised. Investors were given "contract for differences" tokens. These tokens traded as much as $1.20 on Nov. 14, but plunged following the disappearance of the Confido team to around 2 cents, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com.
'Legal trouble'
In the past few days, in what is being dubbed an "exit scam," online assets related to the Confido founders and the company have been deleted. The firm's website, Twitter account and Facebook page were erased. However, a cached version of the company's Medium post that was put online on Sunday still remains. In the post, the Confido team said it is in a "tight spot" due to "legal trouble" with a contract. "We signed the contract with assurance from our legal advisor that there was minimal risk and it would not be an issue. I can't and won't go into details, but he was wrong. It is a problem," the post says. It was reportedly authored by Joost van Doorn, CEO of Confido, but there is no trace of him online. A description of van Doorn on the cached version of Confido's website says that he has a master's degree in international business and has worked at firms such as eBay, PepsiCo and Zalando. CNBC has reached out to all three companies to see if they can verify van Doorn's claim. A person on Reddit who posted under the name "Chris-ConfidoSupport" claimed Monday to be a representative of Confido and said he has "absolutely no idea what has happened." The Redditor claimed to have been in contact with van Doorn for a "number of weeks" and this latest move is "completely out of character." Many people on Reddit questioned the credibility of the post and whether the person had actually met the CEO.
'Exit scam'
An ICO is the latest way for cryptocurrency start-ups to raise money by issuing their own digital tokens in exchange for a virtual currency like ether or bitcoin. Investors don't get a stake in the company, but the tokens they receive can be traded or used on a service provided by the platform. ICOs have exploded with more than $3.55 billion raised via this method so far this year. On Monday, TokenLot, the firm that hosted the ICO, put out a statement saying the Confido team had "pulled an exit scam." The Medium post said TokenLot's lines of communication with the cryptocurrency company had been closed and it doesn't have any more information outside what has been public. It said that Confido had shown all the required proof needed to list its ICO on the platform. However, TokenLot said that it was looking for clues to track down the Confido team. It said some of the ether tokens collected during the ICO had been sent to an account held with Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange. TokenLot added that it had been in contact with Bittrex and that it had confirmed the account that the ether was sent to an account where a "know your customer" check was authenticated. This is a process that is used to verify people are who they say they are online. TokenLot said that Bittrex's privacy policy requires a law enforcement request to release customer information, so it's in the process of filing a report to the FBI to ask the agency to help get the details. Bittrex did not reply to a CNBC request for comment via Twitter. TokenLot also said it had reached out to Kucoin, a Chinese exchange that listed the contract for differences token issued by Confido. Some people took to Reddit to slam KuCoin for not vetting the company properly. A spokesperson for KuCoin told CNBC on Tuesday: "In order to protect the interests of investors, Kucoin has suspended trading of CFD and are actively seeking contact with the CFD team. We have also started to implement an emergency loss prevention program to help reduce the losses of CFD token investors."

"If the Kucoin team is unable to contact the CFD team shortly, and re-enable normal trading, the final decision on trading stoppage will be made in a follow-up announcement on the website."
A lot of ICOs are 'fraud'
ICOs are currently unregulated in the majority of the world and banned in China and South Korea. This means that investors do not have any protection should an event like this take place. But many regulators are beginning to look into ICOs and trying to figure out how to deal with them. Authorities in Abu Dhabi recently released rules to bring ICOs into the regulatory fold. However, a number of people in the cryptocurrency and technology world have criticized ICOs. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by value, told CNBC in a recent interview that "a lot of what's happening in the ICO market is actually fraud." Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin told CNBC that there is "irrational exuberance" in the ICO market, although he believes the technology will mature and is here to stay.

University of Cape Town (UCT) researchers from the Industrial Computational Fluid Dynamics (InCFD) Research Group have made their mark in the field of international aircraft design, specifically the Airbus A320.
The groupâs novel CFD software Elemental â with its unprecedented accuracy â enabled Airbus to effect a design improvement to their A320 aircraft that won the research team the Best Innovations in Flight Physics award for 2017/18.
Based in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the InCFD research group is tasked with developing state-of-the-art CFD modelling technology and expertise to expressly support industry. Established in 2011 by Professor Arnaud Malan, its first task was to develop a new industrial strength Elemental CFD software version, which resulted in the awarding of the SARChI Chair in Industrial CFD in 2014.
Malan, who holds the SARChI Chair, worked on Elemental along with principal scientific officer Dr Leon Malan and postgraduate students Niran Ilangakoon and Bevan Jones. They cooperated with Francesco Gambioli, an expert in wing component loads, who managed the project for Airbus.
âUnprecedented accuracyâ
âThe unprecedented accuracy of Elemental allowed for a new level of understanding of fuel sloshing effects on the aircraft structure, resulting in a lighter and more optimised component of the inner fuel tank,â the professor explained.
âThe unprecedented accuracy of Elemental allowed for a new level of understanding of fuel sloshing effects on the aircraft structure.â
The award, which attracted several nominations, is presented annually in recognition of the best innovations in flight physics across all Airbus initiatives in Europe, the United States and India. The winners are elected via voting by all Airbus employees across all disciplines, as well as the flight physics expert community.
About 800 Airbus physics engineers are eligible to participate.
Malan said the fuel sloshing analysis ranked highly in terms of the votes from both employees and the experts.
The award nomination pointed to the novel CFD software being instrumental to the project.
Malan said this was testament to his groupâs motto of pursuing the development of state-of-the-art CFD tools for industry, âvia fundamental research which carries the hallmark of excellenceâ

Innovative technology developed in Formula 1 goes well beyond motorsport. It’s not all about winning the race, it’s also about supplying cutting-edge technologies to the wider world, for the benefit of everybody.
Managing airflow for energy efficiency
A silent revolution is coming to a supermarket near you. One that – though it’s effectively invisible as well as inaudible – could help slash the energy consumption of every major food retailer on the planet.
It’s happening thanks to advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology first developed to understand the airflow over racing cars and now being put to more practical use in the quest for better refrigeration efficiency.
In simple terms, the ‘super-fridge’ tech works by channeling low-temperature airflow more efficiently around those products which need cooling, while also dramatically reducing the amount of ‘cold-wash’ that spills uselessly – but expensively – to the floor from current chiller cabinets.
If the notion of ‘channeling airflow’ sounds familiar to any fan of motorsport, that’s because it is. The wings, bodywork, underfloor, radiator pods, brake ducts and so on that are an essential part of all high-end racing cars, work specifically to control the flow of air and create downforce – the key to making racing cars go faster around corners.
The gulf between one esoteric racing application for CFD and one of almost humdrum utility might seem vast, yet the underlying principles behind them are identical, explains Nick Wirth, founder of Wirth Research, now established as one of the world’s leading centers of CFD excellence. “We built a fridge simulation with a model using 300 million ‘cells’,” says Wirth, an ex-Formula 1 team technical director, “and that’s probably about the cell count that’s used in F1 now. So, it’s a very, very sophisticated model of a fridge.”
And the nature of CFD modeling, whereby computers create ‘real time’ visual representations of intricate aerodynamic movements, was fundamental to the component created by Wirth to improve refrigerator airflow: the ‘Ecoblade’. A simple, clip-on, device, it reduces energy wasted through unnecessary cooling by as much as 27 percent – as well as lessening the ‘freezing’ feeling familiar to any shopper passing through the chiller aisles.
Wirth’s expertise, which has also been used to model airflow inside the new landmark HQs of Apple and Bloomberg, is but one example of motorsport tech being applied to areas beyond racing. Their own portfolio encompasses defense and haulage industry projects, while those of household-name motorsport concerns, such as McLaren, Williams and Red Bull, take in a plethora of contracts for non-motorsport applications.
Air-traffic control
McLaren’s F1 race strategy technology, for example, became the basis for air-traffic control software now in use at Heathrow Airport. Through McLaren Applied Technologies (MAT) – a thriving off-shoot of a company that was once just a race-car manufacturer – simulation software created to monitor the location, position and speed of every car on the circuit was re-developed to perform a similar function for aircraft. The resulting Decision Insight platform enables air traffic controllers to optimize the flow of air and ground traffic, thereby reducing delays and jet engine emissions. Result: happier customers, less polluted air and an improved bottom-line for airlines, thanks to savings on fuel costs.
Cycling
McLaren’s expertise in aerodynamics and carbon-fiber manufacture, meantime, has been called upon by cycling giant Specialized to enhance the performance of their most exotic racing bikes, such as the Specialized S-Works+McLaren Venge. Taking the standard Venge model as a basis, McLaren’s enhanced version emerged 20 percent lighter and 11 percent stiffer than the original. Geoff McGrath, vice-president of MAT, says: “The bike has been winning races, and Specialized have a legitimate claim to say they have the fastest road bike in the world. It carries the McLaren brand partly because we’re proud of it, and partly because we expect it to be a high-performance benchmark.”
Red Bull Advanced Technologies, an affiliate company of the Red Bull F1 team, recently announced a similar technology-sharing partnership with Swiss premium cycle manufacturer BMC. “There are a huge number of parallels between cycling and motorsport, encompassing materials technology, aerodynamics, human performance analytics, as well as increasing use of electric power solutions,” says Red Bull F1 team boss, Christian Horner.
Aerospace
Impressive though all of these achievements are, perhaps none is quite so ambitious as the latest project announced by Williams Advanced Engineering, which will take technology developed at their Oxfordshire factory into space. WAE have begun work with Oxford Space Systems (OSS) to help develop a new generation of lightweight, unfurlable, boom arms and foldable antennae. These will be used on so-called nano-satellites that are lighter, less complex and cheaper than those currently in use. Their smaller scale presents a host of packaging and weight challenges – precisely the types of problem that are meat and drink to F1 engineers.
Their latest project is another feather in the cap for a division of Williams that has already worked in the automotive, aerospace, defense, health and energy sectors.
Proof, if it were needed, that there’s an awful lot more to modern motorsport than cars going round in circles. As Matthew Burkle, head of technology ventures at WAE notes: “There is a good fit between OSS technologies and our own expertise and it’s great to be able to explore additional ways in which we can work together on new discoveries.”
To boldly go, indeed…

Researchers from NUIG, Eindhoven University of Technology and KU Leuven have used advanced technologies such as engineering simulation and wind tunnel facilities to better understand and improve the complex aerodynamics of elite Paracycling tandem and handcycling disciplines

The importance and prestige of Paracycling is on the rise, but insight in Paracycling aerodynamics is very limited. Therefore, researchers from NUI Galway (Ireland), Eindhoven University of Technology (the Netherlands) and KU Leuven (Belgium) have used advanced technologies such as engineering simulation (Computational Fluid Dynamics – CFD) developed by ANSYS and wind tunnel facilities typically dedicated to aerospace, nuclear or automotive research to better understand and improve the complex aerodynamics of elite Paracycling tandem and handcycling disciplines.
Decisive gains can be achieved
The results show that decisive gains can be achieved by counter-intuitive postures and wheel selection that can change the outcomes in the Paracycling competitions in the games next year.
Dr Eoghan Clifford, NUI Galway, a four-time paracycling world champion and current Paralympic champion has joined forces with Professor Bert Blocken, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and KU Leuven, recognised worldwide for his expertise in elite cycling aerodynamics.
Surprised by the scarcity of scientific research performed on Paracycling where many fundamental insights are lacking, they decided to set up the first large open scientific research project into Paralympic cycling in collaboration with Drs Magdalena Hajdukiewicz (NUI Galway), Dr Yasin Toparlar (TU/e), Dr Thomas Andrianne (U Liège) and Dr Paul Mannion (who was jointly awarded a PhD by NUI Galway and TU/e for his work on this project).
The project combined computer simulation (CFD) with ANSYS software on Irish and Dutch supercomputers with wind tunnel testing in the wind tunnels of Eindhoven University of Technology and the University of Liège. The investigation focused on both tandem cycling and H1-H4 handcycling.
Four key findings
This investigation resulted in four key new findings. Applying these findings in races would yield significant gains in terms of time. In recent top races at Rio 2016, the difference between gold and silver or missing the podium was often a matter of seconds:
1.) Tandem cycling: Men – 4km pursuit (Rio velodrome) – Gold to Silver (1.6 seconds); Bronze to 4th place (0.9 seconds).
2.) Tandem cycling: Men 30km time trial (Rio road) – Gold to Silver 8.8 seconds.
3.) Tandem cycling: Women – Tandem 3km pursuit (Rio velodrome) – Gold to Silver (3.5 seconds). In qualifying 0.8 seconds separated the third place position from the 5th place position (3rd and 4th quality for a medal ride off).
4.) Tandem cycling: Women 30km time trial (Rio road) – Silver to Bronze 0.8 seconds.
5.) Handcycling: Men 20km time trial (Rio road) – Gold to Silver in some cases was as low as 2 seconds and 10 seconds with silver to bronze being as low as 0.9 seconds in one category.
Significant differences in time
The research resulted in four key new findings that are generally opposite to what Paracyclists and their entourage would expect and that in race circumstances can make very significant differences in time:
1.) The typical time-trial setup with a time-trial handlebar for the pilot and the stoker does not provide the lowest aerodynamic resistance. The stoker holding the seatpost of the tandem bicycle (frame-clench setup) provides a gain of 8.1s over a 10km race.
2.) The most aerodynamic race setup of the tandem cyclists is not the one where pilot and stoker bodies are closest to the horizontal. The pilot being slightly more upright gives a benefit of 6.5s over 10km.
3.) The most aerodynamic wheel choice for a H1-H4 handcycle is not disk wheels at the rear, as commonly accepted, but two spoked wheels at the rear, because disk wheels would channel the flow between these wheels and create extra suction (drag) on the cyclist body. Spoked wheels at the rear and a single disk wheel at the front would save 16 s on 10km.
4.) For downhill handcycling, athletes tend to adopt the so-called 6 o’clock position, with the hands in the lowest position and the arms tucked against the body. The 9 o’clock position with hands farthest upstream has a 4.3 per cent lower drag, which gives a gain of 0.8s over a 500m descent.
As a four-time paracycling world champion and current Paralympic champion, Dr Clifford has corroborated these findings and with the research team and high performance coaches has tested athletes and used the findings to guide these athletes towards better performances.
Dr Clifford, College of Engineering and Informatics, NUI Galway, said: “This has been one of the most exciting and challenging projects I have worked on. The extensive experimental and computational modelling work was unprecedented for Paralympic cycling and indeed for most sports.
“The work will fundamentally impact Paralympic cycling and will cause teams and engineers to rethink their approach to aerodynamics. This work also opens the door for world-class Paralympic athletes to have the same expertise and equipment available to them as other professional athletes.
“At the world championships and Paralympics where tenths of seconds can decide medals this work can unlock that vital time.”
Professor Bert Blocken, Eindhoven University of Technology and KU Leuven, said: “I am passionate about Sports aerodynamics because it really pushes the boundaries of computer simulation and wind tunnel testing. In most topics on aerodynamics, accuracies of five to 10 per cent are considered sufficient.
“In sports aerodynamics however, tenths or even hundredths of percentages can be decisive. This first extensive open project in Paralympic cycling reveals new insights to obtain such gains in these competitions.”
Engineering simulation leader
Thierry Marchal, global industry director sports and healthcare, ANSYS, said: “As the engineering simulation leader, ANSYS is keen to assist the sport community improving safety and performance of athletes by adopting a technology traditionally used in the aerospace and automotive industries. Elite sport is an ideal window to illustrate the impact of pervasive simulation across all industries.”
Paralympics Ireland CEO Miriam Malone said: “I would like to congratulate the research team on the publication of this fantastic research. The results published will fundamentally change the approach that many paracyclists take to their sports and will ensure that more exciting times lie ahead as performances improve.
“It is particularly pleasing that Paralympics Ireland board member and Paralympic champion, Dr Eoghan Clifford, is spearheading this research project.”
Neill Delahaye, national performance coach, Cycling Ireland, said: “Cycling Ireland has had significant international success in Track Cycling and Road Cycling over recent years.
“To compete with the world’s top nations, we actively engage with research and innovation. From the outset we recognised this work could have significant benefits for our athletes especially given aerodynamics plays such a key role in cycling.”

Engineers must manage a maelstrom in the core of operating nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactions deposit an extraordinary amount of heat in the fuel rods, setting off a frenzy of boiling, bubbling, and evaporation in surrounding fluid. From this churning flow, operators harness the removal of heat.
In search of greater efficiencies in nuclear systems, scientists have long sought to characterize and predict the physics underlying these processes of heat transfer, with only modest success.
But now a research team led by Emilio Baglietto, an associate professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT, has made a significant breakthrough in detailing these physical phenomena. Their approach utilizes a modeling technology called computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Baglietto has developed new CFD tools that capture the fundamental physics of boiling, making it possible to track rapidly evolving heat transfer phenomena at the microscale in a range of different reactors, and for different operating conditions.
“Our research opens up the prospect of advancing the efficiency of current nuclear power systems and designing better fuel for future reactor systems,” says Baglietto.
The group, which includes Etienne Demarly, a doctoral candidate in nuclear science and engineering, and Ravikishore Kommajosyula, a doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering and computation, describes its work in the March 11 issue of Applied Physics Letters.
Baglietto, who arrived at MIT in 2011, is thermal hydraulics lead for the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Lightwater Reactors (CASL), an initiative begun in 2010 to design predictive modeling tools to improve current and next generation reactors, and to ensure the economic viability of nuclear energy as an electricity source.
Central to Baglietto’s CASL work has been the issue of critical heat flux (CHF), which “represents one of the grand challenges for the heat transfer community,” he says. CHF describes a condition of boiling where there is a sudden loss of contact between the bubbling liquid, and the heating element, which in the case of the nuclear industry is the nuclear fuel rod. This instability can emerge suddenly, in response to changes in power levels, for example. As boiling reaches a crisis, a vaporous film covers the fuel surface, which then gives way to dry spots that quickly reach very high temperatures.
“You want bubbles forming and departing from the surface, and water evaporating, in order to take away heat,” explains Baglietto. “If it becomes impossible to remove the heat, it is possible for the metal cladding to fail.”
Nuclear regulators have established power settings in the commercial reactor fleet whose upper limits are well beneath levels that might trigger CHF. This has meant running reactors below their potential energy output.
“We want to allow as much boiling as possible without reaching CHF,” says Baglietto. “If we could know how far we are at all times from CHF, we could operate just on the other side, and improve the performance of reactors.”
Achieving this, says Baglietto, requires better modeling of the processes leading to CHF. “Previous models were based on clever guesses, because it was impossible to see what was actually going on at the surface where boiling took place, and because models didn’t take into account all the physics driving CHF,” says Baglietto.
So he set out to create a comprehensive, high-fidelity representation of boiling heat transfer processes up to the point of CHF. This meant creating physically accurate models of the movement of bubbles, boiling, and condensation taking place at what engineers call "the wall" — the cladding of four meter-tall, one centimeter-wide nuclear fuel rods, which are packed by the tens of thousands in a typical nuclear reactor core and surrounded by hot fluid.
While some of Baglietto’s computational models took advantage of existing knowledge of the complex fuel assembly heat transfer processes inside reactors, he also sought new experimental data to validate his models. He enlisted the help of department colleagues Matteo Bucci, the Norman C. Rasmussen Assistant Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering, and Jacopo Buongiorno, the TEPCO Professor and associate department head for nuclear science and engineering.
Using electrically simulated heaters with surrogate fuel assemblies and transparent walls, MIT researchers were able to observe the fine details in the evolution of boiling to CHF.
“You’d go from a situation where nice little bubbles removed a lot of heat, and new water re-flooded the surface, keeping things cold, to an instant later when suddenly there was no more space for bubbles and dry spots would form and grow,” says Baglietto.
One fundamental corroboration emerged from these experiments. Baglietto’s initial models, contrary to conventional thinking, had suggested that during boiling, evaporation is not the exclusive form of heat removal. Simulation data showed that bubbles sliding, jostling and departing from the surface removed even more heat than evaporation, and experiments validated the findings of the models.
“Baglietto’s work represents a landmark in the evolution of predictive capabilities for boiling systems, enabling us to model behaviors at a much more fundamental level than ever possible before,” says W. David Pointer, group leader of advanced reactor engineering at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who was not involved in the research. “This research will allow us to develop significantly more aggressive designs that better optimize the power produced by fuel without compromising on safety, and it will have an immediate impact on performance in the current fleet as well as on next-generation reactor design.”
Baglietto’s research will also quickly improve the process for developing nuclear fuels. Instead of spending many months and millions of dollars on experiments, says Pointer, “We can shortcut those long sequences of tests by providing accurate, reliable models.”
In coming years, Baglietto’s comprehensive approach may help deliver fuel cladding that is more resistant to fouling and impurities, more accident tolerant, and that encourages higher wettability, making surfaces more conducive to contact with water and less likely to form dry spots.
Even small improvements in nuclear energy output can make a big difference, Baglietto says.
“If fuel performs five percent better in an existing reactor, that means five percent more energy output, which can mean burning less gas and coal,” he says. “I hope to see our work very soon in U.S. reactors, because if we can produce more nuclear energy cheaply, reactors will remain competitive against other fuels, and make a greater impact on CO 2 emissions."
The research was supported by the Department of Energy’s Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors.

Willem Toet explains…the 2019 F1 aerodynamic dilemma
So, the F1 season is underway. Most of the main protagonists are still there but there have certainly been a few surprises. I have been inspired to write this, perhaps a little earlier than I had originally envisaged, because I have been reading some truth and rather a lot of invented fiction about these 2019 cars. Together, the rule makers (the FIA) and Formula One Management (FOM) are collaborating on rules for the longer term. I fully expect these to be a significant step in the direction of making overtaking easier, hopefully without the need for a false overtaking aid (the DRS). Aerodynamic experts, most of us that is, have long believed that good aerodynamic downforce combined with the ability to race is possible. The reality of F1 in the last 20 years appears to be proving this to be untrue. I believe however! Given the challenges faced particularly since the introduction of the 2017 rules, the 2019 rules were devised in the interim to try to halt the obvious damage to the ability of the cars to overtake. For 2017/18 changes were made which we knew would make overtaking more challenging. So how do we know? In the lead up to what became the 2009 regulations (delayed due to insufficient time from the original plan of 2008) specific research was done into the aerodynamics of following cars. This research was paid for by the now defunct Formula One Teams Association (FOTA), in other words it was paid for by the teams. Several items made overtaking harder. These included low wide rear wings and powerful bargeboards. The 2017 rules put these items back onto the cars.
Two small-scale models were tested in the wind tunnel (Fondech) where each model was modified identically, and the forces measured with and without a second model in front of the primary model (that is the one behind). I was lucky enough to be the key player (Head of Aerodynamics) in the discussions on this research on behalf of the BMW Sauber team. Changes that were made for 2017 allowed freedoms and made changes that, from the research done 10 years earlier, were clearly going to make it more difficult to follow closely. We ignored the lessons of history and paid the price with the additional challenges that drivers faced when getting close to the car in front. For 2019 the fact that teams play a pivotal role in the creation of the regulations has led to a set of regulations that were always going to struggle to achieve their objectives of improving overtaking. A positive from these rules is a more powerful drag reduction system (DRS). This will certainly help. A negative is that the front wing regulations box has been enlarged so much that teams have freedom to use only part of the box to generate their downforce. Consequently, teams have returned to the game of punching the front wheel wake far outside the periphery of the car in order to generate more downforce. As with every new regulation change, the theoretical performance of the cars has evolved quickly (in CFD and in the wind tunnel). So the intent of the rules has effectively been circumvented.
Thanks to Nicolas Perrin for creating the car geometry and to Creo Dynamics for the simulation. This diagram shows the wake just at the back of the “Perrinn” 2017 “F1” model. The white dashed lines are roughly where the equivalent wake of a more developed 2017 car is likely to have been. Nick Perrinn has released this geometry into the public domain – a service that makes it possible for non-experts to dig into the aerodynamics of recent F1 cars. I would like to show you the wake around a real F1 car and, if I did, it would have a wider low-down wake outside the wheels but also a more powerful upwash coming from the rear wing. The upwash will tend to suck the majority of the wake of any car up into the air and much of it will flow above the following car. Unfortunately though, the front wheel/tyre wake is punched outboard so aggressively with all of these cars that it stays low and has a detrimental impact on following cars.
4 metres behind the car and a big part of the wake is going higher than the car, but regrettably a lot of the wake stays wide. The car shape can be seen ghosted into the picture. The wake of a real 2017 car would look like the dashed white lines. The wake of a 2018 car would be wider but also stretched taller. Showing the wake of a 2019 car is not something I’m prepared to do. When the 2019 regulations were being discussed, the teams, as usual, tried their best to argue for changes they believed might be beneficial to themselves. Experience has taught me that the short-term and selfish needs of each team dictate the way they explain motivation for or against the regulations. Engineering truth and health of the sport overall is virtually never successful when the teams have to vote. The exception, I must state, is matters relating to safety. So, when the outwashing end plates and turning vanes were eliminated by a push from the rule makers, the teams requested more volume to recover the lost downforce. Every aerodynamicist in F1 will have known that the lost elements did not create (significant) front downforce; they managed the tyre wake creating a large vortex that brought high energy flow back into the area of the barge boards which in turn allowed more downforce to be generated further back on the car. The new regulatory box for the front wing is significantly wider and taller than the old one. This has allowed teams to return to the game of creating outwash. My belief is that the outwash on the 2019 cars is not smaller averaged over the grid than it was in 2018. For certain teams, the 2019 cars have a larger outwash than those of 2018, which then allows the cars to produce more downforce. The cars are heavier this year due to the regulations, but they are faster. Now to the large range of designs used by the different teams on front wing design. One cannot cover every aspect and, as an expert, I know that it is dangerous to predict which design will ultimately prove to be the best for individual car performance. Let us keep things simple. Expansion and front downforce generation using the inboard parts of the front wing will have the following consequences. Less air will travel past the front wing to the area behind the front wheels where teams locate their variously-named barge boards. A powerful Y250 vortex remains and still provides energy to the barge board area. With this inboard “blockage”, more air will flow outboard towards the front wheel where even the small angle now permitted on the front wing end plate (FWEP) will directly create significant outwash. Further tricks to create more outwash are on the way; some already being used in Melbourne. Then consider this. The front wings are now back to being as wide as the overall vehicle. Therefore front wing losses and potential outboard damage to front wings is likely. If most of your front downforce is generated outboard, it is likely you will lose more of that downforce if you damage your FWEP. No matter how the spanwise lift distribution is organised, there will still be a massively powerful series of vortices which add up to the so-called Y250 vortex, which will take flow nominally aiming to pass around beside the driver and rotate some of that flow down into the area that can be used by the barge boards. For the teams generating the majority of their front wing downforce outboard, a little less direct outwash can be created at the end plate, but more air is directly available to the barge board area so that the front wheel wake can be controlled from behind the wheel more and from in front of it a little less. Both conceptual designs can be evolved to generate more downforce with the front of the car as total downforce levels increase due to the evolution of the designs. There is still a lot of front wing “box” available. So, my question to all of you budding aerodynamic experts is: do the teams all investigate the opposite solution to the one they currently run? If they do, what are the consequences?
The 2009 and 2008 BMW Sauber cars as at Rollout for 2009. Rather different looking cars for rather different aerodynamic regulations. In 2009, F1 allowed energy recovery systems (KERS) to be used for the first time. These systems allowed any team running them to gain a theoretical 0.25 seconds/lap advantage and to have a strategic (potential overtaking) advantage by using up the energy and deploying it all in one overtaking manoeuvre rather than spreading its use out over a single lap. I argued vociferously not to have the KERS on the BMW Sauber. The strength of my conviction, and quite possibly the way that I argued, ultimately lost me my job.
Every team that decided to fit an ERS went backwards in 2009. So why? ERS added a huge research load on many departments including the aerodynamics department of the teams choosing to run the system. This, combined with the dramatic rule changes on the aerodynamics themselves in 2009, was why I wanted to give up that “advantage”. There was more to gain having a conventional car and working on the aerodynamics.
As a resource planner your main role is to deploy resources where they are most useful. You expect a reasonable development curve that will look like one of these curves once it is smoothed out.
With the changes to the aerodynamic regulations for 2009 this is what I explained would be the result with KERS. Aero research cut to about 60% would mean a loss of 0.7 seconds compared to deploying the whole department’s energy into rules optimisation rather than use 40% of the department on KERS-related work. The truth was that gains made by all teams in the run up to 2009 were larger than expected. Thus the gain for adding research capability (i.e. using the whole department) was also bigger than I had predicted. I then made a really large mistake. My people, knowing very well that non-KERS was the way to go, begged and pushed me to let them do some research into a non-KERS package. Eventually I relented. We made gains but the fundamental unchangable design philosophy of the car could not be changed and the gains were not big enough. This then, was a waste of time and took away from that final performance of the car. Looking back I kick myself for this mistake. In 2012 a few early adapters discovered that you could use the Coanda effect to circumvent a new regulation which pushed the exhaust gas uphill and away from the floor of the cars. We discovered early that aerodynamic evolution created a diverging path for car shape depending upon the use or not of a Coanda exhaust system.
I polled my department heads and influencers about the best direction. Everyone bar one said Coanda exhaust would be fastest. Most, however, wanted to research both, just in case. It was clear that the gains from using the exhaust for performance were so large that even drivability disadvantages would be overcome. The step in performance available, especially coming out of low and medium speed corners was huge. So, remembering the lessons from the past, I pushed both my people and my bosses in the direction of making one choice. It was another fight, a really big fight, but I’m not afraid of a fight.
For 2019, I would suggest that, for most teams, staying with their present car concept is likely to give them the best 2019 result. If you were the boss of a F1 team and you had to decide whether to change direction and investigate a new concept or not, you have to consider the consequences of that choice. To give the alternative concept a fighting chance, you have to apply a significant proportion of your always limited resources to studying that concept. Remember that changing to the new concept may require a new nose design. That means a new crash test which brings its own risk. Redeploying resources necessarily removes resources from your previous concept and hence reduces your rate of development on your original concept. Consequently, if the new concept is wrong, you have crippled the development rate on the best concept. If the new concept is the best one, you are at least six months behind everybody else who is developing that concept. Result: you are going to have a bad season. The chassis is too hard to change and may already cause a compromise further crippling a potential change of direction. One has to be both arrogant and brave to change – it can work but usually does not. After the tests in Barcelona, learned opinion suggested that, for whatever reasons, Ferrari had got it right. Post-Melbourne, it is clear that Mercedes had actually got the best package/setup for that event. Over the next races we get a more balanced picture of where the cars and drivers really stand.
But, if you want to know which concept is best, perhaps our friends at Red Bull (not the team but the sponsor) are in the best position to ferret around and find the answer. They sponsor a car with each concept.

Shares in online contracts for difference (CFD) and cryptocurrency trading platform Plus500 (PLUS) have collapsed by 39% to 992p after the company cut it outlook for sales and earnings this year.
Despite strong gains in revenue and profit last year, the company sees turnover this year below market forecasts and warns that profit is likely to be âmaterially lower than current market expectationsâ.
PERFORMANCE MADE IT AN OUTLIER
Plus500âs shares have had a stellar run, gaining 160% in 2017 and more than 50% last year making it one of the best performing stocks on the London market.
As we said in December however, it seemed unlikely to be able to repeat the trick for a third year given that new European rules were impacting revenue growth.
Sure enough the company says that its âlatest assessment of the impact of the ESMA regulatory measuresâ is the reason it has cut its sales outlook.
This, combined with a high level of marketing spend which arguably the company needs to maintain in order to keep its market share, mean that earnings will be well below forecasts.
MOMENTUM RAN OUT
When companies consistently beat expectations, and their share prices rise in response, investors start to expect them to beat every quarter.
Plus500 repeatedly raised forecasts last year despite evidence from rivals that the ESMA rules were impacting trading, and investors went along with it.
At some point sales and earnings were bound to run out of momentum and the shares were going to be punished.
A quick look at earnings forecasts for this year shows that most analysts stopped raising their estimates back in October and since then one or two had actually cut their numbers.
WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY?
âIf it looks too good to be true, it probably is. That is certainly the moral of the story with Plus500 which has issued a major profit warning because of tighter European regulation around the types of trading instruments it markets to retail investors,â says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
âPlus500 has looked like an anomaly for some time. While its peer group have all had to downgrade earnings expectations because of tighter rules on contracts-for-difference â a high-risk way of betting on stocks, currencies, commodities and cryptocurrencies â Plus500 delivered a series of statements that kept saying it would beat earnings forecasts. Its run of good luck has come to an abrupt halt.â
Mould says owning Plus500 shares has effectively equated to taking a double dose of risk. âFirstly, youâve had the risk of your money being in the stock market. Secondly, your money has gone into a business which operates in high-risk products.â
He adds: âIn good times, investors will have sought superior returns. But in bad times, like now, investors will have to sadly stomach chunky losses. It provides a stark reminder for investors to know exactly what they are getting themselves into.â
EARNINGS DOWNGRADES
Liberum has pushed through large downgrades to its earnings forecasts. Adjusted pre-tax profit estimates have been slashed by 18% to $268m which is significantly less than the $503m achieved in 2018. The broker also reduces its 2020 pre-tax profit forecast by 18% to $340m.
Shareholders may also have to stomach a large drop in the dividend with Liberum slashing its 2019 forecast by 54% to 83p and reducing 2020âs estimate by 46% to 106p.

Story 183
In the run-up to August of last year, many in the retail trading industry proclaimed that “going multi-asset” would be necessary for any broker that wanted to survive the fallout from the European Securities and Markets Authority’s product intervention measures.
Of course, some brokers claim that they have a set of ‘multi-asset’ products when, in reality, they are just offering CFDs on a number of different asset classes. But, over the past twelve months, there has been much talk about brokers adding real stock trading to their set of products.

Some brokers have actually managed to do this. Along with a highly publicized marketing campaign, eToro launched a commission-free stock trading service in May. Other brokers, such as IG Group, Trading 212, ThinkMarkets, and RoboMarkets also offer traders access to equities markets.
For the most part, however, brokers haven’t managed to add stock trading to their platforms. There is a good reason for this – providing equities trading to clients is time-consuming, bureaucratic, and expensive.
Dealing with data
One of the biggest problems firms face is market data. Like many other financial institutions, retail brokers are finding that licensing data from exchanges is both expensive and, from a legal point of view, complex.
“Exchanges are now very aware of the retail trading industry and have changed their approach by introducing targeted and specific new policies and license fees,” said Rafah Hanah, a former executive at the London Stock Exchange who now provides market data consulting services to brokers.
“Previously, a flat Derived Data Licence Fee was sufficient, and pre-audits were not undertaken. Now exchanges, including the LSE, are undertaking pre-audits to ensure, prior to licensing a broker, that their derived data is not able to be reverse engineered, and the onward distribution of data is appropriately licensed, especially for B2B API redistribution and white labels.”
That final point is particularly significant for brokers that want to add either single-stock CFDs or real equities to their offering.
Even if they only want to offer the CFD product, white label brokers will still have to contend with an exchange’s market data policy. They either have to license data directly from an exchange or through the broker that they are a white label of.
Brokers that want to offer real stock trading are almost guaranteed to have to reach some sort of white label agreement with another firm.
That’s because, with a very small number of exceptions, they are not exchange members – the only people that can access an exchange directly. As a result, they have to work with another broker to access the markets they want.
“Some of our clients are looking into [adding equities] and are finding that the best they can do is set up a white label with Interactive Brokers,” said a senior executive at one liquidity provider. “But even that isn’t ideal as it brings a number of technological problems with it.”
No platform
One of those problems is the trading platform. Some brokers want to connect their clients to equities trading via MetaTrader 5. There’s nothing wrong with that but, from a purely functional point of view, MT5 is not entirely suited to equities trading.
“MT5 is just not ideal for trading in the stock market,” said the liquidity provider executive. “Take something really basic like a search function. On MT5, you cannot look up a company name – the platform only lists a stock’s symbol. So, if I want to trade in a particular stock, I have to find its symbol online then go back to MT5 and look for it.”
Of course, many brokers are not even using MT5. As the Finance Magnates intelligence team has shown, MT4 is still ubiquitous amongst brokers, and they don’t seem likely to relinquish their hold on the platform any time soon.
Trading stocks with MT4 is possible via a bridge provider but, again, the platform was not designed to give users direct access to the equities markets.
From principal to agent
Aside from any problems they experience with their trading platform, brokers adding stocks to their offering would need to make a huge shift in their set of operations.
As much as they like to claim that they are 100 percent ECN, straight-through processing, direct market access, no dealing-desk brokers, most retail trading firms are actually zero percent ECN, have no through processing, do not provide direct market access and operate a dealing desk.
Conversely, providing your clients with shares means you have to provide them with ownership in a share. Thus, it becomes much harder to simply b-book your client base into oblivion.
“Most match-principal brokers have set up their trading systems, back-office software and reporting methods to fit with that particular trading model,” said Norbert Lukasiewicz, an eFX consultant to major financial institutions and a former executive at technology provider Integral.

“But offering DMA equities requires the end-client to be an owner of the purchased stock. That means that the typical matched-principal setup must be replaced by an agency model where the broker is transmitting orders on behalf of its clients.”
Struggling to keep up
Even if they were able to shift their operations to act as stockbrokers, there is also the question of speed. CFD brokers do provide reasonably fast execution times to their clients. FXCM, for example, generally executes its clients’ orders in under 20 milliseconds.
The problem is that many exchanges are dealing in microseconds, not milliseconds. Thus, even if CFD brokers are providing a good service to clients now, that may not translate well into stock trading on exchanges.
This latency issue is compounded by the fact that there is less liquidity on stock exchanges. Brokers can effectively generate CFD liquidity on demand through a b-book model. They cannot do the same for stocks.
“Exchanges are central limit order books and essentially have a limited supply of liquidity,” added Lukasiewicz. “Because of that, speed becomes extremely important as it increases your chances of getting your order executed at the desired price.
“But CFD brokers are used to milliseconds latency, whereas the exchange world is operating in microseconds. To put it simply, the tech used for CFD trading may not be quick enough for trading equities. If that’s the case, it will result in slow market data and ultimately a very high ratio of slippage on execution.”
Lack of knowledge
Technological and operational structures may hinder brokers’ efforts to add equities trading to their service offering, but there’s also a human component. Most retail trading executives are not stockbrokers, and only a small number have experience in that particular field.
“I think any CFD firm adding stock trading facilities may need to recruit a new team across different departments to deal with the new asset class they are looking to offer,” said Salam Alaswad, the CEO of London-based retail broker Citypoint. “At a minimum, they would have to provide enhanced and thorough training for their existing employees.”
Whether training existing employees or bringing in staff would be enough is also up for debate. That’s because CFD brokers wouldn’t just be competing against one another for market share in the stockbroking business – there are already a huge number of banks and investment firms offering the service.
Almost every bank in the UK, for example, offers its retail customers access to a share dealing platform. That includes comparatively smaller firms like the Yorkshire Building Society, as well as digital newcomers like Revolut.
Aside from those offerings, there are also existing investment platforms that have decades of experience behind them. Charles Stanley and Hargreaves Landsdown, two large UK firms, both allow retail clients to invest in the stock market.
“For the average person, I think an investment platform offered by a bank is going to be much more convenient,” said the liquidity provider executive.
“There are a very small number of firms active in the CFD space – I can count them on one hand – that provide an appealing investment service. Aside from them, I can’t see why anyone would want to move their investments to a CFD broker.”
One euro trades
Even if a retail trading firm was able to overcome all of these different problems and start offering its clients access to the stock market, there would be another very simple hurdle to it being successful – stockbroking doesn’t make you that much money.
In a three month period, many brokers can expect to make an average of around $1,000 from their clients. That figure can be exponentially higher for some traders.
The same is not true for stock trading. Equities investors trade far less frequently and, as you cannot b-book them, it is much harder to squeeze money out of them.
When you then take into account data fees and compliance costs, making money becomes much harder unless you have a gigantic customer base. One broker executive that Finance Magnates spoke to said that equities trading could be worth as little as 1 euro ($1.11) per trade, with many clients only making one or two trades per quarter.
“Generally speaking, CFDs are very lucrative products for those firms offering them,” noted Alaswad. “Adding much less lucrative products, dealing with the hassle of changing and amending all of your systems and controls may not be seen as a sensible option for many firms. In reality, I think that many traditional equity brokers are the ones looking to offer CFDs.”
Taking this all into account, it’s easy to see why, one year after ESMA introduced its restrictive regulations, many brokers haven’t even considered adding equities trading to their offering.
Costly, competitive, expensive, and full of legal hoops to jump through, for many firms, there would likely only be some cross-selling value to be gained by adding stocks to their set of products.
That being the case, we may see a few more brokers add stock trading to their list of services in the near future but don’t expect the whole industry to go ‘multi-asset’ any time soon.

Story 184
Wood-burning fireplaces, enjoyed by man and man’s best friend alike, must be designed to minimize harmful emissions. (Image courtesy of Stove Builder International.)
Nothing beats the pleasant crackling and gentle warmth of a dancing wood-fueled flame. As you settle into your hearthside armchair at the end of a long day, the last thing you want to worry about is the amount of particulate matter being emitted by your wood-burning fireplace. Is the smoke rising from your chimney as clean as it should be?
Worry not, because wood-fueled appliance manufacturers like Stove Builder International (SBI) worry for you. SBI manufactures wood and pellet fueled fireplaces, stoves and furnaces for the international market. We spoke with Guillaume Thibodeau-Fortin, a mechanical engineer and designer for SBI, to talk about how the company uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to ensure its products are as clean as possible.
Minimizing Particulate Matter
SBI’s range of solid-fuel burning appliances produce heat by burning either wood or pellets made of compressed organic matter. However, heat isn’t the only product of this reaction. The smoke from wood- and pellet-burning stoves and fireplaces contains gases like carbon dioxide and monoxide, as well as solid or liquid particulate matter, tiny particles just 2.5 to 10 microns in size.
Particulate matter (PM) ranges from 2.5 to 10 microns in size, much smaller than a human hair or grain of sand. (Image courtesy of EPA.)
Particulate matter is not particularly healthy to have in one’s lungs, so it won’t come as much of a surprise that there are regulations surrounding its emission. In the United States, particulate matter emissions are currently limited to no more than 4.5 grams per hour. However, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tightening those restrictions to just 2.5 grams per hour in 2020.
To cope with the regulatory changes, SBI needed to revamp its considerable product line, and the company only had five years to do so. Though that sounds like plenty of time, as Thibodeau-Fortin explained, it could have been a close call.
“In the past, in order to do five fireboxes [the part of the fireplace or stove where the fire burns], it took probably five years. It was maybe three to four prototypes before the certification. Now we’re able to do one or two prototypes before being able to run a certification test,” he said.
So what changed? SBI turned to simulation to accelerate the design process. The company used Siemens’ FloEFD for Solid Edge, a CFD analysis tool integrated within its design software, to better analyze and optimize their designs.
Refining Design with FloEFD
One option to help reduce harmful emission in wood-burning products is to include a device called a catalytic combustor, which helps reduce the temperature necessary for gases to burn. However, according to Thibodeau-Fortin, catalytic combustors are fragile and difficult for end users to maintain, so SBI doesn’t use them. In order to reduce the particulate matter emissions of its appliances, SBI had no choice but to tweak its designs into compliance.
This tweaking was accomplished through the use of FloEFD. Though the CFD software doesn’t offer a direct method of determining the particulate matter emissions of a design, it can offer insight into emission quantity. Thibodeau-Fortin used data for wood gas flow to run a combustion simulation on SBI’s firebox designs. Though the simulations were intensive—10 hours of simulation for five minutes of real-time combustion—the analysis revealed the amount of residuals left in the chimney. The amount of residuals is an indicator of the amount of particulate matter emissions, with more residuals indicating more emissions.
SBI used FloEFD to simulate and optimize their stove and fireplace designs. (Image courtesy of SBI.)
With this feedback, Thibodeau-Fortin was able to tune the design in the direction of less residuals and, hence, less emissions.
“The combustion alters depending on how I tune my primary and secondary air intakes, the pilot and all those type of air intakes,” he said. “I looked at plenty of parameters in the flue pipe, and that's how I compared a wood stove that was quite dirty to one that was pretty clean. I got closer and closer to what a clean stove should be. At the end, I could do maybe 20 or 30 modifications without having to weld anything. So it helped a lot on the prototyping.”
Since starting to use FloEFD to modify designs, SBI has certified five new fireboxes in line with the 2020 requirements, which encompass three models of wood stoves, two models of fireplaces and two models of pellet stoves. Only a few fireboxes remain to be certified to complete SBI’s product portfolio.
Integrated CFD Analysis
Siemens acquired FloEFD in 2016 with the company’s acquisition of Mentor Graphics, allowing for even tighter integration with Siemens’ CAD applications Solid Edge and NX. FloEFD is embedded directly within the application, meaning there’s no need to transfer CAD models into a standalone CFD solver. That said, FloEFD is available in a standalone version to those who need it.
The tight integration of FloEFD within CAD programs encourages engineers to frontload their CFD analysis. FloEFD wants users to take advantage of CFD early on in the design process, rather than sending a nearly finished model to a CFD analyst late in the game. This means CFD can take a guiding role in the design, as it did for SBI. To the same end, FloEFD is designed to be user friendly, accessible even to users lacking a PhD in turbulence modeling.
“It’s quite user-friendly software,” Thibodeau-Fortin said. “It’s made for a non-expert of CFD, and that helps a lot.”
For his own training, Thibodeau-Fortin went through the tutorials that come packaged with FloEFD. He had also taken a few CFD and finite element analysis (FEA) classes during his undergraduate degree, which gave him some familiarity with the process. However, he found little information on simulating combustion, which is what he needed to do for SBI. He was fortunate that a former professor of his happened to be working on combustion simulations and was able to guide Thibodeau-Fortin.
Naturally, there’s always more to learn. Thibodeau-Fortin plans to complete further training with a company specializing in combustion and heat transfer simulations. The additional training will help him tackle even more wood-burning fireplace designs, as SBI, pleased with the benefits of FloEFD, will continue to simulate its appliances for a more detailed understanding of their performance.
In the meantime, you can rest easy knowing that there’s a little less particulate matter floating around out there, thanks to FloEFD and Thibodeau-Fortin’s design efforts.

Story 185
In this series of detailed technical images, F1i's Nicolas Carpentiers tells us which part of Haas VF-18 is 'American made' while also reviewing the many new technical innovations evaluated by Ferrari, whose development has followed a series of highs and lows, and by Mercedes.
MELTING POT
The Haas VF18 and the Ferrari SF71H are close cousins. The US team uses a provision in the technical regulations that allows it to buy many parts for its chassis from Maranello.
The cars of Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen are designed in Italy: it is sculpted in the wind tunnel of Maranello by Ben Agathangelou, a former Ferrari and Red Bull aerodynamicist, then assembled at Dallara's factory in Parma. Finally, it's run from England, at the Banbury base bought from Marussia.
According to Appendix 6 of the Sporting Regulations, a team must build the monocoque, the survival cell, the deformable structures (i.e, the nose sections and the rear crash structure attached to the gearbox, amongst other things), the roll hoops, the wings, the floor, the diffuser and the bodywork (that is to say, all the parts and surfaces that interact with the air flow).
In the case of Haas, it is Dallara who produces these elements, in its Italian factory. Eighty engineers are "rented" to the Italian manufacturer under the direction of technical boss Rob Taylor, who previously worked at Arrows, Ferrari, Jaguar, Red Bull, McLaren and Marussia.
In this transcontinental puzzle, one piece is 100% American: the CFD (Computational Fluid Design) office, based in Kannapolis, North Carolina, in the same building as the NASCAR Stewart-Haas Racing team. Complimentary tools in the development of the aerodynamic shapes and forms, the CFD office and the wind tunnel (based in Maranello) are thus separated by the Atlantic Ocean, which is not ideal:
“The negatives are that we aren’t co-located with the aerodynamicists, would be the ideal situation, Haas F1 CFD aerodynamicist Charles Jenckes told Racer. But the positives are that we’re a key technology group that’s located in the U.S., which gives us a U.S. presence for the team where really the rest of the technical aspects of the team are not in the U.S. at all.
“We’re also changing the dynamics of our group to minimize the negative aspects and enhance the positives. For example, ideally, the aerodynamicists would be co-located with the CFD engineers, but we’re creating a level of automation for our process that minimizes the need for CFD engineers.
“So the U.S. group will predominantly be doing process advancements like working with turbulence models and working with coding to increase the efficiency of our CFD ops, as opposed to running cases for the aerodynamicists. We’ll no longer have people running cases – the aeros will run their own cases, so we’ve created a huge step in efficiency improvement.”
This all means that the physical separation requires very strict operational procedures, as pointed out by French engineer Rémy Saffar, an ex-Oreca man who previously created the CFD for the LMP1 project of the French manufacturer:
“The things we have to manage are our interactions with the engineers in Italy, where there is a time difference of six hours. It means sometimes the communication can be difficult, and that’s why we had to implement some strict processes and methods in order to avoid any miscommunications between the engineers there and us here. It has been a big challenge, but now it works pretty well and we are able to perfectly communicate through the processes that have been implemented here.”
Even though the team also profits from the (relative) proximity of US universities at the forefront of CFD research, the DNA of the Haas is, clearly, much more European than American.
