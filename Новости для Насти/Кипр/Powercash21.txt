The structure of most businesses is that they need to grow and continue to grow to function at their best. There’s a lot of money in the world, and the only reason a large amount of it can’t be yours is that you might not be able to serve everyone’s needs. But then, one thing is for sure. When it comes to payments, there’s absolutely no excuse for not being able to accept the money of any potential customer that’s anywhere in the world. With so many people out there, you have a nearly endless supply of opportunity.
Receiving payments used to be very simple in that the only options were cash or checks. However, as the world has evolved and the amount of commerce going on has improved, the sheer volume of payments has increased by at least an order of magnitude. This is a natural part of the progression, and this is an essential part of you taking your business to the next level. The trick is this can be difficult if it isn’t handled properly.

The Gateway
The first thing someone is going to see when they want to purchase something is going to be your payment gateway. This is supposed to be a professional and easy-to-use step in the process once the person has already selected what they intend to purchase. This is your first opportunity to make your profit and to show off how well your company works. That’s unless it gets messed up in some way.

People tend to have very little patience for the payment portal that doesn’t function well. Also, if it looks as ugly as sin, it isn’t going to make a good impression on anyone. While the person might be mentally committed to the purchase at that point, they are that much less likely to come back later on to get more of what they want.

Easier and Safer
Data safety is an integral part of the process. No one wants to purchase if there’s a reasonable chance that their data could be breached or taken by an evil force. If the level of safety isn’t where it needs to be, a lot of people are going to be too turned off by your page to actually make a purchase through it. This will hurt your business a lot.

As well, the conventional wisdom that used to hold up no longer does when it concerns ease of use. The likelihood of a purchase is said to decrease by 50 percent for each additional click a person has to make. Therefore, the easier you can make the purchasing process for your potential customers, the more likely they are going to be to make subsequent purchases from you. If it’s too difficult to buy, some people are going to be so turned off that they won’t buy at all. Powercash21 is a great way to ensure that the first purchase is an easy one.

TransferWise
TransferWise is a very useful online payment service for anyone wanting to make a lot of international payments. They are comparatively significantly cheaper than PayPal, especially when sending money to other countries and have a ‘borderless’ account which is great for people like freelancers that want to avoid additional transaction fees.
The system works by giving you one transfer fee and removes any hidden costs. They also have an interesting method of making international payments. This works by taking a payment from a UK bank account for example and deposits it into their own UK bank account, and then if the cash is going to a person in the US the money is transferred from TransferWise’s US bank account at the normal exchange rate. This means that no money actually crosses borders and keeps fees as low as possible.
Pros:
– A very cheap option for international payments
– Open pricing plan with no hidden charges
– Use a borderless account to transfer without getting extra fees in over 40 countries
– Create invoices in any currency
Cons:
– Only bank transfers are accepted
– The borderless account only works for Euros, US Dollars, Australian Dollars and Great British Pounds.
2 Checkout
2 Checkout is great for global payments, and as we’ve mentioned with both PayPal and TransferWise this is a limitation of many payment providers. There is a calculator available which is useful to see if the service works out to be cheaper than PayPal in your country.
Pros:
– no monthly fees or additional charges for setup
– you can use several different types of payment methods including credit and debit cards
– 87 currencies are accepted and the website uses 15 different languages making it the best for international users.
– better fraud security than most other providers
– Recurring billing is accepted
Cons:
– There is a 1 percent fee for any money transfers that aren’t in the US
– There is a $20 charge for any charge backs that you make
– exchange rates are generally higher than the bank’s rate
Payoneer
Payoneer is more like a bank than other options on this list, and you get a full online bank account and credit card when you set up the account. This means that you can use ATMs to get money out and make payments with your card. In addition, making payments online is very easy and only takes one single step.
Pros:
– there are some great options for people that work freelance and want to take money from people for your services.
– The system is simple to set up on your website and takes minimal technical knowledge.
– Use your funds easily with your online bank account and credit card
Cons:
– some reviews of the customer support suggest that it could do with improvement
– Fees for transferring money, whereas this is often free with other providers
– Fees for using ATMs
