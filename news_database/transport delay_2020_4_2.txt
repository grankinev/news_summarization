REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri\n\nThe northern bread basket states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh rely on farm laborers from eastern India, but after the lockdown began on March 24, most of them returned home to their villages.\n\n“We’ve never seen anything like this,” said Ramandeep Singh Mann, a farmer from Punjab, whose family grows wheat, rice and cotton on more than 45 acres (18 hectares) and would employ about 10 workers if they used mechanical harvesters.\n\n“We’ve no-one at all for harvests.”\n\nMann is just one of thousands of farmers concerned he will be unable to get mechanical harvesters to fields or even manage to gather by hand crops likely to be ripe in mid-April.\n\nLate harvests mean lower yields, reduced returns, and a smaller window to plant next season’s crops, as well as leaving crops vulnerable to rain and hailstorms.\n\nIndia has stockpiles of wheat, rice and sugar for its own population and has not been exporting wheat, so international grains markets are unlikely to be affected for now by the labor issues.\n\nBut trade and industry officials say delays in arrival, berthing and other shipping operations could affect rice exports, while the lack of workers could limit exports of fresh vegetables, such as onions.\n\nEven if farmers manage to bring in the harvest, they could struggle to get produce to market because of a lack of drivers for the trucks that can carry large volumes.\n\nMost farmers sell produce at wholesale markets, which depend on large numbers of laborers to unload produce and weigh and pack grain. The staffing shortage could also delay farmers’ payments for produce.\n\n“Who is going to put grains in the bag, bring produce to wholesale markets, and then transport it to various storage facilities?” asked Jadish Lal, a merchant at the Khanna grain market in Punjab.\n\nIn sum, the labor shortage is likely to paralyze activity at the wholesale markets, Sudhir Panwar, head of the farmers’ group Kisan Jagriti Manch said, adding vegetable and horticulture growers are likely to struggle to sell produce, as well as the wheat and rapeseed farmers.\n\nIndia has forecast wheat output at a record 106.21 million tonnes this year, and farmers are likely to produce 7.8 million tonnes of rapeseed.\n\nSome farmers harvested early sown wheat and rapeseed varieties in March, but most growers will collect ripening crops by mid-April.\n\nIndia has so far seen 1,251 infections and 32 deaths from the coronavirus outbreak, which has caused more than 850,000 cases worldwide, with more than 42,000 deaths.\n\nInteractive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser."

            "content": "TC Energy (NYSE:TRP) has approved the construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project. The Canadian energy company expects to invest $8 billion to build the pipeline, which will transport oil from Western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company expects the pipeline to start up by 2023, assuming there aren't any further delays.\n\nGetting the backing it needs\n\nTC Energy has been working toward approving the construction of Keystone XL for several years. It had many hurdles to overcome, including securing the necessary financing for the project. That came from a non-traditional source as TC Energy secured the backing of the Government of Alberta to help fund a portion of the project.\n\nThe Canadian province has agreed to invest $1.1 billion of equity into the project, which should cover all the planned construction costs through the end of this year. TC Energy will kick in $2.7 billion of equity, which will fund building costs in 2021 and 2022. The remaining $4.2 billion will come in the form of a project level credit facility that the Government of Alberta will guarantee.\n\nTC Energy expects to finance its equity commitment via a combination of retained cash flows after paying its dividend, hybrid securities such as preferred stock, and additional common equity by reactivating its dividend reinvestment program in 2021 and 2022. The company could also issue up to 1 billion Canadian dollars ($700 million) of new stock, if needed, to support its balance sheet. Meanwhile, TC Energy plans to acquire Alberta's equity interest and refinance the credit facility in the public debt markets once the project enters service.\n\nWhat the project means for Canada and TC Energy\n\nThe roughly 1,200-mile pipeline will stretch from an oil storage hub in Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska where it will connect with TC Energy's existing pipeline system. It will have the capacity to transport 830,000 barrels per day (BPD) to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. TC Energy has 20-year contracts in place with shippers for 575,000 BPD of that capacity. They desperately need this pipeline to get their oil to refining and export markets because Canada doesn't currently have enough pipeline space to move its oil output out of the oil sands region. That lack of pipeline capacity has weighed heavily on pricing. Crude in the country recently fell below $5 a barrel due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which is less than the cost of shipping it to a refinery. By increasing the country's export pipeline capacity, it should enable producers to capture market prices in the U.S., which recently were much higher at around $20 a barrel.\n\nNot only is the project an important one for oil producers in Canada, but it's also crucial to TC Energy's growth. The long-term contracts the company secured for the project will provide it with $1.3 billion of annual EBITDA, with additional upside potential if demand exceeds its contracted capacity. The secured agreements alone will deliver a meaningful boost to a company that produced CA$9.4 billion ($6.6 billion) in EBITDA last year. As such, it will give TC Energy plenty of additional fuel to keep growing its 5.6%-yielding dividend, something it has done for the past two decades.\n\nDon't expect a smooth ride\n\nAfter lots of hard work, TC Energy is finally confident enough to move forward with construction on the Keystone XL Pipeline, thanks in large part to the financial support from Alberta. However, that doesn't mean the project won't run into additional roadblocks that could delay its 2023 in-service date. Because of that, investors will need to keep an eye on this project.\n\nFuture delays could weigh on TC Energy's stock price and its ability to grow the dividend. However, if the company can deliver the pipeline on time and on budget, then it will provide a significant earnings boost. That could enable it to produce attractive dividend growth and total returns."

Tencent Sports, the main broadcaster responsible for the live production and public broadcast, turned to LiveU to implement a remote production solution, deploying only the necessary equipment on site, including the cameras and wireless transmission units. All the rest, including production, contribution and distribution, was handled by Tencent personnel back in the studio in Tencent's technical center.\n\nTencent Brings Speed Skating Race Live to Viewers in China using LiveU technology. More\n\nThis was challenging work within the strict limitations of the COVID-19 outbreak. The event organizer closed the stadium, didn't allow an audience to minimize the risk of people gathering in one place, and limited the number of essential staff on site. Tencent Sports used four LiveU LU600 HEVC bonding units, which provided solid high-quality live video streams with low delay. All the streaming came to a single high-density LiveU server, with the same delay, optimizing LiveU's Precision Timing™ in its at-home production solution. With support from China Unicom, 5G signal was also available in the field – all the LiveU units combined both 4G and 5G connectivity to ensure optimal streaming conditions.\n\nAccording to Tencent, the live coverage and production workflow was fully enhanced, comparing favorably with previous remote productions. Just like the Simulation Game itself reached real-world Championship levels, Tencent Sports accomplished the same high-quality production standards with its comparatively 'light' infrastructure.\n\nDing Yi, Chief Director of Tencent Sports, said, \"Remote production with fewer facilities and lower costs will undoubtedly become a major trend in sports production in the future. During this difficult virus period, it has showed unique advantage under circumstances which didn't allow us to use the traditional ways of production. Looking ahead, we are keen to cooperate with world-leading technology providers like LiveU to deliver creative sports production solutions.\"\n\nYaal Eshel, General Manager LiveU Asia, said, \"Tencent's coverage of the Simulation Game is truly uplifting, showing how 'the show can go on', even with the challenges of this terrible virus. Live sports bring so much enjoyment to fans and viewers everywhere and we're humbled that LiveU is helping a world-leading broadcaster such as Tencent bring an amazing viewing experience to its audiences.\"\n\nThe Simulation Game enabled the skaters to sustain their performance levels and continue their preparations for the 2022 Winter Olympic. The Game was organized in a way, which strictly followed the rules and regulations of the ISU World Championship.\n\nAbout LiveU\n\nLiveU is driving the live video revolution, providing live video streaming for TV, mobile, online and social media. Let your audience become part of your story with high-quality and flawless live video, transmitted from anywhere in the world, through the use of our patented bonding and video transport technology.

Refunds are being processed as per applicable rules and may include a cancellation fee.\n\nTravel agents, however, say there is uncertainty as to how soon the refunds would be paid. \"We do not know whether it would take one week, one month or even longer to get refunds,\" said Rajat Bagaria, national joint secretary of Travel Agents Federation of India.\n\nLast week, travel agents, airline executives and International Air Transport Association representative held a tele-conference on issues related to agents' remittances and refunds.\n\nFull service airlines give agents seven days to make payment for ticket sales. In a normal scenario agents deduct the refund amount while making their weekly remittance.

One thing that remains unchanged is that we continue to produce massive amounts of waste each day.\n\nSouth Africa generates 59 million tonnes of general waste a year. As only 10,8% of urban households separate their waste, most of the recyclable items get thrown away. Yet the country has recycling rates comparable to European countries for some materials.\n\nThis is thanks in large part to reclaimers who, through what I call their ‘separation outside source’ system, separate people’s recyclables, just outside their homes and at landfills. After salvaging the recyclables, the reclaimers haul them great distances, sort and clean them. They sell the materials to small buyback centres, who sell them to larger buyers. The recyclables are subsequently resold for export or as inputs for production.\n\nSouth Africa’s 60,000 to 90,000 reclaimers collect an astonishing 80% to 90% of used packaging and paper that are recycled, providing crucial inputs for production and saving municipalities up to R750 million a year (US$41.7 million) in potential landfill costs.\n\nDespite their significant contributions, reclaimers in South Africa (as in most countries) are not paid for the service they provide. Instead, they earn a pittance when they sell what they collect.\n\nRead more: How waste pickers in the global South are being sidelined by new policies\n\nSouth Africa’s measures to flatten the COVID-19 infection curve are making reclaimers’ situation even worse. Since the country went on lockdown at midnight on March 26, 2020, reclaimers have been locked out of landfills and cannot work in the streets. They have also been excluded from all forms of government support.\n\nA history of exclusion\n\nThat the measures announced by the government leave reclaimers out should come as no surprise. Current government policies on waste and recycling do not meaningfully include reclaimers. Their central role in the sector is overlooked by an economic model that assumes that a part of the economy can be hived off as “informal” and deemed irrelevant to policy development.\n\nThis has enabled municipalities to completely ignore the separation outside source system and implement recycling programmes that dispossess reclaimers. This is not unique to South Africa.\n\nThe exclusion of reclaimers continues through the government’s responses to COVID-19. Waste management was declared an essential service, allowing workers in this sector to keep working. Not so reclaimers. This, despite their crucial role in municipal solid waste management systems. Like millions of other workers considered informal, they are not eligible for government financial support programmes.\n\nMany governments are disseminating information on how long the virus remains on different materials so that people can protect themselves when they purchase and use them. But, there are no public service announcements on how to dispose of the same products to minimise risks for reclaimers.\n\nIn South Africa, as in countries like Brazil and India, this burden has fallen on reclaimers.\n\nAn essential service\n\nAccording to information gathered by the Global Alliance of Waste Pickers, reclaimers in a number of countries have been affected in similar ways by government responses to COVID-19 that ignore them. Some core demands are emerging. These include permission to continue working; personal protective equipment, soap and washing stations; free rapid testing and health care; a basic income; and food parcels.\n\nIn addition, reclaimers in South Africa are demanding inclusion in the R500 million (US$27.8 million) government fund to cushion small businesses from the ravages of the virus. The South African Waste Pickers Association and the African Reclaimers Organisation want a declaration that they are essential service providers, a simple process to obtain permits, and protective equipment.\n\nThe reclaimers’ demands are in line with the “Guideline on Waste Picker Integration for South Africa”, which recognises and values reclaimers’ role in the sector. Although it must still be published, the guideline was agreed by all stakeholders. The pandemic creates an opportunity for the government to implement the guideline and support reclaimers.\n\nNo time to waste\n\nWhether and how industry and municipalities that rely on reclaimers for profits and savings will assist them is unclear. But the clock is ticking: reclaimers earn their incomes daily and are already struggling. In the absence of government support, not being able to work means they don’t have money to buy food.\n\nIt is crucial that the government designate reclaimers as essential service providers without delay, and give them masks, gloves, protective gear, sanitisers and access to health care. They need access to public spaces and buildings to store their materials, as well as trucks to transport them. Reclaimers need public washing stations, food packages, rapid testing and income support needed by millions of other South Africans.\n\nMany livelihoods are at risk. Resources must be made available to fund reclaimers, along with other essential activities, vulnerable workers and the unemployed.\n\nRead more: All world leaders face mega COVID-19 crises: how Ramaphosa is stacking up"
