Photo : Getty\n\nOver the past few decades, the world has become connected in unprecedented ways. And in 2020, we’re living with those impacts in full force.\n\nThe most in-your-face example is COVID-19, which has spread with alarming speed to 26 countries, killed nearly 1,800, and led to widespread quarantines as health authorities struggle to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization has declared it a global health emergency, and the coronavirus has the potential to become a pandemic. The hyper-connectivity of the world is partly why as a cruise ship and flights with infected passengers have allowed the virus to spread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe virus could also affect the global economy, including even slightly cutting China’s greenhouse gas emissions. While the climate impacts are a tiny footnote in the story of coronavirus, the virus’ spread and the way the climate crisis has grown both make a compelling case for everything that’s wrong with globalization—and where we need to start fixing things if we want humanity to thrive in the 21st century.\n\nCountries now depend on one another for basically everything. And their economies are connected by tourism, manufactured goods, and services. Oil and gas are shipped around the world, fueling the economy and driving our climate into an unsteady state. When disaster strikes in one place, the impacts can ripple around the globe. We can see that today with the coronavirus outbreak and the risk of a global economic slowdown. And we can see it every day with climate change. Burning dirty coal in India impacts glaciers melting in the Antarctic because greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem even if they come from local sources.\n\nThese emissions have also shot up as a result of the globalized economy. International shipping contributed an estimated billion tons of greenhouse gases between 2007 and 2012. Maritime routes are key to the transportation system that allows goods to move from one country to another, worsening the climate crisis. Even the goods themselves are part of the problem. Though China is the largest emitter globally, a large portion of its emissions are due to goods made there and exported globally. In essence, countries like the U.S. and European Union members have outsourced some of their emissions to China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of all this is, well, people. As convenient as globalization may be in driving down the prices of consumer goods for the Global North, it’s hurting many people in the Global South, where poor working conditions and wages allow companies to keep the price of goods like T-shirts or headphones so low. Unfortunately, those same people are left to carry a disproportionate burden from climate change despite having contributed very little to the problem themselves. These same vulnerable populations are most at risk if deadly viruses such as COVID-19 reach their communities because their governments are less equipped to contain such outbreaks.\n\nThanks to globalization, people can’t ignore what’s happening across the world either. We’re connected by the atmosphere, the movement of goods and people, and public health. Benjamin Hale, a philosophy and environmental studies associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Earther that globalization “has made these problems apparent to us in a way that they wouldn’t have otherwise been.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the flip side of that, globalization has connected us all in a way people decades ago might’ve never imagined. And that is also fuel for the environmental movement and finding solutions to the current mess we’re in. As 350.org founder Bill McKibben told Earther, globalization has made it possible for people around the world to connect and build the case for transformative change in ways that were previously unimaginable. This type of movement has the potential to alter the economic system that is threatening our well-being and the planet’s.\n\nThere’s still value in the local, of course. Distributed energy systems like rooftop or community solar, for example, have the potential to loosen the grip of utility monopolies. And for disenfranchised communities, there’s a huge potential for local green manufacturing. That being said, globalization is necessary, especially when it comes to supporting those most hurt by the impacts of climate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Countries like the U.S. have dramatically upset the climate of the planet, and so it’s wrong for them to then bar the door and say, ‘We’re not letting in those people who have to leave their homes because they can no longer grow food where they live,’” McKibben told Earther.\n\nSo while the coronavirus outbreak and the climate crisis show what can happen with globalization gone wrong, there are still ways to leverage global society for ways that are beneficial and even necessary. The climate crisis and COVID-19 are shocks showing the risks we face, but the world shouldn’t need such a scare to change its ways. There are signs like China’s major investments in renewables or recent decisions by major financial firms to curtail their fossil fuel investments that the globalized economy may already be shifting, but it’s nowhere close to done yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Big money is globalized,” McKibben said. “We have to make people power globalized, too.”\n\n"

            "content": "Reuters\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak's effect on the world economy is driving growth near negative levels in the first quarter of 2020, UBS economists wrote on Tuesday.\n\nThe hit to China's economy accounts for most of the bank's updated forecast, with disruptions in Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong also weighing on global expansion.\n\nUBS's guidance doesn't take supply-chain slowdowns into account, and Apple recently warned that a hit to iPhone production would drive quarterly revenue below its initial estimate.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe fallout from the coronavirus outbreak is already showing up in companies' guidance and market reactions. Now UBS economists expect the epidemic to drag global growth near negative levels in the first quarter.\n\nBefore the outbreak, the bank's \"global now-cast\" metric showed growth surging throughout Asia. But its latest reading projected a global growth increase of just 0.5% during the first three months of the year, down from the 3.5% level expected earlier in the quarter.\n\nThe virus' hit to China's economy accounts for most of UBS's lowered guidance, with disruptions in Hong Kong, Thailand, and Singapore also dragging the metric lower. Any growth level below zero reflects a contraction in the global economy, and consecutive quarters of contraction mark a global recession.\n\nUBS's global growth forecast doesn't take supply-chain slowdowns into account, said a team led by Arend Kapteyn. Apple is among the latest firms to update their guidance on the virus' hit to manufacturing. The iPhone maker said on Tuesday that revenue for the quarter ending in March would fall below its initial estimate, citing a temporary hit to global phone supply. Apple shares fell as much as 3.2% on the news.\n\nRead more: A Wall Street firm lists its 5 best hedges for an unusual coronavirus-driven market crash — and shares what to do if it's successfully contained\n\nUBS said it expected central banks to stay in a \"wait-and-see mode,\" holding off on any stimulus as economic data reflecting the outbreak's fallout trickles in. The Federal Reserve is likely to hold its benchmark interest rate steady until inflation rises to its 2% goal. The European Central Bank \"is largely on autopilot\" while it focuses on a strategy review, the team wrote. Even Japan's central bank is expected to stay patient even though the nation saw a virus-related death on February 8, UBS said.\n\nThough the bank's latest guidance reflects an ominous outlook for the world economy, containment of the virus would drive a sharp recovery. Delayed consumption and investment, along with economic stimulus, \"should lead growth to snap back sharply ... similar to what one would see after a natural disaster,\" the team wrote on Tuesday. The net effect on annual growth is a less worrisome 0.2-percentage-point reduction, they added.\n\nThe death toll in the outbreak reached 1,875 people on Tuesday, with more than 73,000 people infected. Most of the infections are in China, though cases have been reported in at least 26 countries. Only five deaths have been reported outside mainland China, with single fatalities in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, and France.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nHSBC tanks the most since 2017 after announcing a $7.2 billion overhaul charge\n\nApple sees $45 billion in market value wiped out after warning that the coronavirus will push revenue below forecasts\n\nSalesforce was just named one of the best companies to work for in 2020.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nThe Diamond Princess, operated by Carnival Corp, has been quarantined after arriving in the port of Yokohama on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus.\n\nMore than 540 people have been infected with the virus on the liner, which originally carried some 3,700 passengers and crew. Many of those infected have already been transferred to hospitals. About half the passengers are Japanese.\n\nJapan ranks second in the world after China in number of confirmed virus due to the ship infections.\n\nJapan has come under fire for its handling of the cruise ship quarantine, although top government officials have defended the quarantine and onboard testing operation.\n\n“Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital,” public broadcaster NHK quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as telling a parliamentary panel.\n\nAround 500 people were expected to disembark on Wednesday, a health ministry official said, with the entire process completed by Friday.\n\n“Day:15: Everyone here, thanks for your support over the last two weeks,” tweeted one departing passenger from Hong Kong with the handle #quarantinedondiamondprincess. “If you ever find yourself quarantined in a windowless room but with access to WIFI, note you can count on people around the world to help.”\n\nNHK said that those who had roomed with passengers who tested positive would have to stay on the ship another 14 days from the time the infected roommate left.\n\nCrew members, who have been sharing rooms, would move to separate rooms and undergo health checks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.\n\nThe United States evacuated more than 300 nationals on Monday on two chartered flights and six South Koreans and one Japanese spouse flew to South Korea on Wednesday morning on a chartered flight.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the quarantine “may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship”.\n\nThe rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, is a risk, it said.\n\nMore than 100 Americans remain onboard or in hospital in Japan, the CDC said. After disembarking from the ship, passengers or crew will be required to wait 14 days without symptoms or a positive coronavirus test before traveling to the United States, the CDC said.\n\nAsked why the Americans faced an additional two-week quarantine but Japanese leaving the ship did not, Suga said it was based on the advice of Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID).\n\nThe NIID said that based on the experience of those who returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, on charter flights earlier this month, there should be no obstacle to using public transport and the like if people had shown no symptoms such as fever for 14 days and had tested negative for the virus during the period their health was under surveillance.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday there were 220 Australians on board and that a total of 169 would be evacuated. Those evacuated will be flown to Darwin, where they will be quarantined for 14 days.\n\nAn Australian passenger said Australians had been told they would be pre-screened starting on Wednesday morning and taken to Tokyo’s Haneda airport in the evening for an expected departure early Thursday.\n\n“They told us to pack warm weather clothes for the two weeks in Darwin but who will have that after a cruise in the Japanese winter,” passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters.\n\nA captain’s announcement on the liner said that Hong Kong passengers would also be evacuated over the next 24 hours and that according to information received, a Canadian charter flight would arrive on Friday morning.\n\nItaly, Israel, Britain and Taiwan were also preparing to evacuate their nationals, said Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.\n\nBesides those on the cruise liner and returnees brought home from Wuhan city, about 60 cases of domestic infections have been confirmed in Japan, including 22 in Tokyo, NHK public broadcaster said.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nAmid worries about a contracting economy, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to curb the size of public gatherings and some companies are telling employees to work from home.\n\nThe spread of the virus has also raised concerns about the outlook for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, set to start on July 24, although organizers have said there are no plans to cancel the Summer Games.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was considering visiting Japan for the Games at the invitation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe."

            "content": "During the past year, in addressing the crisis of climate change, the Democratic Presidential candidates have spoken earnestly, if evasively, about the Green New Deal. But in December, at the last minute, the Democratic leadership in the House agreed to strip a provision from a corner of the tax code—a capitulation that will prove damaging to the environment and to job opportunities. The provision was cut from the omnibus spending bill, a 1.4-trillion-dollar package that was negotiated by the White House, Senate Republicans, and House Democrats and signed by President Donald Trump. The provision, originally conceived in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, was simple: a thirty per cent household tax credit for the cost of installing a residential solar-electricity system. The act, signed by George W. Bush, capped the solar credit at two thousand dollars per project. In 2008, with the Democrats in control of both the House and the Senate and a recession underway, the cap was removed so that thirty per cent of even large-scale residential projects would be rebated at tax time. In 2015, Congress extended that credit through 2019. Now, if new legislation isn’t passed to redeem the credit, it will drop to twenty-six per cent this year, twenty-two per cent in 2021, and nothing in 2022.\n\nLobbyists close to the oil-and-gas industry wanted the tax credit ended; predictably, the Republican leadership and the White House joined them. The majority of House Democrats wanted to extend the credit, but the Trump Administration dug in. The Democratic leadership, it seems, feared a government shutdown before Christmas, which Republicans would blame on them, so they let the credit for residential solar power drop.\n\nBut this was a pivotal fight, and tenacity would have been both simple to explain and likely to gain bipartisan support. This past summer, more than a thousand solar companies signed a letter in support of an extension. Soon after, a group of lawmakers, led by two Democrats—Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, of Nevada, and Representative Mike Thompson, of California—and two Republicans—Representatives Paul Cook, of California, and Brian Fitzpatrick, of Pennsylvania—introduced legislation to extend the credit for five years more, not just for solar electricity but also for fibre-optic solar technology, fuel cells, small-wind technology, microturbines, combined-heat-and-power technology, and geothermal heat pumps. In October, a bipartisan group of two hundred and thirty-one mayors, from Kenosha, Wisconsin, to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, signed a letter in support of the bill.\n\n“Charles Grassley managed a five-year extension for biodiesel” in the spending bill, Gregory Wetstone, the C.E.O. of the American Council on Renewable Energy, which lobbies for solar companies, told me. That credit expired in 2017, so its extension is retroactive to 2018 and runs through 2022. Wetstone was frustrated that Senator Grassley, Republican of Iowa, stood firm for his farming interests (in 2018, Iowa farmers harvested more than five hundred million bushels of soybeans, a key crop for biodiesel production) and prevailed, but Democrats gave in. Most frustrating, he added, is that the credit was not some new idea but one that has been “working well for over a decade.” It has appealed as readily to Rust Belt businesspeople as to Green New Dealers. “The leverage was there to get more done,” Wetstone said. Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, was more blunt. House Democrats, he tweeted in December, “were given a mandate to fight hard” to secure victories on climate action. “They had an opportunity this week. They failed to deliver.”\n\nNor did they convey what was at stake. According to an analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie, a consulting and equity-research company based in the United Kingdom, extending the credit through 2030 would likely have added eighty-two gigawatts of solar power “over baseline forecasts”—that is, forecasts of growth without the credit. Eighty-two gigawatts amounts to about seven per cent of total power-generation capacity in the United States. The credit would thus have offset more than three hundred and fifty million metric tons of carbon dioxide in a decade—equal to a fifth of U.S. electricity emissions in 2018.\n\nThe credit worked and rallied some bipartisan support because it wedded progressive ambitions for government to the market logic of the private sector. House Resolution 109, in which the Green New Deal is envisioned, alludes to the “Federal Government-led mobilizations” that spurred the economy during the Depression and the Second World War; it sees the government now taking a similar role, “dramatically expanding and upgrading renewable power sources” and “prioritizing high-quality job creation.” The expansion of solar energy, specifically, would mean myriad installations in towns and suburbs; dramatic expansion would come, if at all, from the federal government helping to shape market forces there: regulating carbon emissions, normalizing technical standards for regional power grids and electric vehicles, and providing targeted tax incentives.\n\nThe solar tax credit, in this context, has already been “incredibly consequential,” Abigail Ross Hopper, the C.E.O. of the Solar Energy Industries Association, told Wired last summer; it was largely responsible for getting the solar industry off the ground in this country. During the past decade, according to the S.E.I.A., solar installations grew by fifty per cent a year, on average. Since 2011, the Department of Energy reports, installations have grown “more than tenfold,” with more than a million currently in operation. “The cost of solar energy has also dropped as much as 65%.”\n\nSolar installation, moreover, has been a godsend to the struggling construction industry. Nationwide, there are almost seven hundred thousand construction companies of all sizes, employing more than seven million people. Many residential companies have been pushed to the edge since 2008, especially in mill towns and rural areas, where manufacturing jobs have been growing scarce and new home construction has lagged. The tax credit prompted many of those firms to switch to offering residential solar-energy installation. There are now ten thousand solar businesses in the country, located in every state and employing about a quarter of a million people. The tax credit helped them by turning householders who may have been wary of the unfamiliarity—and the cost—of solar power into more or less confident buyers.\n\nMy wife and I were just such householders. Last summer, we installed a solar tracker on our home, in rural New Hampshire; it’s an array consisting of twenty solar panels, mounted on a galvanized steel frame and pylon and connected to a smart piston, which rotates and pivots throughout the day, following the sun. Our tracker was designed to produce, on average, just under ten thousand kilowatt-hours per year. That’s about what our home consumed in 2017 and 2018. The fully installed system cost more than thirty thousand dollars—a serious investment. And one might think that New Hampshire is hardly a place to invest in solar energy, given the long winters of short days. We did, until we looked more closely at the numbers.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the winter months normally see a spike in demand for natural gas for heating, which tends to drive up electricity prices. The average price of a kilowatt-hour is about twenty cents for residential customers, which is among the highest in the nation, owing in part to the cold. So our total annual cost for delivered power (ten thousand times twenty cents) is about two thousand dollars—a hundred and sixty-seven dollars a month. Our tracker, we figured, would compensate us for this sum by replacing much of the electricity that we’d normally have to buy in the winter and by allowing us to sell excess power to the utility company in the summer, albeit at a rate slightly lower than what we’d have paid for it. It would take about sixteen years to pay off the system; with the tax credit, however, it would be paid off in eleven years. After that, the power would be free.\n\nSixteen—or even eleven—years may seem a long time for older homeowners, like us, but the logic of the investment is even clearer if, like us, they borrow to buy the installation. In our case, the question was do we keep paying a hundred and sixty-seven dollars to the utility company, or do we install solar technology and pay monthly installments to the bank? How much would we pay the bank? If we repaid the loan at the standard five per cent, over sixteen years, the monthly payment would be slightly less than two hundred and forty dollars—seventy dollars more per month. The tax credit, however, brings the tracker’s all-in cost down to slightly more than twenty-two thousand dollars—a monthly payment of a hundred and sixty-seven dollars, or exactly the actual cost of power. (There is also an added sum for the mortgage-interest deduction.) The credit meant that we could do something for the planet, the local bank, local business, and our community and pay not a dime more."

Rouhani and his allies won big gains in parliamentary elections, and many hoped a nuclear deal agreed with world powers in 2015 would pull Iran out of political isolation and boost the economy.\n\n“WE HAVEN’T SEEN ANY PROGRESS”\n\nThose aspirations crumbled after President Donald Trump quit the pact in 2018 and reimposed sanctions in an effort to put stricter limits on Iran’s nuclear work, curb its ballistic missile program and end its involvement in regional proxy wars.\n\n“The main root of everything is the economy,” Ali, a mobile phone shop employee in the central city of Isfahan, said by telephone, asking not to reveal his surname.\n\n“If an individual doesn’t have the money to take home bread to his wife and family then he’ll stop praying and even lose his beliefs,” said Ali, who works more hours since his boss kept the store open in traditional afternoon resting periods in the hope customers could wander in. Ali does not plan to vote next week.\n\n“I voted for several years and it didn’t make any difference. We haven’t seen any progress to say we want this or that candidate to come forward,” he said.\n\nThe authorities have been under pressure since last year when protests over a fuel price hike were met with the bloodiest crackdown since the 1979 Islamic revolution, killing hundreds.\n\nA U.S. drone strike that felled top commander Qassem Soleimani in January in Iraq rallied Iranians around a common cause. But the show of support was quickly replaced by angry protests over efforts to cover up the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner that killed all 176 aboard.\n\nThe elite Revolutionary Guards apologized for the calamity, but that did not appease thousands protesting in several cities.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People protest against increased gas price, on a highway in Tehran, Iran November 16, 2019.

Ernawati was one of 140 Indonesian teachers who signed up for a Bebras Indonesia course on computational thinking: a way of learning that stresses critical thinking and problem-solving rather than learning by rote. She’s since passed those lessons on to more than 400 of her students. Now she wants to see the program rolled out across Indonesia—and we’re ready to help make it happen.\n\nAt an event in Jakarta today, we announced a $1 million Google.org grant that that will enable Bebras—a global education nonprofit—to launch Gerakan Pandai: a new program designed to train another 22,000 Indonesian teachers in computational thinking over the next two years.\n\n\n\nWhy is this so important? With 64 million students, Indonesia has the fourth-largest education system in the world. But to give those students the best possible future, we need to make sure they have the skills and knowledge to handle changes in technology and solve the challenges they’re likely to face in the workplace. Bebras’ programs train teachers to help students break problems into smaller parts, assess data, prioritise information, and create solutions to complex issues: skills that are relevant to every career path, not just in the technology industry."

The report tallied expected losses from Chinese visitor spending at $10.3 billion — more than half of which are expected occur this year.\n\nTravel and spending from Chinese visitors in America is massive, with China being the third-largest source of overseas travel to the United States behind the UK and Japan, according to the US Travel Association, an industry-advocacy organization. Each Chinese visitor to the US spent an average of $6,500 in 2018, according to the latest data available, which a spokesperson for US Travel characterized as \"among the highest of all international visitors.\"\n\nIn 2018, Chinese travelers spent a total of $34.6 billion to the US economy, including $17 billion in travel-specific spending. Visitors spent an average of 12 nights in the country, and the majority were in the US for vacation or visits to friends and family.\n\nThis trend appeared to continue in 2019, with data from the National Travel and Tourism Office showing 2.5 million Chinese visitors in the first the first 10 months of the year — accounting for roughly 7% of all overseas visits.\n\nAnalysts looking at the possible industry impact of the coronavirus have referred back to the 2003 SARS outbreak and 2015 MERS episode. However, the scale and spread of the Wuhan coronavirus have both dwarfed SARS, suggesting that the impact could be longer lasting and more severe.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak, the US experienced a 30% decrease in visitors from China, and a 10% fall in travelers from the rest of Asia, according to the Tourism Economics report. It took three years for the market to fully recover.\n\nThe impact is expected to be worse than during SARS because there are more Chinese travelers than in there were in 2003 — according to the Tourism Economics report, visits from China to the US have grown 1,270% since 2002. Then, the Chinese market only represented 1% of all overseas visitors to the US and 3% of visitor spending, compared to 7% of visitors and 16% of spending in 2019.\n\n\"Given the massive increase in the Chinese travel market, the impact in absolute terms will be much larger than from the SARS crisis,\" the report said.\n\nWhile visits impacted by the current coronavirus are expected to ramp back up in 2021, the report projects that it will take about four years to fully recover. An expected 4.6 million hotel room nights will be lost this year — 8.1 million total through 2024 — the report said, with states and cities around the country feeling the impact.\n\nNotably, the projections do not include possible losses from other markets in Asia. If the virus continues to spread outside of China, the impact could be significantly worse.\n\nThe total impact could be enough to affect the nation's gross domestic product: The travel and tourism industries represented 2.8% of the GDP in 2017, according to the Department of Commerce. UBS economists warned that the virus' effect on the world economy is driving growth near negative levels for the first quarter of 2020.\n\nUS airlines have largely tried to contain the damage by preemptively suspending routes to China and reconfiguring capacity to Asia. However, this capacity decrease will still lead to decreased revenue, and the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization forecasted that the global airline industry's revenue could take a $5 billion hit in just the first quarter. Airlines from China and Hong Kong are expected to fare worst.\n\nAccording to a report from Hopper, the travel booking app, demand for travel from the US to China dropped more than 58% compared to 2019 at its lowest point so far this year. The good news for US airlines is that overall travel demand among Americans continues to grow, although there's a shift toward interest in domestic travel over international destinations.\n\nThe economic pain of the coronavirus is expected to reverberate through the entire travel industry, as shown by the Tourism Economics report. The ban on foreign citizens who have been in China within the previous two weeks, combined with plummeting demand for business travel to and from the region, presents an impending disaster for industries that rely on airlines, hotels, museums, conference organizers, and other types of companies in the US that rely on travel from the region.\n\nThe coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, and was first identified and reported in late 2019, has infected more than 73,000 people and killed at least 1,875 around the world. Cases have been found in at least 26 other countries."

How?\n\nSome of the world's largest and most powerful banks spent the past decade mired in scandal, but none descended as far into ignominy as Germany's Deutsche Bank. Its rap sheet includes a staggering array of ethical and legal lapses, including money laundering, tax fraud and sanctions violations — not to mention mysterious ties to President Trump that federal investigators are even now looking into.\n\nHow this plodding, conservative bank from a country famous for diligence and thrift turned into the most infamous casino on Wall Street is the subject of David Enrich's excellent, deeply reported book Dark Towers: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction.\n\nIt is by now a familiar story. \"This proud national icon was seduced by the siren song of Wall Street riches,\" Enrich writes. Thanks partly to deregulation, big firms such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch were coming up with tantalizing new ways to make money, and by 1994 Deutsche Bank wanted a piece of the action.\n\nIt started by recruiting Edson Mitchell, an American executive from Merrill, who believed Deutsche Bank's \"stubborn Germanness was the main impediment to unleashing its full animal spirits.\" Mitchell set about building a global markets operation, not at the bank's Frankfurt headquarters but in London, where he could function more independently. He hired a staff of \"bloodthirsty piranhas\" from Wall Street who knew how to push boundaries, as Enrich's tale tells.\n\nAmong them was Bill Broeksmit, a risk management genius who subsequently killed himself as regulators were moving in on the bank and whose death is the mystery Enrich uses to frame the story.\n\nMitchell died early in a plane crash, but the machinery he built kept chugging along. Enrich tells the story of its rise and fall in the careful style of a good newspaper reporter (he is an editor at The New York Times) but allows the complicated material to unfold like a good novel.\n\nOver time, he writes, Deutsche Bank became less German and more global, so much so that the bank had to post a sign in its London lobby explaining how to say \"Deutsche.\" Too many of the American traders were pronouncing it \"douche bank.\"\n\nWith the piranhas in charge, Deutsche Bank eventually became the biggest bank in the world, with 90,000 employees and some $2 trillion in assets — almost the size of the German economy, Enrich notes. Despite that, it was a clumsily managed place. The bank's antiquated computer system made it difficult for senior management to monitor London's activities, even if they'd wanted to — and it's not clear they did. Management tended to look the other way when employees broke the rules, even when they did business with dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin and their friends. \"Even by the amoral standards of Wall Street, Deutsche exhibited a jarring lack of interest in its clients' reputations,\" Enrich writes.\n\nJust how disconnected the bank became can be seen in its ongoing relationship with a then New York real estate developer named Donald Trump, whose multiple bankruptcies had made him a pariah in the banking world. One part of Deutsche Bank turned down Trump's request for a loan. But the private banking division, which catered to the rich and famous, arranged the loan anyway — and then, when Trump stopped making payments, arranged another one.\n\nTrump's murky relationship with Deutsche Bank is still under congressional investigation, so Enrich's story is necessarily incomplete. Still, the book has enough detail to make its case that Deutsche Bank was more than just one more rogue bank; it is a cautionary tale of what happens when a bank pursues profits at any cost, without being weighed down by pesky moral scruples."

However, this capacity decrease will still lead to decreased revenue, and the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization forecasted that the global airline industry's revenue could take a $5 billion hit in just the first quarter. Airlines from China and Hong Kong are expected to fare worst.\n\nAccording to a report from Hopper, the travel booking app, demand for travel from the US to China dropped more than 58% compared to 2019 at its lowest point so far this year. The good news for US airlines is that overall travel demand among Americans continues to grow, although there's a shift toward interest in domestic travel over international destinations.\n\nThe economic pain of the coronavirus is expected to reverberate through the entire travel industry, as shown by the Tourism Economics report. The ban on foreign citizens who have been in China within the previous two weeks, combined with plummeting demand for business travel to and from the region, presents an impending disaster for industries that rely on airlines, hotels, museums, conference organizers, and other types of companies in the US that rely on travel from the region.\n\nThe coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, and was first identified and reported in late 2019, has infected more than 73,000 people and killed at least 1,875 around the world. Cases have been found in at least 26 other countries.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

(Image source: Reuters) People wearing protective masks walk outside Forbidden City in Beijing, China. (Image source: Reuters)\n\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed over 1,800 lives in China alone with more than 72,000 being infected across the world ever since the deadly communicable disease broke out in China’s Wuhan. The COVID-19 death toll has already surpassed that of the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a global health emergency.\n\nThe deadly virus, which has infected people in over 25 countries, has sent a sense of fear in investors across global markets. With international trade getting disrupted and global outlook looking weak amid growing concerns over containing the outbreak of the COVID-19, the impact of the disease can be felt in the Indian economy and markets as well.\n\nWe look at the various sectors which are likely to take a hit due to the coronavirus disease:\n\nGlobal economy\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 will be significantly felt in China’s economic growth in the near term since the virus originated from there. The Chinese government has tried very hard to contain the disease in Wuhan, the capital of the country’s Hubei province. It has limited the trade and commerce in the city and blocked the movement of the public in the city in a bid to quarantine the infected people, however, this, in turn, has severely affected the trade and commerce in the region, particularly during the country’s annual Lunar New Year celebrations.\n\nChina being the largest economy in Asia and the second-largest economy in the world, the economic impact of coronavirus is likely to trickle down to other countries and their economies as well who deal with the Asian giant. There are many companies which have shut down operations in China due to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nA recent report by the Financial Times, that quoted a Deutsche Bank forecast, said that because of coronavirus, China’s economic growth is going to be 1.5 per cent lower in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, at 4.6 per cent. The global economic growth during the period is expected to be slower by 0.5 percentage points.\n\nMarkets\n\nThe outbreak of coronavirus has triggered a gradual fall in the global stock, commodity and money markets during the past few weeks. Investors are concerned about the damage it will have in the businesses and economy.\n\nMulti-national companies such as PepsiCo, Siemens and Peugeot Citroen have their offices and factories in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province. There are many companies have suspended their work so as to contain the virus, this, in turn, has affected their businesses and stock prices.\n\nFast-food chains such as McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and KFC too have felt the impact of the coronavirus in China. Some of their outlets in the affected region had to be shut down which is likely to have impacted their earnings per store.\n\nAuto components\n\nOne of the key drivers of China’s economic growth over the years has been its automobile and electronic equipment industry. The country is a manufacturing and supplying hub for various automobile companies in the world.\n\nOver the past decades, Wuhan has turned out to be a primary hub for the country’s ever-rising cars parts and accessories export. This sector has had a triple growth during the last decade while engine and motor exports have surged around four times. Due to this ongoing scare of coronavirus, many of such factories have had to be shut down indefinitely. This has affected the supply chain in the automobile sector across the world.\n\nThe lack of auto components has already begun to be felt in the global automobile market. As per the Financial Times report, Fiat Chrysler has already rung alarm bells by saying that it is finding difficulty in sourcing key auto parts from its suppliers in China, and might be forced to halt its production within a few weeks if the virus situation doesn’t improve. Hyundai had to shut its production in South Korea earlier this month, while Volkswagen has postponed restarting production at its factories in China until February 24, according to a report by Deutsche Welle.\n\nPharmaceutical industry\n\nIn India, the prices of paracetamol, which is the most commonly used analgesic, have surged 40 per cent, while the cost of azithromycin, an antibiotic used for treating a variety of bacterial infections, has jumped by 70 per cent, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nIndia is one of the largest suppliers of generic drugs across the world and has about 12 per cent of all manufacturing sites catering to the US market. The pharmaceutical firms rely on China for as much as 80 per cent of its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) requirement.\n\nApple’s business hit\n\nOn Monday, Apple became one of the first mobile phone manufacturers to admit that the coronavirus was affecting its business. The premium smartphone maker said that it was cutting its sales expectations for the ongoing quarter, which it had earlier projected to be robust.\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer, which is heavily dependent on its factories in China and the consumers there, said in a statement that its supply of smartphones would be hampered because production was slower than expected as China reopened its factories.\n\nThe premium smartphone maker also added that demand for its devices in China had been affected because of the outbreak of the deadly virus. Apple had closed all 42 of its stores in China last month and most of them are yet to reopen.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "content": "In recent years, exponential growth in the volume of data and the speed of data integration and management processes has unleashed an explosion of innovation, enabling companies to deliver goods and services that are increasingly responsive, customized and sophisticated in an ever-evolving digital economy.\n\nThis kind of data movement would be impossible without APIs – application programming interfaces. APIs, forms of modern middleware that plug into various data sources and software services to pipe information to the desired destination, are a critical part of the plumbing of the digital economy. Many of the conveniences of our digitally connected, modern lives – like using Amazon’s Alexa to play music over your home speakers from your Spotify account, or asking your car’s navigation system to find a less congested route recommended by Google Maps – would be impossible without the APIs that connect companies with their partners, vendors and customers. Indeed, it would not be much of a stretch to say that under the hood, APIs are the engine powering the digital economy.\n\nKong, the cloud connectivity company with the world’s premier microservices API gateway, is at the head of the pack of a new generation of companies that have emerged in recent years to help organizations optimize their use of APIs. If APIs are the engine behind the digital economy, API gateways are the control panels that determine what goes in and out of this network. Like a smart grid for the cloud, it ensures the flow of data is stable and secure, even at a massive scale. No surprise that API gateways are among the most popular open source technologies, according to new research from Kong/Vanson Bourne.\n\nAdvanced API gateways are capable not only of moving data between organizations (e.g., connecting Alexa to Spotify), but also of managing the constant flow of business-critical information within individual companies in a smart way, delivering automated, faster and reliable connectivity among APIs and humans. Demand for this capability is growing rapidly as organizations replace rigid, legacy IT infrastructure (called “monolithic”) with the more dynamic type of information architecture known as microservices, which leverages APIs to connect discrete software programs and data sources. In this way, microservices API gateways work much like the operating system of a car – coordinating the functions of separate but related systems like the transmission, axle and fuel tank in order to keep the engine running and the car moving in the right direction.\n\nMarco Palladino and Augusto Marietti Avery Wong\n\nLed by co-founders Augusto Marietti and Marco Palladino, Kong’s mission is to make the digital world reliable. The company’s end-to-end platform powers trillions of API transactions for leading organizations around the globe, including AppDynamics, Cargill, Just Eat, Santander, SoulCycle, WeWork and Yahoo! Japan. These companies and many others (Kong’s open source software has been downloaded more than 100 million times) use Kong to accelerate the construction of smart connections between hundreds of software services and data sources, reduce latency and downtime, automate workflows, improve data governance and security, and monitor the traffic running through all of the company’s APIs.\n\n“We’re building the nervous system of the cloud to power all of the enterprises in the world,” explains Marietti. In this analogy, he says, “Kong is the brain and the spine. We want to be the one intelligent broker that can request and respond to data, moving all that information in and out of the company, both within and between teams.” As a microservices API gateway, Kong is not only the brain and spine of an organization, but also its peripheral nervous system – connecting and coordinating the organization’s multitude of internal functions and operations, thus supporting the “limbs and organs” of the business.\n\nEVOLUTION FROM MASHAPE TO KONG\n\nKong’s impressive journey – which has seen it grow and evolve rapidly, turn a profit, and raise $71 million to-date from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, CRV, Index Ventures, and Jeff Bezos – has been ten years in the making. Marietti and Palladino founded the company in 2009 as Mashape, an API marketplace that provided tens of thousands of ready-made APIs for the developer community to build into their own IT infrastructure. In 2015, the co-founders launched Kong as an open source project and in 2017 decided to shift the company’s focus completely to Kong after they saw the huge opportunity and demand for the service – and thus, the company was reborn as Kong.\n\n“We’ve changed our execution over the years, but the vision has stayed the same,” says Marietti. “We knew that there would be a massive explosion in APIs, software and services as companies moved to the cloud, and that every company in the world would need a simple, secure API layer to manage and move all that data. We were ahead of the market when we made the bet that this would be the future of software communications.”\n\nDevdutt Yellukar is a General Partner at CRV and a lead investor from Kong’s earliest days, supporting the company through its most recent $43 million Series C fundraising round in March 2019. Yellukar agrees that Marietti and Palladino’s early recognition of this transformational shift, and their quick steps to capitalize on it, have been critical to the company’s success. “Kong timed it perfectly,” explains Yellukar. “Every company in the world is becoming digital, but to provide digital services, they need APIs that allow their machines to talk to other companies’ machines. And on both ends of those conversations, there’s going to be a product like Kong. You can see that the market opportunity is incredibly large.”\n\nAs any entrepreneur would agree, however, timing is not enough – success hinges on the details of execution. In this respect, Kong has also excelled and differentiated itself in the marketplace through two very important strategic decisions: the choice to open source its platform and to expand into API development.\n\nOPEN SOURCE AS SELLING POINT AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY\n\nAlthough open sourcing software – in other words, making the code for building software publicly accessible for anyone to copy and adapt – was once seen by some as purely academic or even altruistic, today open source is increasingly regarded as a must-have feature by customers, and as a compelling go-to-market strategy by entrepreneurs. Kong was born first and foremost as an open source company, and that crucial early decision has powered its rapid adoption by marquee customers.\n\nFor Kong customer AppDynamics, Kong’s status as an open source provider was a crucial selling point, with this level of transparency increasing their trust in the underlying technology and giving them greater confidence to deeply integrate Kong’s tools throughout the organization. “I frankly wouldn’t even consider buying a closed source API gateway, the tasks are just too critical,” says AppDynamics Senior Director Ty Amell. “API gateways are fairly sticky, so it is important that those types of platforms have an open sourced component.”\n\nOpen sourcing its product is also an important part of Kong’s go-to-market strategy, lending itself to effortless adoption by developers, who then serve as product advocates within their organizations and push for paid enterprise services, creating a flywheel.\n\n“Because it was open sourced, people could just download it and start to appreciate how scalable and secure it was, and how neat and clean the interfaces were,” Yellukar says. “When the team open sourced Kong, there was a giant sucking sound in the market for this. That’s what happens with successful open source companies – there’s humongous love for this type of technology from the community, and that allows you to build the company.”\n\nEVOLUTION FROM API GATEWAY TO END-TO-END API AND SERVICE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION\n\nKong’s latest strategic move that is already gaining promising traction is its recent entry into the lifecycle management of APIs and new role in the development of APIs from the ground up. Kong’s $43 million Series C round helped finance the company’s acquisition of Insomnia, an API testing platform. Insomnia in turn provided the foundation for Kong Studio, a suite of software for developers to design and collaborate on APIs.\n\nAppDynamics’ Amell says that Kong’s entry into the API development space was another key selling point that elevated the service beyond just an API gateway and into a full lifecycle management platform capable of solving multiple pain points for APIs along the path from creation to testing to management. “We had a conversation with Kong early on about where they were going with lifecycle management. If I project out to the future, I think API gateways become part of lifecycle management, so that you can design, test, and manage all from the same platform.”\n\nThis strategy is also compelling for Kong because providing developers with the tools and raw materials for building APIs will add greater value to customers. “We realized that by offering a way to design, build, and test services, we can further streamline processes for our customers and enable them to be more productive,” says Marietti. “Once enterprises have done that, then they can use Kong’s API gateway to manage these services. We’re building a full lifecycle platform that helps you end-to-end, like the circle of life – you’re born, you build, design, test, and manage. Eventually you retire some functions you don’t need anymore, and then you start all over again.”\n\nRIDING THE TAILWINDS\n\nWhile Kong is already transforming the industry, Marietti says the company is just scratching the surface and that the pace of innovation will only continue to accelerate from here on out. Investments in artificial intelligence will be a key driver of this continued innovation as we are now seeing with Kong Brain, the company’s first major step to automate API management and transform what is effectively a system of “dumb pipes” into a true nervous system. The company continues to drive open source innovation as well, launching its latest open source project, Kuma, this past September.\n\nUnderneath it all, the fundamental shift of enterprises moving into the cloud and putting more and more data in motion, both within and between organizations, is driving Kong’s success. Backed by these promising tailwinds, it’s hard to put an upper bound on Kong’s future prospects for growth.\n\n“Companies are going to be migrating to the cloud and facing the challenge of how to move more and more data for the next 100 years,” says Marietti. “There’s a long way to go, and I think companies are only 1% of the way there. There’s a real need, and that’s how Kong is growing so quickly – the market is pulling it.”"

Reno allows divorcees to establish residency in six weeks, and instantly processes the divorce papers no matter the reason for the split. Time magazine shares the history of how Reno built its reputation over the years:\n\nThe practice of seeking divorce in Reno dates back to the early 20th century, when the city shrewdly built lodging and entertainment steps from its courthouse, drawing a steady flow of “divorce tourists” looking to escape the East Coast press. By the 1950s, by which time Reno’s divorce laws had further loosened, a thriving economy had evolved for the sole purpose of meeting divorcees’ needs while they waited — and, indeed, Reno relied on the divorce trade to keep her coffers full.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat the majority of Reno divorce-seekers were women reflects the fact that men had jobs that kept them home, though many women found work in Reno, either by choice or necessity. A steady need for waitresses, laundresses, card dealers, clerks, maids and even ranch hands meant a girl could arrive with next to nothing and earn enough to pay her way. For many women, this was the first time they had money of her own to manage and spend.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage via wikimedia commons"

Today's move upward is a long-awaited positive for many investors, who have seen all three fall by double digits so far in 2020. Even after today's gains, Eldorado Gold and Hecla Mining shares are still down 9% and 4% year to date.\n\nSo what\n\nToday's jump was largely a speculative move upward on investor interest in gold. Gold prices have steadily edged higher since late in 2019, in part because of increasing concerns over the global implications of COVID-19, the strain of coronavirus that's already killed more than 1,300 people and bringing parts of China's economy to a standstill. The International Energy Agency recently revised its forecast for global oil demand for the first quarter of the year and now expects the impact of coronavirus on that country's economic output to lead to the first quarterly drop in oil demand in over a decade.\n\nWhat does that have to do with gold? Directly, not much -- though ironically it could actually reduce industrial demand from manufacturers. But if there's one thing investors hate, it's uncertainty. However, economic uncertainty is often a boon for gold prices, and that's great for gold miners like these. Here's what gold prices have done over the past few months:\n\nGold prices are now at the highest levels in about six and a half years, and above $1,600 per ounce for the first time since 2013.\n\nNow what\n\nCOVID-19 coronavirus is likely to remain a source of uncertainty for months to come, with victims both human and economic. However, it's almost certain to prove a speed bump, little more than a historical footnote, and not a global pandemic that brings the world economy to a screeching halt. (Can you name anyone who made a fortune during the SARS outbreak? Me, neither.)\n\nAnd just as quickly as investor interest -- or speculation, more accurately -- has helped drive gold prices higher, the next shiny object will come along and could send gold prices falling. The catch here is that even a modest drop in gold prices would probably result in a dramatic drop in the stock prices of these three precious-metals miners, as investors look to move quickly to get out the door.\n\nAdd it all up, and here's what every investor considering gold needs to know: There may be some quick money to be made in gold miner speculation if gold prices do continue climbing. But there will also be plenty of losses on the other side when the rally comes to an end. Far too many investors will end up there.\n\nBefore you make a bet on any gold stock, learn how to invest in gold stocks so you can avoid big mistakes."

Supreme Court injunction on Wet’suwet’en traditional territory, enabling crews from Coastal GasLink to get to a key work site.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSome of those protests have snarled commuter traffic, while others, including two in Metro Vancouver, have blockaded rail lines — sometimes with an overt intent to disrupt the economy.\n\n“This isn’t a symbolic action, it’s not protests,” said Isabel Krupp with activist group the Red Braid Alliance (formerly Alliance Against Displacement) last week at a blockade in Coquitlam that disrupted West Coast Express service.\n\n“It’s direct defence of the land through disrupting the flow of capital, through disrupting the flow of commodities, to put direct pressure on Canada to back off Wet’suwet’en.”\n\nDemonstrators, who call themselves land defenders, say they are acting in support of the rights of Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs, who are fighting the Coastal GasLink pipeline through their territory. The hereditary chiefs, who claim exclusive authority over unceded traditional territory, say the project does not have their consent.\n\n1:47 Anti-pipeline protests stop West Coast Express Anti-pipeline protests stop West Coast Express\n\nPresident and CEO of the Business Council of British Columbia Greg D’Avignon said it’s too soon to say how much of an economic effect that disruption is having, but that there’s no question it’s happening.\n\n“It’s having an immediate impact on the ability of supply chains to move goods within Canada, but also as the gateway through Vancouver and the biggest port in Canada, they’re moving goods in and out of our nation,” he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nD’Avignon said imports being disrupted range from vehicles to medicine to cell phones, while Canadian exporters are also feeling the pinch.\n\nBut he said his biggest concern is the impact the blockades have on Canada’s reputation as a reliable trading partner.\n\n“The world is watching and it’s undermining our reputation as a certain place for trade in a certain place for investment,” he said.\n\n“Ultimately, that has a long term impact on the prosperity and the very reconciliation that we’re looking to achieve in British Columbia and Canada.”\n\n2:43 Police arrest protesters at two Lower Mainland ports Police arrest protesters at two Lower Mainland ports\n\nGreg Wilson, director of government relations with Retail Council of Canada, said the backlog would affect small communities more seriously than Metro Vancouver, and posed a risk to shipments of food and medication that are prone to spoilage.\n\n“Any time you have shortages or outages on the shelf it costs a retailer money,” he said.\n\n“For small retailers that can mean the only shipment they have coming in for a month or a quarter are stuck in a delay.”\n\nOn Monday, B.C. Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation Scott Fraser and federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations Carolyn Bennett met in Victoria to strategize finding a peaceful solution to the blockades.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe pair released a joint statement saying they had reached out to the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs with the aim of setting up a meeting.\n\n1:45 Demonstrators opposed to Coastal GasLink pipeline project target Vancouver rail lines Demonstrators opposed to Coastal GasLink pipeline project target Vancouver rail lines\n\n“There is no doubt that the blockades and other events of the past several weeks have been, and continue to be, a significant challenge,” said the ministers in a joint statement.\n\n“We acknowledge that this is a difficult time for Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and are determined to work with all our partners to find the solutions.”\n\nThe last rail blockade to hit the Lower Mainland cropped up at Renfrew Street and the Grandview Highway on Saturday, with no major protests turning up Sunday or Monday.\n\nThe Port of Vancouver said it expects its backlog to persist “in the short term.”\n\n-With files from Robyn Crawford"

China said Tuesday the number of infections from a new virus surpassed 20,000 as medical workers and patients arrived at a new hospital and President Xi Jinping said \"we have launched a people's war of prevention of the epidemic.\" (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe coronavirus is rattling China’s political and economic system at the worst possible time.\n\nAlthough still growing at slightly over 6% (this quarter’s numbers notwithstanding), the country’s economy is expanding at its slowest rate since 1990. And this trend started long before anyone heard the word coronavirus.\n\nNow, with factories across the country slow to re-open, or operate anywhere close to maximum capacity, all eyes in China and around the world are focusing on Chinese President Xi Jinping and his brethren in Beijing.\n\nThis is a major problem for a country with one political party and little individual freedom. One whose legitimacy is solely based on the ability to “outperform the global market”.\n\nPopulations around the world have proven willing to sacrifice certain democratic rights for better livelihoods. However, as we have seen recently throughout Latin America and the Middle East, when the government fails to uphold its side of this social contract, citizens demand transparency and accountability.\n\nWithout a formal mechanism for redress, chaos can ensue.\n\nIn need of a savior, crypto and blockchain may provide the catalyst and relief valve that China needs.\n\nIt Had All Been Going So Well\n\nAlthough many scholars have long felt that democracy, personal liberty, free markets, and capitalism go hand-in-hand, since its founding in 1949 the People’s Republic of China has proven otherwise.\n\nIn fact, looking at how political discourse in the U.S. is devolving into what one might expect from toddlers (even if they are eloquent), bureaucrats and citizens in China believe, perhaps rightfully, that their model of state capitalism is the future.\n\nIt has been hard to argue with the numbers. China is now the second-largest economy in the world, accounting for 16% of global GDP. Even if official statistics are taken with a grain of salt, China’s “real” GDP has growth rate has been between 6-8% in the last decade. In comparison, over the same time period, the U.S. GDP never topped 3%. Furthermore, China’s overall GDP is almost 9x larger than it was during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.\n\n106370939-1580805432325chinagrowth.png World Bank, OECD, and CNBC\n\nBut Like All Good Things\n\nThis breakneck economic growth was never going to last, and in recent years Chinese leadership has tried to downgrade consumer expectations without sabotaging their reputation as the only group of politicians and technocrats able to steer China’s economy.\n\nDemocracies have inherent fail-safes when citizen expectations are not met. Elections may not always lead to prudent outcomes, but they at least give people a voice and offer the ability debate ideas in an open format. If nothing else, they are a very public check on elected bureaucrats.\n\nIn countries such as China, where the political and technocratic classes are not filled by meritocratic and democratic means, citizens become suspicious of official government statements and wonder if they are getting the real story. They also start to care much more about government excess and rising inequality between the working classes and the wealthy and elites.\n\nIncome inequality is not limited to market-based societies. In fact, from 1985-2010 China’s Gini coefficient (which measures inequality – a score of 0 reflects total equality/1 means complete inequality), grew 67% from 0.30-0.50. This measurement is actually higher than that of the U.S. over the same period.\n\nDoubling-Down on the Economy\n\nGiven that China is not opening its political system anytime soon, their strategy is to reach into the historical playbook and recreate the famed Silk Road with its “Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)”. Launched in 2013, the BRI aims to link China with Central, South, and Southeast Asia, as well as the Middle East and Europe through an overland Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road. As of January 2020, more than sixty countries—accounting for two-thirds of the world’s population—have signed on to projects or indicated an interest in doing so.\n\nThe thinking behind this strategy is two-fold – both in service to Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. First, many of the countries captured under BRI are indebted, impoverished, and struggling under the current macroeconomic climate. This gives China the opportunity to lock these countries into its orbit on very advantageous terms.\n\nAn incidental benefit, but not immaterial is that China can use BRI to restore its global reputation, one in which many people are fearful of its rise.\n\nAlthough hard numbers are difficult to come by, China is expected to invest hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars in loans and financing in the coming years. Morgan Stanley estimates that total expenditures will reach $1.2-1.3 trillion by 2027.\n\nChina's Belt And Road Initiative (BRI). A 3D rendering of a stylized globe encircled by a belt and a ... [+] road with three silk ribbons behind. Getty\n\nRaising the Stakes – and the Risks\n\nThere is a chance that BRI rejuvenates the global economy and ushers in a new era of Pax Sinica, but could also worsen and expand the predicament facing Chinese leadership. Pouring billions or trillions of dollars into countries that struggle to follow the rule of law and have compromised justice systems can exacerbate corruption. In time, this could come back home to China and a citizenry that sees BRI as just another avenue to enrich the privileged at the expense of the people.\n\nEnter Crypto and Blockchain\n\nCrypto and blockchain technology can help ensure that this does not happen. The technology can help with everything from reducing black market transactions that facilitate criminal behavior and reduce unpaid taxes, to adding transparency and immutability to reported economic and financial figures. It can add additional transparency to loan negotiations and supply chain and trade finance operations.\n\nBut above all, it can provide documented to proof to all who ask that the BRI is being operated fairly and efficiently.\n\nChina Needs Blockchain With Its BRI – and the World Needs China to Recover\n\nSome people in the Western Hemisphere are hoping that China’s precarious economic situation will lead to the downfall of the CCP and usher in a new era of democracy in East Asia’s biggest country. History teaches us that these transitions to do not happen often, and definitely not easily (see Venezuela, Libya, Iran, Syria, and North Korea). Other times a country ends up trading one authoritative regime for another (see Egypt).\n\nFurther complicating the picture, China is integrated into global supply chains, on both the import and export sides, on such a scale that there is zero chance that a China under chaos will not leave collateral damage. If the damage to manufacturing across automobiles, electronics, and a host of other industries from the coronavirus is any indication, a truly destabilized China would be devastating to the global economy.\n\nBlockchain might be its closest port in the storm, let’s hope they take it."

(Source: @T20WorldCup/Twitter)\n\nThe seventh edition of Women’s T20 World Cup 2020 will begin on Friday (February 21) at Sydney’s Showground Stadium as defending champions Australia take on India. Australia have dominated the shortest format of the game lifting the trophy on four occasions while England and West Indies have both lifted the trophy once. For India, the best result so far has been making it to the semi-finals, on three occasions.\n\nThis time as the 10 teams participate in the mega event, here’s a look at the some of the most interesting numbers from the tournament over the years:\n\nMost runs:\n\nNew Zealand batswoman Suzie Bates is the leading run-scorer in the tournament’s history. Bates has scored 881 runs from 28 matches at an average of 33.88 including six half-centuries.\n\nFor India, Mithali Raj has scored 726 runs from 24 games. However, Raj has retired from the T20 format. In the current team, Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur has scored 428 runs from 25 games at an average of 23.77 including one century and one half-century.\n\nHighest individual score:\n\nMeg Lanning has an impressive strike rate of 115.42 in Women T20 World Cup events (Source: Reuters) Meg Lanning has an impressive strike rate of 115.42 in Women T20 World Cup events (Source: Reuters)\n\nOnly three women have crossed the three-figure mark in the Women’s T20 World Cup. Australia’s Meg Lanning played a 126-run knock against Ireland in 2014 edition. West Indies’ Deandra Dottin scored an unbeaten 112 against South Africa in 2010. India’s captain Kaur is the third to score a century in the tournament.\n\nThe 30-year-old scored 103 runs against New Zealand in the previous edition.\n\nMost fifties:\n\nEngland’s former wicketkeeper-batswoman Sarah Taylor and White Ferns’ Suzie Bates have scored six half-centuries each in the tournament over the years.\n\nMost sixes and fours:\n\nWest Indies’ Dottin has hit 22 sixes. Her six percentage is 20.68 and is followed by India’s big hitter Kaur, who has hit 16 sixes with a six percentage of 22.43. When it comes to boundaries, Suzie Bates has hit 102 fours followed by Lanning with 91 fours.\n\nHey Deandra, what do you always think about?#T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/T6DVDgMuJs — T20 World Cup (@T20WorldCup) February 17, 2020\n\nMost runs in a single edition:\n\nAustralia’s Lanning scored 257 runs from six games in 2014 edition.

West Indies all-rounder Dottin tops the charts here as well with five wickets for just five runs against Bangladesh in the previous edition. Her best bowling figures included one maiden over as well.\n\nSouth Africa’s Sune Luus, India’s Priyanka Roy and Australia’s Julie Hunter are other three bowlers with five-wicket hauls in the mega event.\n\nALSO READ | Poonam Yadav’s three wickets help India edge out West Indies in World Cup warm-up\n\nMost wickets in a single edition:\n\nEngland’s Anya Shrubsole took 13 wickets in six games in the 2014 edition. Shrubsole bowled three maiden overs in the 24 overs she bowled. Her average was 7.53 and economy rate was a stellar 4.08.\n\nFor India, Diana David is the highest wicket-taker in a single tournament with six wickets from nine games in the inaugural edition.\n\nMost dismissals (wicketkeeping):\n\nNew Zealand’s Rachel Priest has the most number of dismissals (20) behind the stumps including 14 catches and six stumpings. England’s Sarah Taylor has 20 dismissals too but it includes 12 catches and eight stumpings.\n\nIndia’s Sulakshana Naik is in sixth place with 16 dismissals (five catches and 11 stumpings). The number of stumpings recorded by Naik are only second to Taylor.\n\nHighest innings score:\n\nThe 200-run mark is yet to be crossed in Women T20 World Cup events. India holds the record of the highest innings total. India scored 194/5 against New Zealand in the previous edition. Skipper Harmanpreet scored a century while youngster Jemimah Rodrigues scored his maiden World Cup half-century.\n\nALSO READ | If we win the World Cup, there’s no doubt things will change: Harmanpreet Kaur\n\nLowest innings score:\n\nThe lowest innings score by a team in the Women T20 World Cup belongs to Bangladesh.

            "content": "Atomico, the European venture capital firm founded by Skype’s Niklas Zennström, has announced that it has closed its fifth fund — “Atomico V” — giving it another $820 million to invest in European startups.\n\nThe London-headquartered VC firm’s previous fund closed at $765 million, so this is an increase over three years ago. However, the remit remains largely the same. Atomico says it plans to double down on its strategy of backing “mission-driven” European founders at Series A, but with the ability to invest in what it calls “breakout” companies at the Series B and C stage.\n\nThe new fund brings Atomico’s total assets under management to a hefty $2.7 billion. Investors are said to include various institutional investors, such as pension funds, fund-of-funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments, banks, family offices and government-backed entities from across the world.\n\nA number of individual LPs have backed Atomico V, too, including what are described as founders and early team members from some of Europe’s most successful startups over the last 10 years, including Adyen, Klarna, TransferWise, Spotify, Supercell, Skype and Zoopla.\n\nFounders delivering “positive, transformational change”\n\nAtomico’s Zennström has long argued that entrepreneurs, not politicians, are the new “changemakers” because of the way technology is reshaping society and the economy. Inherent in this world view is that technology and entrepreneurship can and should be a force for good and that venture capital (and Atomico, specifically) has a “critical part to play in a world with so many urgent challenges” — from sustainability, fixing education, to better healthcare. However, unlike a pure Silicon Valley perspective, Zennström doesn’t believe that “for good” is inevitable and will require formal checks and balances to be put in place (see the firm’s “Conscious Scaling” programme).\n\nTo that end, Atomico says that fund V will allow it to continue to partner with “ambitious European founders, who deliver positive, transformational change across every aspect of society and the economy,” with the aim of building category-winning and sector-defining companies. “We’re guided by a simple belief: profit and purpose are mutually reinforcing, not mutually exclusive,” says Zennström in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Atomico has already made several investments out of fund V. They include urban farming company Infarm; medical AI company HealX; AI-assisted design and construction simulation company Spacemaker; machine learning-based medical imaging company Kheiron Medical, employee retention company Peakon; digital procurement platform Scoutbee, childcare platform Koru Kids; sales team automation software Automation Hero; and doctor messaging service AccuRx.\n\nPersonnel changes\n\nThe formal closing of Atomico’s fifth fund marks a new era for the VC, which has seen a freshening up of its 60-person investor and operational team over the last three years.\n\nJust last month, Irina Haivas, Atomico’s surgeon-turned-VC, was promoted to partner. In March 2019, three new (non-investment) partners were added to the list: Bryce Keane (comms), Alison Smith (chief of staff) and Camilla Richards (investor relations). The previous year saw Sophia Bendz, the former Spotify global director of Marketing, promoted to partner. And in September 2017, Tom Wehmeier, the firm’s head of Research, also made partner.\n\nThere have been departures, too. Most recently, long-time partner Mattias Ljungman left to raise his own seed fund. Before that, Carolina Brochado jumped ship to join SoftBank’s Vision Fund in London, and Teddie Wardi left for America to join Insight."

            "content": "Read: How climate change could trigger the next global financial crisis\n\nBut the deeper challenge has to do with scale and imagination. There are only so many nonprofits and experts working on climate change. If a successful group has an annual budget of $10 million, then giving it $50 million will not necessarily make it five times as effective. Many helpful projects are probably too small for Bezos. “Across the entire landscape, there are not enough people and projects that can take the kind of capital we need,” Firger said.\n\nBezos has pledged a titanic amount of money. If he spends it evenly across 10 years, he would immediately be the country’s biggest climate philanthropist. The Hewlett Foundation, which holds that title today, spends $120 million per year on climate projects. At roughly $1 billion a year, Bezos would more than octuple that amount. It is a testament to Bezos’s wealth that he could single-handedly devote $400 million a year to new-energy R&D, exceeding what the federal government spends on ARPA-E, the Department of Energy’s advanced-research incubator—and still have $600 million a year left over for everything else.\n\nAt the same time, $10 billion is not nearly enough to save the world. Consider the Gateway Tunnel, one of America’s largest pending public-works projects. When completed, the 11-mile tunnel will double the number of trains that can pass between New York and New Jersey at rush hour. If the United States hopes to flush carbon pollution out of its economy, it will have to complete many projects at the Gateway Tunnel’s size and scale. But the tunnel is projected to cost about $9.5 billion, or roughly $860 million per mile. Bezos’s magnanimous gift of $10 billion can buy one Gateway Tunnel.\n\nOf course, this is a slightly facetious comparison—it’s not like Bezos was planning to invest in tristate-area infrastructure. But any similar build-out would present challenges. Jenny Chase, a solar-energy analyst for BloombergNEF, told me in an email that $10 billion would not do much good supporting large-scale solar projects: There is already a surfeit of capital chasing them.\n\nRead: Investment bankers are now waging the war on coal\n\nWhere could $10 billion go the furthest? It just may be politics. In 2016, the network of conservative groups run by the industrialists Charles and David Koch promised to spend about $900 million on the presidential election. Two years later, it pledged about $400 million to the 2018 congressional midterms. Both of those amounts, widely covered as unprecedented interventions in the political system, represented not only the personal donations of the Kochs but the pooled contributions of hundreds of like-minded donors.\n\nBut with his $10 billion, Bezos could single-handedly spend comparable amounts on every presidential and midterm election from now to 2050—supporting climate-friendly members of Congress, governors, and presidents. Once in office, those politicians could then shake loose far more than $10 billion for tunnels, new rail projects, and everything else."

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson shook up his government on Thursday, firing and appointing ministers to key Cabinet posts. Johnson was aiming to tighten his grip on government after winning a big parliamentary majority in December's election. That victory allowed Johnson to take Britain out of the European Union in January. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)\n\nLONDON (AP) — Britain announced new post-Brexit immigration rules Tuesday that will make it tougher for European Union citizens, but easier for people from many other nations, to move to the U.K. starting next year.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government said the new rules would “open up the U.K. to the brightest and the best from around the world” while ending “the reliance on cheap, low-skilled labor coming into the country.” But U.K. employers said the radical changes could bring about a labor crisis for sectors such as health and social care.\n\nBritain’s exit from the EU last month after 47 years of membership is triggering the biggest change to the country’s immigration rules for decades.\n\nDuring Britain’s EU membership — and until a post-Brexit transition period runs out on Dec. 31 — citizens of any of the EU's 27 nations can freely live and work in the U.K.\n\nMore than 3 million EU citizens currently living in the U.K. are entitled to stay. But from January 1, 2021, new immigration rules will apply to EU and non-EU citizens alike.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said Britain's new “points-based immigration system” would assess prospective immigrants on a range of skills, qualifications, salaries or professions.\n\nPeople hoping to work in Britain will need a job offer paying at least 25,600 pounds ($33,000) a year. That’s less than the current 30,000 pounds ($39,000) set for non-EU immigrants, a figure that is more than the country's average annual wage. Prospective immigrants who earn lessmay be able to come if they have other skills.\n\nSkilled immigrants are currently required to have a university degree but in future will only need the equivalent of Britain's pre-university “A levels.”\n\nThe government says the new rules will cut net immigration from its current level of more than 200,000 people a year. But it has abandoned a pledge made by previous Conservative governments to cut Britain's annual net immigration figure to below 100,000 a year.\n\nThe immigration plan still has to be passed by Parliament — which is highly likely since the Conservatives have a large majority.\n\nThe government said it would come up with specific proposals for scientists, graduates, health care workers and those in the agricultural sector. But there is no specific immigration route for what the government calls “low-skilled workers” — a category it says includes 70% of the more than 1 million EU citizens who have moved to the U.K. since 2004.\n\nHundreds of thousands of EU citizens currently hold jobs in sectors including farming, health care and restaurants that are relatively low-paid.\n\nEmployers in those industries have warned there will be worker shortages under the tighter immigration rules. The U.K. Homecare Association described the lack of provisions for low-paid immigrant workers in the proposals as \"irresponsible.”\n\n\"Cutting off the supply of prospective care workers under a new migration system will pave the way for more people waiting unnecessarily in hospital or going without care,” it said.\n\nBut the government was unsympathetic.\n\n“We need to shift the focus of our economy away from a reliance on cheap labor from Europe and instead concentrate on investment in technology and automation,” it said in a policy paper. “Employers will need to adjust.”\n\nMany people who voted in 2016 for Britain to leave the EU were believed that immigration had driven down wages and driven up joblessness among British-born workers. The evidence for this is partial at best.\n\nThe Migration Advisory Committee, an independent body consulted by the government on immigration plans, said introducing a points-based system would only “very slightly increase GDP per capita, productivity, and improve the public finances” compared to continued free movement of EU citizens, and would also reduce Britain's economic growth.\n\nDiane Abbott, the immigration spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, called the proposed new system flawed.\n\n\"This isn't an 'Australian points-based system', which is a meaningless government soundbite,” she said. “It's a salary threshold system, which will need to have so many exemptions — for (the health service) — for social care and many parts of the private sector, that it will be meaningless.”\n\n___\n\nFollow AP’s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit."

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nConcern over the impact of high levels of immigration from the European Union was one of the key drivers behind Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the bloc and the government has said it plans to bring overall migration numbers down.\n\nThe new system will assign points for specific skills, qualifications, salaries or professions and only give visas to those who have enough points. It will come into force from Jan. 1, 2021 and will treat EU and non-EU citizens the same.\n\n“We have got a number of routes through the points-based immigration scheme that will enable people to come here with the right kind of skills that can support our country and our economy,” interior minister Priti Patel said.\n\nBut business groups said that many firms relied on overseas labour and cautioned there might not be enough domestic workers to tend crops, care for patients and serve food - a deficit that could undermine the world’s fifth largest economy.\n\nEU citizens will not need a visa to enter Britain as a visitor for up to six months.\n\nThe Home Office said it would follow a recommendation made last month by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), an independent body which advises the government, to lower the minimum general salary threshold for skilled migrants to 25,600 pounds ($33,330) a year, from 30,000 pounds.\n\nSkilled workers will need to meet criteria including specific skills and the ability to speak English, the government said, and those applying will need to have a job offer.\n\nThere will be no specific entry route for low-skilled workers, something the government hopes will help reduce the number of migrants.\n\n“We need to shift the focus of our economy away from reliance on cheap labour from Europe and instead concentrate on investment in technology and automation. Employers will need to adjust,” the government said in a policy document setting out its plans.\n\nThe MAC estimated the impact of the government’s planned salary and skills thresholds would mean around 70% of European Economic Area citizens who have arrived in Britain since 2004 would not have been eligible for a visa.\n\nStudents will be covered by the points-based system, the government said, while there will be separate initiatives for scientists, graduates, National Health Service workers and those in the agricultural sector."

All these factors would lead to margin pressures for exporters in FY21,” India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said.\n\nHowever, it expects key raw material prices to remain low in 2020-21, after a correction in 2019-20, contributing to a modest recovery in margins, stable working capital requirements and steady cash flows.

            "content": "These days, markets forgive and forget anything except the suspension of share buybacks.\n\nGlobal banking behemoth HSBC’s net profit slumped 53% in 2019, to $5.97 billion, after the lender announced a $7.3 billion write-off to reflect weakened conditions in global banking and markets, and European commercial banking. Its shares dropped 6% in London and are now down 25% from a peak in January 2018.\n\nMany of the bank’s problems originated in Europe, where the ECB’s negative-interest-rate policy is decimating even large Eurozone banks’ ability to turn a profit. HSBC’s write-down in the 4th quarter resulted in a pre-tax loss of $4.65 billion in the bank’s European business. In the U.S., where lower interest rates also took a toll on the group’s performance, revenue shrank 3%, to $4.7 billion, and adjusted profits before taxes fell 39% to $600 million.\n\nIn a bid to reverse this trend, HSBC will embark on an ambitious global restructuring program that will see it withdraw even further from certain markets. The number of countries it operates in has already dwindled from 87 in 2011 to just over 50 today, spurring HSBC to eventually ditch its slogan, “the world’s local bank.” The number will keep falling as it doubles down on its Asian pivot.\n\nThe bank also plans to slash around 15% of its global workforce over the next two years, which would amount to 35,000 job cuts, bringing its workforce down to about 200,000 people, in the hope of reducing operating costs by just over $4 billion. “This represents one of the deepest restructuring and simplification programs in our history,” said interim CEO Noel Quinn.\n\nQuinn said some of the job cuts would occur through natural attrition as existing employees leave HSBC of their own volition. But its under-performing investment bank is likely to suffer a large number of the cuts. So, too, are the bank’s European operations, where it aims to reduce costs by 25%. It’s not yet clear how many jobs could be on the line in its domestic UK market where the bank employs some 40,000 people. Workers in the U.S. also face significant job losses amid HSBC’s planned closure of around a third of its 224 branches there.\n\nThe bank also plans to shed $100 billion of assets by 2022, with the stated goal of keeping pace with its sharper, nimbler, more focused competitors.\n\nHSBC will also suspend share buybacks for the next two years to pay for the restructuring costs. In this climate, markets forgive and forget anything except the suspension of share buybacks. The announcement of cutting 35,000 jobs would have normally boosted shares, as even massive write-offs are ignored. But the suspension of share buybacks is toxic.\n\nWhile HSBC blames the bulk of its poor performance on mature markets in Europe and North America, with their low or negative interest rates, it’s in its most important market of all, Hong Kong and mainland China, where it faces the biggest headwinds and risks. HSBC’s headquarters may be based in London but it’s in Hong Kong where the lion’s share of its money is made.\n\nBy far Asia’s biggest financial hub, servicing not just China but many other Asian markets, Hong Kong accounted for 60% of HSBC’s global pretax income in 2019. Throw in mainland China and it reaches 75%. As Bloomberg notes, “few if any of the world’s largest financial companies dominate a single market quite like HSBC does in Hong Kong”. The bank is the city’s biggest mortgage lender in the secondary market, rules the roost in investment banking, and is one of Hong Kong’s three note-issuing banks.\n\nBut Hong Kong’s local economy, already mired in a deep contraction during the second half last year due to the combined result of months of political upheaval and a protracted trade war between the U.S. and China, is now reeling from the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nIn 2019, despite all the political turmoil, HSBC managed to increase its pre-tax profits in Hong Kong by 5%. But now, COVID-19 has been thrown into the mix.\n\n“Since the start of January, the coronavirus outbreak has created significant disruption for our staff, suppliers and customers, particularly in mainland China and Hong Kong,” Quinn said. “Depending on how the situation develops, there is the potential for any associated economic slowdown to impact our expected credit losses in Hong Kong and mainland China. Longer term, it is also possible that we may see revenue reductions from lower lending and transaction volumes, and further credit losses stemming from disruption to customer supply chains.”\n\nHSBC’s leading role in global trade finance means it’s acutely vulnerable to the widespread disruption that’s already beginning to dislocate global supply chains as a result of China’s official reaction to the coronavirus.\n\n“As of yet there’s no huge immediate impact,” says Andrew Rigden Green, a partner at law firm Stephenson Harwood. “But what will happen if this goes on for a long period of time, or the banks in China continue to be closed, or the correspondent banks are unable to issue export letters of credit in relation to certain sales? Then there could be failures in the trade finance chain.”\n\nHSBC has already moved into action to try to mitigate this risk, offering to provide $3.9 billion in liquidity relief for businesses in Hong Kong, including cash flow support for trade finance customers. Together with a number of other large Hong Kong-based lenders, it has also announced plans to allow mortgage holders and struggling small businesses to make interest-only payments on loans, in the hope that this will keep the customers in its most important market solvent.

            "content": "Countries with confirmed cases of the coronavirus/COVID-19 as of February 17, 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nIn my previous article I noted the potential issues the coronavirus, now officially named COVID-19, would have on Mobile World Congress (MWC) and other issues. Less than a week later, MWC has been cancelled and information on COVID-19 is becoming clearer. Unfortunately, the situation could have significant ramifications for not just the tech industry, but also the global economy.\n\nThroughout last week, companies rapidly canceled their participation in MWC over concerns of the virus to the extent that it was canceled for the first time in its 30-year history. At the same time, it appeared that new cases and deaths from the virus were leveling off. That quickly changed when the Chinese changed the way officials “classify” cases and the numbers rapidly spiked. The change in numbers was not completely unexpected as many had concerns that the numbers were being under reported. The Diamond Princess cruise ship harbored in Japan has provided an isolated example of how contagious the virus is as it continues to spread. So far, 542 passengers and crew out of a total of 3,700 have tested positive for the virus and the numbers have increased daily. The same is expected in China and other locations as experts appear unclear about the ways in which the virus can spread. In addition to the questions over the spread of the virus, there are also questions as to how long the virus will last. Some experts believe that warmer temperatures may have an impact on the virus as with SARS and MERS, but others have said that containment may be an issue beyond 2020.\n\nIn addition to the virus, there are economic concerns over the virus outbreak. The virus is already impacting global travel and tourism, trade shows, sporting events, and the shipment of goods. As I noted in the previous article, in the tech and other manufacturing industries, there will be concerns of shortages throughout the supply chain from raw materials to finished goods, even when shipping resumes. Getting to that point may be much more challenging than previously thought. I’ve had the opportunity to talk to contacts in or close to China, and the situation and impact could be much worse.\n\nIn terms of the numbers for the outbreak, they could still be severely under reported. Both masks and virus test kits are in extremely short supply in China. As a result, many people showing some or no signs of illness are not being tested. And those that have already died are not being tested. As a result, the numbers could be several factors higher than even the revised official numbers. However, the Chinese are taking drastic steps to prevent the spread of the virus and prevent over taxing already strained medical resources. While the national government is involved, in some cases, local governments are left to determine the course of action. In some cities/regions, residents are being confined to their homes or wherever they are presently located. In other locations, only one person is being allowed to leave a domicile once a day or once every other day to get food. Additionally, some of the ill are being quarantined in their residence rather than in the hospitals and are being brought food and care. Additionally, the restrictions on travel mean those that were away on holiday may not be able to return to their homes. And, even if they can return to their home, they may not be able to return to work if it is in a different city or region.\n\nThe Chinese government is concerned about the economic impact of the virus outbreak and is encouraging companies to restart under certain conditions. The government is encouraging those that work in offices to work at home. If they do not have the resources to do so, the company must provide a plan to adhere to some safety standards, such as disinfectant showers and desks at least a meter apart or separated by an approved partition. Manufacturing is a greater challenge. Some companies shut down completely for the holidays and need the manpower to return in order to restart. Others were operating on skeleton crews working long hours. In the later case, crews are reaching exhaustion and there is the potential for running out of resources once inventories are depleted and/or not being able to ship products. With the largest concentration of electronics products assembled in China, this creates huge problems for the entire tech industry. Everything from semiconductors to printed circuit boards (PCBs) to complete systems for consumer electronics, cars, and industrial applications could be negatively impacted.\n\nThe same is true for other segments leveraging Chinese natural resources and manufacturing. But it doesn’t end there. There is concern that the outbreak may spread to other developing nations that have even fewer resources. Regions such as India, North Korea, and several Middle Eastern countries that share borders with China. In addition to the potential death toll, the global economy could be thrown into a recession.\n\nCancellations continue to rise at upcoming technology conferences Tirias Research\n\nFor the tech industry, Tirias Research believes that there will be spot resource and device shortages impacting the tech industry throughout the first half of 2020. In addition, this threatens many industry events, especially large global ones like MWC. According to recent announcements, Embedded World (EW) will proceed in Nuremberg, Germany next week, the same time that MWC was scheduled to be held. The presumption is that EW will have a smaller Asian contingent than MWC and thus has lower risk of spreading the virus. I don’t agree with that rational and apparently so do others. Several companies have withdrawn from EW including Arm, Bridgetek, Digi-Key, FTDI, NXP, Rohm, SolidRun, and STMicroelectronics. Companies are also questioning attendance at other industry events. IBM has cancelled its participation in the RSA conference, which is also scheduled for next week but located in San Francisco. While we believe this will impact normal business functions for the entire tech industry, such as sales and marketing, product development, and manufacturing, we do not believe there will be a prolonged impact on the shipment of goods due to disinfectant procedures being put in place.\n\nOf greater concern to the tech industry is what the outbreak could do to consumer spending. This will undoubtedly reduce consumer sentiment in China, which will lower sales of electronic products. However, any spread or prolonging of the virus outbreak beyond the next eight weeks could have an impact on the entire global economy. As is, the virus could shave off one to two percentage points from global GDP growth for 2020, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast to be 3.3%. If there is a resolution by summer, the economy could bounce back in late Q3 and throughout Q4. But, if the outbreak spreads or is prolonged, the global economy could be forced into a recession.\n\nDespite the potential doom and gloom in the worst case scenarios, the tech industry is still bound for growth in 2020 if the outbreak subsides due to renewed growth in PCs that began in 2019, the rollout of 5G devices and networks, and the innovation around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Let’s hope for the best, but plan for the worst."

            "content": "Over the years, brands have evolved from logos and marketing messages into societal forces with the ... [+] ability to impact the world. Barkley\n\nOver the years, brands have evolved from logos and marketing messages into societal forces with the ability to impact the world, especially when they are built like an operating system around a powerful core idea that leverages the connective nature of today’s consumer. Why think about a brand like an operating system? Because people are watching everything an organization does, and those that behave with integrity and purpose, inside and out, become brands built for tomorrow. In his new book Scratch: How to build a potent modern brand from the inside out, author Tim Galles redefines brands, and says the future belongs to those that apply creativity to every facet of the brand for the win.\n\nI spoke with Galles on his prediction for how brands will evolve to meet the growing demands of today’s modern consumers as well as how whole brands consider the role of sustainability and purpose.\n\nJeff Fromm: How has the definition of brand changed compared to what it meant in the past, and what’s driving such an evolution?\n\nTim Galles: In the earliest days of mass marketing and advertising, name recognition and word-of-mouth alone drove sales and consumer loyalty, fueled mostly by the TV and marketing industrial complex. In the past few decades, brands have become more than advertising and logos, as experience became a competitive advantage. Today, while these elements are still vital, we are in the midst of an era that requires a new, holistic definition of brand—it’s essentially a memory created by the sum of every experience a person has with a company or organization. It’s an amalgam of expectations and experiences, of promises made to employees, consumers and the world. And it’s what comes to life in people’s minds, how they imagine and interpret the actions and ideas of an organization in the moments that matter most. Every brand is different for every person. For example, Nike to you is likely different than Nike to me.\n\nHow did we get here? Empowered consumers fueled by easy access to knowledge about brands is a big part of it. This has also created a stage for interesting brands to actually be a true part of culture and a part of people’s stories. People have so many ways to figure out what's actually happening behind the scenes of the brands they choose to engage with (or not). The potent brands are those that realize every action they take could be a reason someone chooses them, so everything is the brand, not just marketing.\n\nFromm: How does this new definition of brand impact how companies and organizations reach consumers?\n\nGalles: It breaks down the wall between a brand’s story, its products, services, purpose and culture, and how it communicates that story in a way that connects with people. In the past these were very separate activities, like Church and State. Companies that do this well are what I call whole brands: Vans. Patagonia. Glossier.\n\nWhole brands stand for something—they have a powerful idea at the core of everything they do that inspires every action they take, both inside their walls and out in the world. This is a game-changer in the modern market, where, research shows, consumers aren’t as interested in a brand’s story until it helps them tell their own.\n\nFromm: As you think about brands and the role they play, we live in an era where the word “government” and “collaboration” are rarely in the same sentence. What is your take on the role of brands and making the planet better in public policy?\n\nGalles: As you know through all of your work on purpose, a growing number of brands are realizing they have the power to impact people and the planet by the choices they make, inside and out. Some are motivated because it’s the right thing to do. Others are motivated by the demand coming from their consumers who believe they have the obligation to provide better products, treat employees better, and protect the earth.\n\nDone well, in an authentic way, a commitment to purpose can become a reason people choose a brand. Even Patagonia’s founder, Yvon Chouinard, says their provocative actions are really just a different kind of marketing. But it is marketing. He’s very clear about that. Today’s consumers consider such actions not only regarding what to purchase, but also what kind of companies they want to work for. A brand’s belief system around purpose and sustainability can be a win-win for both consumers and employees alike. Ultimately, that is a whole brand at its best.\n\nFromm: Thank goodness for discerning consumers.\n\nGalles: They really drive everything. They have the tools, channels and the forums to make demands of brands in unprecedented ways. The open market has always been a much better laboratory than the government. Some brands feel threatened by such high expectations, but most are just slow and see the definition of brand as a fragmented effort, sitting in the corner of the organization with limited powers. I see huge opportunity for brands that embrace this holistic definition of brand, especially in terms of what I call black box solutions: brands coming in as disruptors from outside of the category, solving problems in creative ways the competition historically couldn’t or didn’t. These brands are proving that walking in with a bigger purpose, with sustainability, with an inspired workforce and brand culture and using them as unfair advantages to innovate new ways of business, can move a market. It’s really creativity without borders, and the brands that adopt this behavior are the ones I’m betting on."

The checkpoint, his gestures and the line of U-turning vehicles indicate, is closed.\n\nBehind him towers the glass and concrete skyline of Shenzhen—the nearest Chinese city to Hong Kong. Without the usual throng of travelers, buses and hawkers here at Lo Wu station, the only noise comes from water buffalo grunting across the tracks.\n\nThis and nine other border crossings were recently shut in a bid to contain the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus, COVID-19, that emerged in the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan, wreaking havoc on the mainland and spreading far beyond.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the symbolically charged boundary with the mainland has become yet another font of militant unrest after months of anti-government protest. Residents in this semi-autonomous enclave—which the British handed back to China in 1997—insist the whole thing must be sealed. A suspected bombing campaign appeared to be an attempt to pressure the government into doing just that. Nobody was injured, but the spate of homemade explosives, planted at a hospital, a public toilet and Lo Wu station, took “one big step closer to terrorism,” police said earlier this month.\n\n\n\nBeyond the looming health scare, this latest fight to control the people, pathogens and ideas that cross the border reflects the same deep distrust of the Chinese Communist Party that exploded during the recent protests. It also exposes a dirty secret that many protesters and their supporters try to downplay: how easily antipathy toward the party translates into resentment of ordinary mainland Chinese.\n\nBeijing’s increasing assertiveness in recent years has fueled outrage against perceived encroachment. It has also helped catalyze a distinct Hong Kong identity—one rooted in defending the territory’s unique freedoms against an influx of mainland money, people and power. “Hong Kong is not China” has become a rallying cry throughout the city, sprayed onto walls and chanted at protests. Anger extends to anything identified with China: emblems, businesses and even people.\n\nLong distrusted as agents of demographic, socioeconomic and even political occupation, mainlanders are now feared as vectors of disease, emboldening a bigotry that increasingly spills into violence.\n\n“As long as the epidemic keeps worsening, people will at the back of their minds blame the mainlanders and think, ‘After all, it’s the mainlanders who started all this,’” says Willy Lam, an expert in Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nThis photo taken in Hong Kong on Feb. 6, 2020, shows the border fence with Shenzhen, China (background), near Lo Wu station. | ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP via Getty Images More\n\nRead more: The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping’s Dreams of a Chinese Century\n\nA nightmare relived\n\nIn Asia’s financial center, where more than 60 cases have been recorded compared to the mainland’s 75,000, anxiety is compounded by memories of another nightmare. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) traumatized the city in 2003, claiming 299 lives. Then, Hong Kong was in the middle of the outbreak. Now, the epicenter lies about 600 miles away.\n\nYet the cosmopolitan hub of 7.5 million resembles a city in lockdown. Restaurants, shopping malls and public transportation are largely deserted as people work from home and schools are closed. Medical masks are in such short supply that lines hundreds long form beside pharmacies rumored to have stock. Runs on toilet paper, bleach and rice have denuded grocery store shelves."

            "content": "Getty Images Russia and China would each like to undercut American hard and soft power abroad by destabilizing the U.S. from within.\n\nNEW YORK (Project Syndicate) — In my 2010 book, “Crisis Economics,” I defined financial crises not as the “black swan” events that Nassim Nicholas Taleb described in his eponymous bestseller, but as “white swans.”\n\nAccording to Taleb, black swans are events that emerge unpredictably, like a tornado, from a fat-tailed statistical distribution. But I argued that financial crises, at least, are more like hurricanes: they are the predictable result of built-up economic and financial vulnerabilities and policy mistakes.\n\nThere are times when we should expect the system to reach a tipping point — the “Minsky Moment” — when a boom and a bubble turn into a crash and a bust. Such events are not about the “unknown unknowns,” but rather the “known unknowns.”\n\nFinancial markets remain blissfully in denial of the many predictable global crises that could come to a head this year, particularly in the months before the US presidential election. In addition to the increasingly obvious risks associated with climate change, at least four countries want to destabilize the US from within.\n\nBeyond the usual economic and policy risks that most financial analysts worry about, a number of potentially seismic white swans are visible on the horizon this year. Any of them could trigger severe economic, financial, political, and geopolitical disturbances unlike anything since the 2008 crisis.\n\nFour powers\n\nFor starters, the United States is locked in an escalating strategic rivalry with at least four implicitly aligned revisionist powers: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. These countries all have an interest in challenging the U.S.-led global order, and 2020 could be a critical year for them, owing to the U.S. presidential election and the potential change in U.S. global policies that could follow.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the U.S. is trying to contain or even trigger regime change in these four countries through economic sanctions and other means. Similarly, the four revisionists want to undercut American hard and soft power abroad by destabilizing the U.S. from within through asymmetric warfare.\n\nIf the U.S. election descends into partisan rancor, chaos, disputed vote tallies, and accusations of “rigged” elections, so much the better for America’s rivals. A breakdown of the U.S. political system would weaken American power abroad.\n\nMoreover, some countries have a particular interest in removing Trump.\n\nThe acute threat that he poses to the Iranian regime gives it every reason to escalate the conflict with the U.S. in the coming months — even if it means risking a full-scale war — on the chance that the ensuing spike in oil prices CL.1, +1.34% would crash the U.S. stock market SPX, -0.29% , trigger a recession, and sink Trump’s re-election prospects.\n\nYes, the consensus view is that the targeted killing of Qassem Soleimani has deterred Iran, but that argument misunderstands the regime’s perverse incentives. War between U.S. and Iran is likely this year; the current calm is the one before the proverbial storm.\n\nCold war with China\n\nAs for U.S.-China relations, the recent “phase one” deal is a temporary band-aid. The bilateral cold war over technology, data, investment, currency, and finance is already escalating sharply.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has reinforced the position of those in the U.S. arguing for containment, and lent further momentum to the broader trend of Sino-American “decoupling.”\n\nMore immediately, the epidemic is likely to be more severe than currently expected, and the disruption to the Chinese economy will have spillover effects on global supply chains — including pharma inputs, of which China is a critical supplier — and business confidence, all of which will likely be more severe than financial markets’ current complacency suggests.\n\nCaroline Baum: Stock market abandons all caution even as killer coronavirus spreads\n\nAlthough the Sino-American cold war is by definition a low-intensity conflict, a sharp escalation is likely this year. To some Chinese leaders, it cannot be a coincidence that their country is simultaneously experiencing a massive swine flu outbreak, a severe bird flu, a coronavirus epidemic, political unrest in Hong Kong, the re-election of Taiwan’s pro-independence president, and stepped-up U.S. naval operations in the East and South China Seas.\n\nRegardless of whether China has only itself to blame for some of these crises, the view in Beijing is veering toward the conspiratorial.\n\nCyberwarfare\n\nBut open aggression is not really an option at this point, given the asymmetry of conventional power. China’s immediate response to U.S. containment efforts will likely take the form of cyberwarfare.\n\nThere are several obvious targets. Chinese hackers (and their Russian, North Korean, and Iranian counterparts) could interfere in the U.S. election by flooding Americans with misinformation and deep fakes. With the electorate already so polarized, it is not difficult to imagine armed partisans taking to the streets to challenge the results, leading to serious violence and chaos.\n\nRevisionist powers could also attack the U.S. and Western financial systems — including the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) platform. Already, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that a cyberattack on European financial markets could cost $645 billion.\n\nAnd security officials have expressed similar concerns about the U.S., where an even wider range of telecommunication infrastructure is potentially vulnerable.\n\nBy next year, the U.S.-China conflict could have escalated from a cold war to a near-hot one.\n\nA Chinese regime and economy severely damaged by the COVID-19 crisis and facing restless masses will need an external scapegoat, and will likely set its sights on Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and U.S. naval positions in the East and South China Seas; confrontation could creep into escalating military accidents.\n\nDump Treasuries?\n\nIt could also pursue the financial “nuclear option” of dumping its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.60% if escalation does take place. Because U.S. assets comprise such a large share of China’s (and, to a lesser extent, Russia’s) foreign reserves, the Chinese are increasingly worried that such assets could be frozen through U.S. sanctions (like those already used against Iran and North Korea).\n\nOf course, dumping U.S. Treasuries would impede China’s economic growth if dollar BUXX, +0.02% assets were sold and converted back into yuan USDCNH, -0.1299% (which would appreciate). But China could diversify its reserves by converting them into another liquid asset that is less vulnerable to U.S. primary or secondary sanctions, namely gold GC00, +0.56% Indeed, both China and Russia have been stockpiling gold reserves (overtly and covertly), which explains the 30% spike in gold prices since early 2019.\n\nIn a sell-off scenario, the capital gains on gold would compensate for any loss incurred from dumping U.S. Treasuries, whose yields would spike as their market price and value fell. So far, China and Russia’s shift into gold has occurred slowly, leaving Treasury yields unaffected. But if this diversification strategy accelerates, as is likely, it could trigger a shock in the U.S. Treasuries market, possibly leading to a sharp economic slowdown in the U.S.\n\nU.S. won’t sit idle\n\nThe U.S., of course, will not sit idly by while coming under asymmetric attack.\n\nIt has already been increasing the pressure on these countries with sanctions and other forms of trade and financial warfare, not to mention its own world-beating cyberwarfare capabilities. U.S. cyberattacks against the four rivals will continue to intensify this year, raising the risk of the first-ever cyber world war and massive economic, financial, and political disorder.\n\nLooking beyond the risk of severe geopolitical escalations in 2020, there are additional medium-term risks associated with climate change, which could trigger costly environmental disasters. Climate change is not just a lumbering giant that will cause economic and financial havoc decades from now. It is a threat in the here and now, as demonstrated by the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nIn addition to climate change, there is evidence that separate, deeper seismic events are underway, leading to rapid global movements in magnetic polarity and accelerating ocean currents.\n\nAny one of these developments could augur an environmental white swan event, as could climatic “tipping points” such as the collapse of major ice sheets in Antarctica or Greenland in the next few years. We already know that underwater volcanic activity is increasing; what if that trend translates into rapid marine acidification and the depletion of global fish stocks upon which billions of people rely?\n\nWhere we stand\n\nAs of early 2020, this is where we stand: the U.S. and Iran have already had a military confrontation that will likely soon escalate; China is in the grip of a viral outbreak that could become a global pandemic; cyberwarfare is ongoing; major holders of US Treasuries are pursuing diversification strategies; the Democratic presidential primary is exposing rifts in the opposition to Trump and already casting doubt on vote-counting processes; rivalries between the U.S. and four revisionist powers are escalating; and the real-world costs of climate change and other environmental trends are mounting.\n\nThis list is hardly exhaustive, but it points to what one can reasonably expect for 2020. Financial markets, meanwhile, remain blissfully in denial of the risks, convinced that a calm if not happy year awaits major economies and global markets."

China has committed to boosting its purchases of goods and services from the United States by $200 billion over two years.\n\nOther products subject to exemption on additional tariffs imposed during the escalation of the bilateral trade dispute include denatured ethanol and some wheat, corn and sorghum. Some medical devices and metals including copper ore and concentrates, copper scrap and aluminium scrap are also subject to exemption, China's finance ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe exemptions come amid a coronavirus epidemic that has seriously disrupted the world's second-largest economy. Authorities throughout the country imposed major restriction on travel and transportation to curb the spread of the virus, which has killed nearly 1,900 and infected more than 70,000 in the country.\n\nSome US officials and analysts have raised questions about China's ability to meet the purchasing commitments specified in the Phase 1 trade deal due to the coronavirus.\n\nThe virus outbreak, which was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in December, has kept factories shut or operating with drastically reduced staffing. The public has also been discouraged from leaving their homes or going to public places, also stunting consumption.\n\nFirms seeking exemptions on the additional tariffs on US products can submit applications from March 2, the finance ministry said. Any exemption granted will be valid for one year."

The checkpoint, his gestures and the line of U-turning vehicles indicate, is closed.\n\nBehind him towers the glass and concrete skyline of Shenzhen—the nearest Chinese city to Hong Kong. Without the usual throng of travelers, buses and hawkers here at Lo Wu station, the only noise comes from water buffalo grunting across the tracks.\n\nThis and nine other border crossings were recently shut in a bid to contain the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus, COVID-19, that emerged in the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan, wreaking havoc on the mainland and spreading far beyond.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the symbolically charged boundary with the mainland has become yet another font of militant unrest after months of anti-government protest. Residents in this semi-autonomous enclave—which the British handed back to China in 1997—insist the whole thing must be sealed. A suspected bombing campaign appeared to be an attempt to pressure the government into doing just that. Nobody was injured, but the spate of homemade explosives, planted at a hospital, a public toilet and Lo Wu station, took “one big step closer to terrorism,” police said earlier this month.\n\n\n\nBeyond the looming health scare, this latest fight to control the people, pathogens and ideas that cross the border reflects the same deep distrust of the Chinese Communist Party that exploded during the recent protests. It also exposes a dirty secret that many protesters and their supporters try to downplay: how easily antipathy toward the party translates into resentment of ordinary mainland Chinese.\n\nBeijing’s increasing assertiveness in recent years has fueled outrage against perceived encroachment. It has also helped catalyze a distinct Hong Kong identity—one rooted in defending the territory’s unique freedoms against an influx of mainland money, people and power. “Hong Kong is not China” has become a rallying cry throughout the city, sprayed onto walls and chanted at protests. Anger extends to anything identified with China: emblems, businesses and even people.\n\nLong distrusted as agents of demographic, socioeconomic and even political occupation, mainlanders are now feared as vectors of disease, emboldening a bigotry that increasingly spills into violence.\n\n“As long as the epidemic keeps worsening, people will at the back of their minds blame the mainlanders and think, ‘After all, it’s the mainlanders who started all this,’” says Willy Lam, an expert in Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nThis photo taken in Hong Kong on Feb. 6, 2020, shows the border fence with Shenzhen, China (background), near Lo Wu station.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) traumatized the city in 2003, claiming 299 lives. Then, Hong Kong was in the middle of the outbreak. Now, the epicenter lies about 600 miles away.\n\nYet the cosmopolitan hub of 7.5 million resembles a city in lockdown. Restaurants, shopping malls and public transportation are largely deserted as people work from home and schools are closed. Medical masks are in such short supply that lines hundreds long form beside pharmacies rumored to have stock. Runs on toilet paper, bleach and rice have denuded grocery store shelves.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Panic is “spreading faster than the virus because the government is not acting in an efficient manner,” says Dr. Ho Pak Leung, a microbiologist and director of the Centre for Infection at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nUnion members, democracy activists and even pro-establishment politicians have joined together in calling for the border’s closure. Striking medical workers have threatened to quit en masse. Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, rejected sealing the border as impractical and discriminatory but eventually agreed to shut all but three checkpoints and impose a mandatory, 14-day quarantine for anyone entering from the mainland. The measures are unprecedented but not enough to the many who fear that contagion will overtake Hong Kong and mainland patients will sap its medical reserves.\n\n“We have to protect our own people first,” says Ng, a patient care assistant who joined the recent strike. “If our medical system goes down, then there will be no one to help Hongkongers.”\n\nWith the border still partially open, some have taken it upon themselves to enforce their own restrictions. Several restaurants refuse to serve speakers of Mandarin (the official language of the mainland, unlike Hong Kong where Cantonese dominates). Some hotels require certificates of health from mainland guests, and a student from Hubei told local media that mainlanders quarantined at a university were doxxed.\n\nRead more: The Pandemic of Xenophobia and Scapegoating\n\nYet experts have warned that the draconian travel bans adopted by much of the world may only divert vital resources from public health tasks and inflame Sinophobia.\n\n“I don’t see any public health reason to justify sealing of borders at this point in the outbreak,” says Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nMedical workers wearing protective masks gather during a protest outside the Hospital Authority's head office in Hong Kong, China, on Feb. 4, 2020. Paul Yeung/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nA fraught boundary\n\nBeyond the public health debate, the push to seal the border brims with political subtext.\n\nWith its riverbanks, barbed wire fences, passport checks and a compact no-man’s land, the 25-mile perimeter sets Hong Kong apart from the rest of China, designating it as a place where the laws of the mainland do not apply.\n\nA colonial relic, the boundary follows the same line as it did under the British. Their efforts in the 1970s and 1980s to reinforce the border and maintain a stable population—after the influx of refugees in previous decades—transformed the territory. Once a temporary sanctuary for those fleeing famine and political instability, it became a settled homebase with a specific local identity, anthropologist Ip Iam-chong writes in “Politics of Belonging: a study of the campaign against mainland visitors in Hong Kong.”\n\nAfter Hong Kong retroceded to China in 1997, the border served as a “firewall” protecting the city’s autonomy, says Jeffrey Twu, who researches border conflicts and nationalist movements at Columbia University.\n\n“This call to shut down the border is not so much about asking the government to literally close all the immigration booths. It’s really this urgent call for the government to rethink its relation vis-à-vis the central government in Beijing,” he says.\n\nBut the increasing permeability of the border in recent years has exacerbated the fears of local activists that Hong Kong, with the British gone, will become just another Chinese city. After Beijing loosened restrictions on travel in 2003, mainland visitors provided an economic lifeline for Hong Kong’s SARS-bruised economy, filling hotel rooms, restaurants, malls and boutiques. But as visitor numbers swelled from 7 million in 2002 to 51 million in 2018—nearly seven times the city’s population—resentment grew.\n\nIncreasingly, the economy catered to the needs of deep-pocketed Chinese day-trippers, who were accused of everything from congesting the streets to allowing their children to defecate in public. “Many of them are very rude,” Isaac Au, a 30-year-old Hongkonger, says of mainlanders in what are fairly common sentiments. “When they are rich they think that they can just spend money and they are the kings of the world.”\n\nBirth tourism, competition for college spots and the growing use of Mandarin has also irritated locals. Conspicuous consumption by mainland shoppers—some estimates say the city accounts for up to 10% of the $285 billion annual global sales of luxury goods—has exacerbated the sense that many Hongkongers are being priced out of their own city. So has the influx of mainland money into the local property market, already one of the world’s most expensive.\n\nBeijing has attempted to boost territorial integration through massive infrastructure projects. A high-speed railway that directly connected Hong Kong to 58 mainland cities, and brought the Chinese capital Beijing within nine hours’ reach, opened in 2018. So did a $18.8 billion bridge linking Hong Kong to the former Portuguese colony of Macau and the mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai.\n\nAttempts were made to foster cultural assimilation too—like a 2012 campaign to introduce “patriotic education” in Hong Kong schools. But that initiative fueled bitter protests and China’s growing has proximity left Hongkongers cold. According to an annual survey by the Hong Kong University Public Opinion Program, Hongkongers’ sense of being Chinese hit an all-time low in 2019. Among 18 to 29 year olds, 75 percent identified as “Hong Kong” rather than Chinese, while 49 percent of those 30 or older felt the same.\n\nGraffiti reading \"Hong Kong Is Not China\" is displayed on the wall of a highway during a protest in the Central district of Hong Kong, China, on July 21, 2019. Kyle Lam/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nEscalating violence\n\nThis simmering angst has regularly burst into xenophobia. In 2012, a local newspaper ad infamously depicted mainland Chinese as locusts draining the city of its resources and “locusts” has since stuck as a derogatory name for mainlanders. Nativist groups sprang up, pledging to defend their home. One, Hong Kong Indigenous, staged “reclaim” campaigns in 2015, targeting mainland shoppers.\n\nThe initially fringe cause found far wider support during the recent pro-democracy protests, which morphed into a broad, ideological battle to both win greater political freedoms and preserve Hong Kong’s special identity. “Reclaim Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Time,” the movement’s defining credo, was coined by jailed activist Edward Leung, a former member of Hong Kong Indigenous. (Ironically, Leung, who argued for tighter borders and even full independence, was born in Wuhan.)\n\nAfter adopting Leung’s clarion call, some protesters also embraced his advocacy of more militant tactics. Violence, once dismissed as extreme, has become largely accepted as the only way to pressure a sclerotic regime because of the lack of other viable outlets.\n\nSamson Yuen, an expert on social movements at Lingnan University says that, in Hong Kong, people cannot directly elect their leader or legislature, yet are deeply fearful of falling under authoritarian Beijing’s control. “It’s really a symptom of how ill the whole political situation is,” he says. “If there was democracy, people wouldn’t be throwing petrol bombs on the street.”\n\nCoronavirus is just the latest trigger. At a protest-aligned restaurant in the buzzing shopping and entertainment district of Tsim Sha Tsui, diners say they feel more comfortable now that Mandarin-speakers are barred from the establishment. The entrance is covered with pastel-colored Post-It notes expressing support for Hong Kong’s autonomy and exhorting fellow customers to “stay healthy.” People wait in line for a table, even as neighboring eateries sit empty.\n\n“Hongkongers don’t have a choice about our government, about our freedom. But for eating at least, we do,” says Keith, a 33-year-old patron.\n\nAnd while coronavirus paranoia is certainly not unique to the city, the outbreak provides yet another vehicle for Hongkongers to distinguish themselves from mainland Chinese.\n\n\n\n“I blame China for it,” says 23-year-old Karmen, echoing old prejudices. “They eat everything there. We don’t do that.”\n\n\n\nThis “racialization” says Andrew Junker, a sociologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, could prove dangerous amid the violent protest tactics that have become normalized in recent months.\n\n“The dehumanization of the mainland Chinese makes it easier to engage in violence and to believe in an IRA-style separatist ideology and militantism,” he says, referring to the Irish Republican Army, a paramilitary organization that waged a terrorist campaign to drive the British out of Northern Ireland until the 1998 Good Friday Agreement ended most of the conflict.\n\nIt seems like a long way from the once troubled streets of Belfast to Lo Wu station. But two homemade explosive devices were found there on Feb. 2; shortly afterward, an anonymous message on social media threatened mainland Chinese arrivals.\n\n“You come to our city to spread germs, but have you considered clearly if you would be able to continue living if you cross the border?” it said.\n\n“I protect my city, [you are] welcome to personally experience the force of a bombing.”\n\n— Additional reporting by Hillary Leung / Hong Kong\n\nWrite to Laignee Barron at Laignee.Barron@time.com."

            "content": "Trailblazers Photo Courtesy: Trailblazers Presents, LLC\n\nWarren Bobrow- WB: Please tell me about Trailblazers. How did it start? What is your overarching mission?\n\nTrailblazers=T: Trailblazers is a curated community of cannabis business and cultural leaders who work to advance the industry, unified by a shared ethos and vision of the future. We believe cannabis is on the precipice of transforming the human experience. Whether it’s disrupting the $50 billion pain management industry, addressing the injustices faced by millions of people who have been wrongly incarcerated, or bringing hope to those who suffer from anxiety, depression, and other ailments, the federal legalization of cannabis has the ability to touch everyone’s life in a meaningful way. It’s not a question of if this impact will occur but how, and whether the cannabis industry will put profit before purpose and blaze a new trail with conscious capitalism in mind.\n\nWe started Trailblazers to elevate this conversation among the industry’s top leaders, recognizing the value of collaboration instead of competition in order to push the cannabis industry to lead on the broader challenges that face our economy and planet. We learned a lot from our experience at Summit Series, producing events for multi-disciplinary leaders and curating unique learning environments infused with adventure. We love helping people connect with their peers and grow personally, professionally and spiritually. We get joy out of creating value for our members, whether that is helping them raise money, think about ways to reduce their carbon footprint, meeting their next co-founder or building the partnership that launches their brand to market.\n\nWe believe in the power of cannabis as a tool to drive positive social change in our society. Trailblazers’ mission is to shape the future of the industry and support the growth of new markets and opportunities.\n\nTrailblazers Photo Courtesy: Trailblazers Presents, LLC\n\nWB: What makes Trailblazers different from other industry events?\n\nT:Trailblazers is an invite-only inclusive event series that has turned into a powerful community for cannabis and hemp executives to gather and trade ideas that will have a lasting impact worldwide. In relation to other industry events, there are three factors that make Trailblazers truly unique: our social impact, non-transactional environment and immersion in nature.\n\nSocial Impact: We are committed to creating a lasting impact and make sure that every conversation that is sparked at our events has an action plan. Our community is rooted in conscious capitalism and our fellowship program brings attendees from diverse backgrounds and practice areas. We believe that diversity drives innovation, and we pride ourselves on fostering a community of emerging leaders that thrives on inclusion to drive positive social and environmental change.\n\nNon-transactional Environment: Our events are intentionally designed for people to create real relationships by having fun and being active together, not just meet new contacts or walk away with a handful of business cards. We thoughtfully connect with every person who is interested in attending to better understand if they’re a good professional and cultural fit. We help attendees build strong personal relationships and if we’re able to do that in a highly curated environment, the business figures itself out pretty easily.\n\nImmersion in Nature: We will never produce an event in a hotel lobby. We create events that allow people to get into their bodies and connect with the beautiful outdoors. Our event in the winter is filled with endless powder skiing and snow activities atop Powder Mountain’s 10,000 acre resort in Eden, UT. In the summer, we facilitate programming infused with mountain biking, hiking and lake activities like paddle boarding, wake surfing and swimming.\n\nWB: I was reading about your partnership with the Wholistic Research and Education Foundation. How did that come about?\n\nT: We started Trailblazers to mobilize leaders around the most important issues of the emerging cannabis and hemp industry: science and research, environmental stewardship and equality. A key takeaway from our inaugural event in March 2019 - where Dr. Jeff Chen, the founder and executive director of UCLA Cannabis Research Initiative raised $50K on the spot after his talk - was the need to support clinical research and evidence based education in medical cannabis. It was clear that the community viewed it as a missing link to establishing trust and credibility in the industry. Initially we considered starting our own Foundation, and then we met Pelin Thorogood and her team at Wholistic.\n\nWith a mission to explore how and why cannabis delivers its diverse health benefits, the Wholistic Foundation had already funded more than $6 million to drive some of the most innovative medical and scientific research we’d heard of. They had attracted some world-renowned doctors and researchers to their Medical Advisory Committee, and perhaps most important to us, they had a Venture Philanthropy approach that took a deep, long-term view into what it means to invest in cutting-edge cannabis research and education to improve public health and safety. It was a natural fit for us to establish a meaningful partnership with this trailblazing public non-profit given all the synergies.\n\nIn addition to Wholistic, we are in the process of building an environmental stewardship and sustainability initiative that we will be workshopping in March 2020, working on a political advocacy campaign with a new brand called Union Electric and partnering with several organizations on criminal justice and expungement initiatives.\n\nWB: What can people expect at the upcoming Trailblazers III in Powder Mountain?\n\nT: Guests can expect a weekend getaway at Powder Mountain’s 10,000 acre resort in Eden, UT. It’s three days and nights of curated programming including over ten workshops/content sessions led by our Trailblazers. We’ll have wellness activities, powder skiing with pro skier Lexi Dupont, one-of-kind dining experiences with Michelin-trained Chef Haru Kishi and live music performances. As event producers, we are good at creating a container and designing space, but the real magic is in the people who show up and who make up this community. Every person who comes to Trailblazers is attending for a different reason and we do our best to create an ecosystem to meet all those needs. Someone once said, “water seeks its own level,” and we think that’s the easiest way to describe it.\n\nAt every event, we hone in on 5-7 key pillars that we've identified as the most relevant current and future-looking topics in the cannabis industry. This year, those pillars are Policy & Regulation, Science & Medical Research, Consumer Product Innovation, Social Justice, Investments, Environmental Sustainability and International Markets.\n\nWB: Thinking about the future, what are your 6 and 12 months goals?\n\nT: Like any nascent industry, it’s hard to imagine what the landscape will look like six to twelve months from now. One thing is certain: our mission won’t change with the ebbs and flows of the industry. We are committed to being in service for the executives and leaders who truly believe in the power of the cannabis plant. Our goal over the next year is to really scale the community with new events, expand our global footprint and broaden our audience to include a more diverse group of business leaders."

            "content": "The analyst firm, IDC, has forecasted that worldwide spending on information and communications technology (ICT) will reach $4.3 trillion in 2020 – that’s 3.6% over 2019. The majority of the spending ($2.7 trillion) will come from the private and public sector while the rest will come from consumer spending.\n\nJudging by comments from IDC’s Serena Da Rold, program manager in IDC’s Customer Insights and Analysis group, the spend figure may have been higher if there were more favourable conditions:\n\n“The slow economy, weak business investment, and uncertain production expectations combined with protectionist policies and geopolitical tensions — including the US-China trade war, threats of US tariffs on EU automobiles and the EU's expected response, and continued uncertainty around the Brexit deal — are still acting as inhibitors to ICT spending across regions.”\n\nIDC said that IT spending will make up more than half of ICT spending this year driven by the purchases of mobile phones. PCs, and enterprise applications. It said that IT services will contribute $750 billion to the figure as more organisations digitise. On the telecommunications front, over one-third of ICT spending for the year will come from this sector. Mobile telecom services and fixed telecom services will be the biggest contributors to telecommunications spend and see growth in the low single digits.\n\nDelivering over 40% of commercial ICT spending in 2020 are the banking, discrete manufacturing, professional services, and telecommunications industries. Where they spend their money varies, for example, IT services will be a big part of spending for all of the industries, representing 50% in banking, 26% in professional services, and somewhere in-between for the other two.\n\nThe analyst said that while banking and discrete manufacturing spend on applications, telecommunications and professional services will be investing in infrastructure. It’s hardly a surprise to hear this about telecommunications with 5G rollouts commencing all over the world.\n\nOne noticeable aspect not mentioned by IDC is the COVID-19 outbreak currently affecting production in China. Just today, Neowin reported that Apple was adjusting its revenue guidance due to production facilities opening slower than it expected. If the virus continues to be a problem we could see IDC’s figures completely thrown off."

            "content": "For people who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, the disease that has swept parts of China and may have gained a foothold elsewhere, the global economic impact is likely the least of their concerns.\n\nBut with the world economy already hovering near what the International Monetary Fund considers to be recessionary levels, a significant global slowdown would be about more than money. And one of the biggest considerations is whether the economic impact of the disease will be ephemeral or lasting.\n\nWidely described as the biggest current threat to global growth, the coronavirus, and perhaps more important the things governments are doing to prevent it from spreading, could yet push the world below the recession line.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why experts like Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer, worry that draconian measures that stoke fear in the population do more harm than good.\n\nRecession also kills\n\n\"Recessions kill people, in fact will probably kill more people than this virus does,\" he told CBC News host Michael Serapio last week.\n\nHere in the wealth and safety of Canada it may be hard to fathom, but in a globally integrated economy a few dollars less a month can mean life or death to people struggling for food and medicine. That's easier to comprehend when you think that the World Health Organization estimates about six million children a year die preventable deaths, usually associated with poverty.\n\nWATCH: Ontario's ex-chief medical officer says a recession could kill more people than the coronavirus:\n\nOntario's former chief medical officer says a recession caused by the coronavirus could kill more people than the disease. 0:56\n\n\"Our world has become so interconnected,\" says Jia Wang, deputy director of the University of Alberta's China Institute.\n\nWang suggests that the next few weeks will be critical, showing whether the epidemic, with its global economic impact, is moderating or getting worse. Early reports that the spread of the disease was slowing were cast into doubt last week when China reported 5,000 new cases and global deaths leapt past 1,500.\n\nFear and government restrictions mean people in China have been staying home, slashing the business of retailers and restaurants. Some reports say property sales are down by more than 80 per cent, affecting a business that represents about one-quarter of China's gross domestic product.\n\nWang says that while the country's giant companies are big enough to outlast the crisis, especially with government help, a significant and dynamic part of China's economy is based on much smaller businesses that could disappear, leading to lingering economic effects.\n\nSurvival at stake\n\n\"If the quarantines and shutdowns of many cities around China continue for a few more months or even just one month, many of the smaller companies may not survive,\" she said.\n\nWang says there are also worries that the coronavirus and its economic effect will spread outside China. Last Friday, Singapore's president, Lee Hsien Loong. warned the disease could push that country into recession.\n\nPutting a figure on the global impact is not easy, and estimates of the damage vary widely. Oxford Economics says global growth will fall to 2.3 per cent in 2020, the lowest level in more than 10 years and below the IMF's global recession level.\n\nLast week Canada's Parliamentary Budget Office suggested the epidemic would eat into Canada's growth rate in the first three months of the year chopping off 0.3 percentage points.\n\nThat worries Brian Kingston from the Business Council of Canada, especially when no one knows when the crisis will end.\n\nFloating prison? This cruise ship spent two weeks at sea running out of supplies after being turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard might be infected. (Soe Zeya Tun/Reuters)\n\n\"And remember that China is our second most important export destination,\" Kingston told Piya Chattopadhyay on CBC Radio's Metro Morning.\n\nBMO economist Jennifer Lee says the bank has again downgraded the Chinese economy due to fading optimism that the country can get its factories geared up as soon as it had hoped.\n\n\"We've shaved Q1 and Q2 growth,\" said Lee, \"given how long the shutdowns are lasting.\"\n\nLee says the bank still expects China to rebound from the economic malaise, though BMO now puts Chinese full-year growth for 2020 at 5.3 per cent. That is far below the previous consensus that China would grow this year at between six and 6.5 per cent.\n\nFleeting effect?\n\nBut Lee says it is common for economies to rebound even after the sharpest decline. For example, a month of storms may mean Canadians stay home from the shops, but the money they didn't spend in one month they can spend in the next, causing what looks like a boom.\n\nThat depends on how much damage is done and whether it can heal. And Lee says the duration of any interruption in business makes all the difference. She says that after the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Canadian economy bounced back with very little overall damage.\n\n\"I don't think anyone has any idea of whether or not this is going to be resolved any time soon,\" said Lee.\n\nJust as in the recent trade war, uncertainty may be having a paralyzing effect on businesses that are waiting to see whether the availability of parts and the demand for copper and Canada Goose coats will bounce back before firms are forced to completely change their strategies.\n\nFor some businesses, even a speedy recuperation of the global economy may not wash away the business impact of COVID-19.\n\nThe special deals already being offered by cruise lines for summer packages may not be enough to cleanse the lingering image of people being trapped for days on a plague ship in windowless rooms in what for many became floating prisons.\n\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis"

            "content": "Do Women-Only Networking Groups Harm Female Entrepreneurship? Getty\n\nResearch published last year highlighted the challenges women face when it comes to building their network. The research reveals that men who were in the right networks were around 1.5 times as likely to progress into leadership roles after graduating than men who were in the wrong networks.\n\nFor women however, there was no such premium, even if they were in the “right” network. Where networking did seem to be beneficial however is if they were in a social network that was primarily made up of women, in which case they were 2.5 times more likely to graduate to a leadership role after leaving school.\n\nSo one might imagine that women-only networking groups would be beneficial, but new research from the University of Edinburgh suggests things might not be so straightforward. Indeed, it argues that these groups may do more harm than good, especially in terms of supporting female entrepreneurs.\n\nNetworking barriers\n\nSome of these barriers were explored in recent research from Columbia University. The study analyzes the networks of a few thousand entrepreneurs, and comes to the rather depressing finding that decision makers appear to prefer male contacts when they’re making a third-party referral, especially in sectors that are dominated by men. This bias vanishes in fields that are either more gender neutral or more commonly associated with women, but that is scant consolation.\n\nThe research challenges the notion that if women aren’t getting value from networking, it’s because they aren’t doing it properly or are in bad networks. Instead, it suggests that there are fundamental biases at play that limit the potential of networking for female entrepreneurs.\n\n“We know that gender inequities happen all the time — men and women in the same job experience differences in outcomes,” the researchers say. “So why would we think that putting women in the same networks as men would lead to equal outcomes?”\n\nThe Edinburgh-led research finds that women-only networking groups are largely unable to overcome this kind of hurdle. The question is, does this really matter or do women-only networks provide other benefits to members?\n\n\"We cannot erase gender, ethnic or sexuality biases on our own, and so not having a dialog about these things and ignoring them really doesn't help,\" Sheila Flavell, COO of IT services company FDM, who sponsor the FDM Everywoman in Tech Awards, told me recently. \"It's not about making people feel bad, it's about celebrating diversity and raising awareness of the unconscious biases that do exist.\"\n\nFemale entrepreneurship\n\nData from the Boston Consulting Group has previously shown that startups run by women tend to perform better than average, and the scale of the potential was underlined by a follow up study from the group that explored what would happen to the economy if entrepreneurship rates among women were comparable with those among men.\n\nThe report suggests that if rates were broadly equal, then global GDP would grow by up to 6%, which would boost the global economy by an incredible $5 trillion.\n\nThe research from the University of Edinburgh took place in Northern Ireland, which is an area with lower female entrepreneurship rates than the rest of the U.K. It's a discrepancy that has been tackled head on by Invest NI, a regional development agency in the country.\n\nThe promotion and support of female entrepreneurship has typically been done via women-only networks that aim to provide entrepreneurs with role models, support and access to networks. The researchers spoke with entrepreneurs from these networks, together with those from mixed networks, and indeed those who are members of both types of network.\n\nThe conversations revealed that the aim of providing valuable networking opportunities was not met by a reality that saw these groups marginalized and stuck in a niche of female entrepreneurs rather than providing members with access to the kind of networks that are so vital to startup growth.\n\n\"Entrepreneurship policies targeted at women are contributing little or nothing to their equality, well-being or independence,\" the researchers say. \"Entrepreneurship is shaped for men, and successful entrepreneurs are male. Women are only deemed successful if they launch businesses in the 'right' (male-dominated) industries and match male-owned businesses for growth. Thus, women-only networks perpetuate the masculinity of entrepreneurship, by reinforcing women as being in the margins.\"\n\nBetter support\n\nThe research highlights the various challenges faced by female entrepreneurs, many of which I covered in a recent article. This is coupled by a lack of awareness of the sectors female entrepreneurs tend to focus on, which results in poor construction of the right networks to help them grow their businesses.\n\nAs such, the research found that the networks available to the entrepreneurs tend to be limited geographically, and provide more in the way of social support than any form of business development assistance.\n\nThis is a shame, as the interviews highlighted a real sense among female entrepreneurs of having to battle against a tide that sees entrepreneurship as a largely male domain.\n\n\"Strategies and policies focus on addressing failings or limitations unique to women, rather than on systemic, industry or institutional issues, perceiving a deficiency of perceived female underperformance,\" the researchers say. \"By treating women differently to men, treating them as a problem that needs to be fixed, and by creating women-only targeted initiatives, women continue to be marginalised. Many business structures are shaped for men, with women restricted in their entrepreneurial ambitions in the lower echelons of the retails and service sector, often referred to as 'pink ghettos'.\"\n\nThis is perhaps exacerbated by network managers who genuinely see themselves as part of the solution. Whereas they saw themselves as helping the entrepreneurs, the feeling was not matched by the entrepreneurs themselves, who often felt that the networks merely confirmed their status as second class citizens in the entrepreneurial world.\n\nThe failings of these support networks was also highlighted by the Columbia research, which suggested that female entrepreneurs would be better served going directly to the contacts they wished to meet rather than relying on intermediaries.\n\nWith the stakes quite so high should society prove better able to support female entrepreneurs, hopefully the uncovering of these findings will enable the support networks that do exist to move beyond providing lip service and actually help female entrepreneurs overcome the inequities society continues to place upon them.\n\n\"All parties need to identify, address and eliminate the various means by which cultural bias is perpetuated, restructuring the ways social institutions are conceived,\" the researchers conclude. \"If women's entrepreneurship continues to be seen as a gendered niche, aspirations for its impact will never be met.\""

Both contracts started the Asian session trading lower.China is struggling to get manufacturing back on line in the world's second-largest economy after imposing stringent city-wide lockdowns and travel restrictions in efforts to contain the virus.Official data showed new cases in Hubei province fell for a second straight day, although the number of deaths increased, and the World Health Organization earlier cautioned there was not enough data to know if the epidemic was being contained.Oil prices have risen as much as around 8% since hitting lows for this year just over a week ago, but another sharp downturn in prices could prompt the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and its allies to deepen supply cuts.The grouping, known as OPEC+, has been withholding supply to support prices and is meeting next month to decide a response to the latest downturn in demand resulting from the epidemic.OPEC+ wants to \"prevent the emergence of a large supply overhang caused by slumping demand amid the health crisis centred in China, the world's biggest importer of crude oil,\" Eurasia Group said in a note.In a further sign of widening fallout from the outbreak, Japan's exports in January were down for a 14th straight month as a gauge of capital spending tumbled.That came after data on Monday showed that Japan's economy contracted in the last quarter by the most since 2014, and the virus outbreak is threatening to push the world's third-biggest economy into recession."

            "content": "The history of American comics is strikingly easy to segment into decades, on the decade.\n\nThe 1940s saw the medium blossom into full stride for the first time, the ’50s captured an anarchic post-war mood upended by the Marvel Revolution in precisely 1961. The 1970s saw superheroes grapple with direct topicality for the first time. In the ’80s, comics became critically acclaimed grownup entertainment, while the ’90s saw a hard swing back to teen-focused excess and the chaos of a speculator boom and bust.\n\nEvery 10 years has its own overall tone, and artistic trends and printing techniques have combined to give each decade its own look as well. That is, until you get to the ’00s.\n\nKnow your Ages The Golden Age (1938-1956) The first boom and bust of superhero comics. The Silver Age (1956-1970) The second boom of superhero comics, the Marvel Revolution, the first era in which kids who grew up on superhero books were old enough to write them. The Bronze Age (1970-1984) A push for greater topicality and character depth, a surge of superheroines and heroes of color, the rise of soap opera team books like X-Men and Teen Titans, and the return of popular non-superhero monthly comics. The Modern Age (1984-) Literally everything from 1984 on.\n\nAmerican comics also have a recency problem. The medium’s history is traditionally divided into “ages,” ticking over into the Modern Age in 1984. But even comics scholars have yet to define the ’00s from what came before them, or the ’10s from the ’00s. In 2020, it’s technically been the Modern Age for 36 years.\n\nA comic artist or editor might pause when asked to define the the last 20 years of comics. I know, because I’ve asked some: With the third decade of the Modern Age approaching, Polygon picked the brains of comics industry veterans to understand how modern history shaped comics, and how comics have shaped modern pop culture.\n\nThe results were nothing short of fascinating. And while everyone had their own individual take, themes did emerge. Wonder Woman scribes Steve Orlando and Gail Simone talked about the 2010s’ wave of diversity, while Lee, DiDio, and their Marvel counterpart Tom Brevoort went long on the movement of superheros to pop culture tentpoles. Cartoonists Scott McCloud and Gene Luen Yang nodded to the rise of the YA graphic novel, while superhero gurus Scott Snyder and Geoff Johns laid out the renaissance of pure superheroics. Not to mention Al Ewing, Amanda Conner, Brian Michael Bendis, C.B. Cebulski, Colleen Doran, Bryan Hill, Jim Starlin, Kieron Gillen, and Liam Sharp, all weighing in with their take.\n\nBelow, we’ve grouped together select quotes by theme, some obvious, some that only experts in the field would have the keen understanding to see. If you want to read everything that everyone said, check out their full answers here.\n\nWhat defined the ’00s in comics?\n\nReclaiming the hero story\n\nScott Snyder (writer of Batman, Wytches, Justice League, Dark Nights Metal): I feel like the ’00s were about reminding people how great our classic characters are on all levels. It was about a reclamation, after the ’80s and ’90s, of deconstructing superheroes — to reconstruct them. Geoff Johns was a huge person in that, Grant Morrison’s a huge person in that, Bendis is a huge person in that. The generation right before me put them back together and said “This is why they’re great, in their corny, wonderful, superhero selves,” and created amazing new characters alongside that, that appealed to whole new audiences.\n\nGeoff Johns (writer of Green Lantern, Doomsday Clock, Shazam!, The Avengers): I remember specifically for me in the ’00s, I was really excited about a lot of the new voices coming up, like Brian Bendis and Greg Rucka. [After the ] ’90s where it was really flashy, over-the-top superheroes, and colorful. [The ’00s] was a bit of a grounding from that with some of that work. The work I did in the two thousands was — I call it — it’s like neoclassic, right? The JSA, Wally West/The Flash, I started Green Lantern in the mid-’00s. I really liked going back to the basics of what the concept was, while pushing them forward. Like the JSA, I always loved the idea of the Justice Society having roots in the ’40s in a first era, but really progressing and evolving and having legacy — because it’s such a huge part of DC Comics — and exploring that, but keeping the rich history.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001\n\nBryan Hill (writer of American Carnage, Killmonger, The Outsiders): I think the ’00s in comics are largely defined, like a lot of media, by living in a post-9/11 world. How do you tell stories about superheros when the real world seems to be absent of the ones we need? I think fiction had to catch up to that. In the 90s we were very safe. We were in this Clintonian economy where we were so safe that you can make a movie with Ed Norton about how Ikea was the biggest problem in your life. That felt safe. I shop at Ikea, so I need to get punched, you could make that movie.\n\nTom Brevoort (editor, Marvel Comics, senior vice president of publishing): More than anything else, I’d say [the definite movement of the ’00s] was a deepening of the concept of the “world outside your window” and the willingness of the various creators and companies to tell complex and sophisticated stories about the world we live in and the real world events therein. This all really started in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy, when comics were among the first entertainment media (due to our speed of production) to be able to effectively and emotionally deal with the aftermath of those attacks and the psychic scars that everybody was feeling. From there, as the decade went on, such stories with greater emotional depth became far more commonplace, and the biggest stories also tended to be those that were the most hard-hitting in terms of their story content (even though that content was often expressed through allegory.)\n\nSuperheroes go mainstream\n\nJim Lee (artist of Uncanny X-Men, Batman: Hush, Justice League; co-publisher at DC Comics): When I think about [the year] 2000 and Spider-Man coming out, the X-Men movies and all these things, the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the expectation for what superheroes are, everyone embracing the characters but not necessarily ... sort of the rise of superheroes becoming a cornerstone of pop culture. I know that’s not necessarily the comic books, but I think it plays into the story of “We didn’t rise as that water level rose.” Right?\n\nI think, since then, publishers have been challenging themselves with [the question of] “How do we catch this wave?” How do we get out there on the periodical side and capture so much of the obvious passion and interest in these characters?\n\nDan Didio (writer of Metal Men, Sideways; co-publisher at DC Comics): We were talking about [the] “I Read Banned Comics” [sticker]; you gotta remember in the ’50s all comics were going to be banned. It wasn’t about a particular character or story, it was about a medium that they were trying to shut down. So it’s an intriguing question because, ultimately, we were the counterculture and now we’re the pop culture. That’s the weird shift for us, because in order to maintain our identity, we still have to push against the norm in some way. That is, I think in some ways, necessary.\n\nAl Ewing (writer of Ultimates, Immortal Hulk, Loki: Agent of Asgard) The ’00s felt like the “Hollywood Decade.” “Widescreen” and “cinematic” became the new normal in terms of style, and the content became a strange mix of the grown-up and the childish, an attempt to get in tune with the new political zeitgeists while trying to compete awkwardly with the internet as a source of fetish porn. So many things felt “ready for the movie,” subconsciously getting the plots and costume designs and casting in place ahead of a world where the movies were finally ready to close the distance and become comics, complete with shared universes, crossovers and line-wide events.\n\nSteve Orlando (writer of Midnighter and Apollo, Wonder Woman, Virgil): With Morrison and Quitely at the wheel, [X-Men] pushed forward the mutant concept in bold and innovative ways — though it was one of the first books to react to a film, it also did it the best out of the gate, summing up what we would come to know is the challenge of working on a comic while the characters appear in other media: we must welcome readers from outside comics, but we also have to be bigger and bolder than film, tv, or video games, we have to offer that much more creativity to show them there are things they can only get in a comic book. [...] The 00s put more eyes on superheroes than there had been in decades, mainstream eyes, and comics had to go through a period of change, its own secondary mutation, to maintain its place as the home of creativity and innovation.\n\nWhat defined the ’10s in comics?\n\nEven more mainstreaming\n\nScott Snyder: With the rise of indie comics in 2010 with The Walking Dead and Image and all of that stuff, too, I feel suddenly we were in an environment where it was almost like, OK, everyone loves comics now. Between the movies, indie stuff, superhero comics, everyone loves the characters, everyone loves the adaptations of these things. Now we have to make things, between 2010 and now — It’s been a struggle to figure out how to write things that both appeal to your longtime readers but also bring in new readers and appeal to a sense of individuated readership that says we want something we haven’t seen before.\n\nTom Brevoort: At this point, the defining feature of comics in the 2010s is the fact that they sit at the center of the entirety of all of pop culture. Whether it’s at the box office, on broadcast or streaming, at the toy store or the theme park, the characters and stories that originated in comics have permeated the rest of the culture on every level. It wasn’t all that long ago that a superhero film or television series was a rarity, and was often seen as fodder for a very specific niche audience.\n\nSocial media\n\nAl Ewing: [The ’10s marked a] return to psychedelia and love, pitted against the last helpless gasp of the Olde Ways, with the dread Social Media fighting on both sides like Two-Face, always ready to ally himself if the coin-flip is right, but never to be mistaken for the hero. The story of the tens is a story of young people of all ages, all sick of grandad’s wanky lads-mag solipsism, all aching to throw their shoulder to the wheel and tell stories that speak to them and for them and the people they know. And — slowly, against some particularly creaky and cobwebbed resistance — it feels like the wheel has turned, at least a little.\n\nLiam Sharp (artist of Judge Dredd, Incredible Hulk, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern): It was also the decade when comic fandom got toxic on Twitter, creating new tribes and new camps. Some felt it had become too progressive and screamed for comics that resembled precisely the era they most loved growing up — usually the bombastic excesses of the ’90s. But many others enjoyed the growing diversity, the rise in the number of female creators, and the moment Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel became arguably more relevant than they had ever been. [... B]old storytelling came under siege if it was perceived to have strayed too far from the canonical and sacrosanct rhythms and rules of past times. Comic couples were now part of shipping wars. Batman stopped being a Playboy — such unreconstructed modes now passé and out-of-step with an increasingly progressive world-view. To some the comics were growing up, to others they were getting too woke and politically correct. Creators began to second-guess their creative visions, while fandom started to feel it could back-seat drive the entire industry via the medium of Twitter.\n\nNew, diverse talent and characters\n\nAmanda Conner (artist and/or writer on titles including Before Watchmen: Silk Spectre, Harley Quinn, Power Girl): I feel [that] this decade a lot of female superheroes came to the forefront. It was a very, very girl power decade for comic books. Also, and this has like been going on for the past 20 years is that when I first started working in comics — and even when I was reading comics as a little kid — there were really not that many girls reading comics. You would go to a convention in the late eighties and the early nineties and the only girls that you saw at comic book conventions were usually being “burros.” They were pack mules for whatever guy was the comic collector — and it was their mom or their girlfriend or their sister or their cousin, Hey, come to this call with me, I need you to carry all this crap for me while I get it signed. And every once in a while there would be an actual female comic reader. Now girls read comics across the table and it’s great. It’s really good. There’s more female creators, there’s more female readers. I feel like this decade has been a very, very girl power decade, which is great.\n\nC.B. Cebulski (editor in chief, Marvel Comics): In the ’10s, it’s been an amazing time for discovering new talent; never before have we seen so many “ready for prime time” new creators writing and/or drawing comics, both independent and mainstream, from around the globe, adding a diversity of new voices to storytelling in both the print and digital mediums.\n\nColleen Doran (writer and/or artist on Sandman, A Distant Soil, Wonder Woman): Girls becoming a big part of American comics. I’ve been in comics since, well, longer than I care to admit, and this has never been a thing in my lifetime. There were a few women in comics, but it was really a queen bee set-up, and it wasn’t necessarily very welcoming. Now, women and girls in comics are not just becoming the norm, but a major creative and financial force. Without the financing, without the economic power, it was always going to be stops and starts. But women creators now make up a major financial segment of the market, and have some of the best selling books in both the direct market and the retail trade.\n\nGail Simone (writer on Birds of Prey, Batgirl, Wonder Woman, Deadpool): I think it’s the era where we sort of gave mainstream comics back to EVERYONE. There was a time when girls comics sold in huge numbers, where kids’ comics competed with Batman directly and often won. Somewhere along the line, we focused SO MUCH on the core superhero customer base (not talking about independent comics, here), that we sort of abandoned those other audiences. In other countries, this wasn’t the case.\n\nSo, yeah, it’s been a couple decades of great superhero comics, but also, the rise of people like Kelly Sue DeConnick and Marjorie Liu and G. Willow Wilson and it shows … print is struggling all over, but most of the breakthrough titles have been very welcoming to newbies. Which I love. I have devoted a huge chunk of my life to comics, I want it to be open for everybody.\n\nKieron Gillen (writer on Young Avengers, The Wicked + The Divine, Star Wars: Darth Vader): The most defining elements of the 10s is the increasing diversity in the books. I don’t just mean the cast or (as the decade went on) the creators, but in terms of the sort of stories you could tell. There’s a lot of what I’ll describe as quirkpop books, which tended to find their audience in trades rather than the traditional marketplace. Hawkeye and Squirrel Girl are two which leap to mind, but the playfulness of Ms. Marvel is simultaneously new while also being a pure statement of elements which were definitive to the earliest Marvel superhero books.\n\nJim Starlin (writer and/or artist on The Infinity Gauntlet, Batman, Captain Marvel): Every few decades there’s a whole influx of new people coming in. During the ’70s we radically changed comics, people were coming in and replacing all those cartoonists and writers who were the mainstay of the industry back from thirties and forties. My generation is being replaced now with a new generation, there’s always going to be something innovative coming in as long as the creative people keep getting hired, that’s the big trick. Getting the right people to do the right job. It’s not so much the characters as it is the people who tell the stories of the characters.\n\nSteve Orlando: The ’10s, then, were also about a transition, but in this case it was the slow work (slower than it needed — or needs — to be at times) of updating our heroes to meet the modern moment. Diversity in creators, diversity in characters, and also in format — more YA and Middle Grade OGNs, more digital access, pushing back into stores outside the direct market. The attention of the ’00s showed us more people than ever love these heroic narratives, they demand, and deserve, to be the star, not the supporting player. In the 10s, that fight for representation took center stage, and it’s ongoing now.\n\nBrian Michael Bendis (writer on Spider-Man, The Avengers, Superman, Alias, Powers): you can feel some of our audience is more traumatized and stressed out about the real world than they ever have been before and they come to us sometimes for total escape. I can feel it with my Superman readers. Take me to a world where the good guys win. I think about that … a lot.\n\nI’m also seeing a great deal of creators from almost all walks of life pushing themselves to see how far they can push the medium. That’s a very good sign for things to come.\n\nYA graphic novels\n\nScott McCloud (writer and artist on Understanding Comics, Reinventing Comics, Making Comics): Raina [Telgemeier] has transformed the industry and the art form for years to come. She’s the apex of the middle-grade and kids’ comics revolution, creating armies of new readers (conveniently feeding into the YA market!) and subtly altering American comics’ storytelling priorities — adopting an emotion-as-action rhythm far more satisfying to mainstream readers than the stuff-it-in-a-word balloon style of silver age superhero comics. Whole generations of cartoonists and readers will live in the house that Raina built. That most will be women and girls is especially exciting, and long-overdue.\n\nGene Luen Yang (writer and/or artist on American Born Chinese, Superman, Avatar: The Last Airbender): The ’10s was a huge decade for comics as a medium. Graphic novels for young people exploded, in part because of creators like Raina Telgemeier, Vera Brosgol, and Kazu Kibuishi. When I was young, maybe a handful of kids in every classroom read comic books. Today, it’s hard to find a single kid under the age of thirteen who hasn’t read Raina Telgemeier’s Smile. Everyone reads graphic novels."

            "content": "China, in short, is providing a life lesson for the rest of us in how to respond to a crisis.\n\nWhile the US was bailing out every bank in sight with lower interest rates and loan guarantees, China upped the ante by ordering pretty much every sector of its economy to start building things with borrowed money.\n\nWhen the US housing bubble burst in 2007, most observers were focused on the threat to Wall Street banks and their massive derivatives books. This was a legitimate fear, since the worst-case scenarios involved the death of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), with all the stock market carnage that implied.\n\nBut for China the stakes were a lot higher - picture half a billion people taking to the streets and demanding an end to a government whose only claim to legitimacy was its ability to provide millions of ever-more-lucrative jobs.\n\nSo while the US was bailing out every bank in sight with lower interest rates and loan guarantees, China upped the ante by ordering pretty much every sector of its economy to start building things with borrowed money. The result was the biggest infrastructure binge in history, in which roads, bridges, airports, and - hey, why not - entire new cities sprang up in just a few years, providing jobs for millions of would-be rioters and a torrent of cash flow for foreign suppliers of iron ore, copper, cement, steel, lumber, and every other industrial commodity you can name.\n\nChina boomed, the rest of the world recovered, and today's longest-ever economic expansion was born. And Chinese debt-to-GDP soared to record-high levels.\n\nNow dial back the perspective to that of a single hypothetical family. Say one of the breadwinners loses their job and the family's income is cut in half. They can choose to scale back their spending to match their newly-diminished circumstances and accept the resulting turmoil of fewer cars, smaller houses, public rather than private schools, etc. Or they can max out a series of credit cards and just go on as before, avoiding stress in the moment at the cost of bigger bills - and greater fragility - in the future.\n\nThe second strategy will work if the unemployed breadwinner gets a new job reasonably soon and - crucially - if no other crisis pops up that requires (now nonexistent) resources. No illness, no new job loss, no leaky roof, no wrecked car… and things might work out.\n\nNow zoom back out to China, which chose strategy number two and is currently \"rich\" but also way too leveraged to handle another shock to the system. Just in time for a pandemic that shuts down half the country. From Sunday's South China Morning Post:\n\nForget Sars, the new coronavirus threatens a meltdown in China's economy Never before has China paid such an economic price for an epidemic as it has done already with the coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and causes the disease now officially known as Covid-19. And the damage is spreading. It is obvious that the economic impact of Covid-19 will be far more severe than that of Sars, or any other previous epidemic. Whole cities have been locked down, effectively grinding some local economies to a halt since Beijing declared all-out war on January 23. Currently, 30 of China's 31 provinces have declared a top-level public health emergency, with all major cities and economic hubs effectively shut for weeks. The government has locked down 56 million people in quarantine in Hubei, banned tens of millions more from travelling across the nation, and imposed restrictions on activities in most urban areas. The Lunar New Year holiday has been extended for one or two weeks for most of the country. At the peak, provinces accounting for almost 69 per cent of China's GDP were closed for business, according to Bloomberg Economics. For the millions of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China, the nightmare may be just beginning. Many small manufacturers fear foreign customers will shift orders to other countries due to disruptions in production and delivery. In a survey of 995 SMEs by academics from Tsinghua and Peking universities, 85 per cent said they would be unable to survive for more than three months under the current conditions. If the disruption goes on long enough, it could trigger a wave of bankruptcy among SMEs, which contribute more than 60 per cent of China's GDP, 70 per cent of its patents and account for 80 per cent of jobs nationwide.\n\nA financially solid country might be able to weather this kind of crisis by drawing down reserves and using its stellar credit to take on new, temporary debt. But an already over-leveraged system may not have those options.\n\nAs for what part of China's economy blows up first, check out the repayment schedule of municipal debt. These are the cities and states that borrowed immense amounts of money - much of it in US dollars - to build the previously mentioned roads, bridges, etc. Much of this infrastructure was already failing to generate cash flow sufficient to cover the related debt. Now those cash flows are drying up.\n\nChina, in short, is providing a life lesson for the rest of us in how to respond to a crisis. Remember it next time you think about maxing out a credit card.\n\nOriginal post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

            "content": "A comic artist or editor might pause when asked to define the the last 20 years of comics. I know, because I’ve asked some: With the third decade of the Modern Age approaching, Polygon picked the brains of as many comics industry veterans as we could, trying to understand how modern history has shaped comics, and how comics have shaped modern pop culture.\n\nWonder Woman scribes Steve Orlando and Gail Simone talked about the 2010s’ wave of diversity, while Lee, DiDio, and their Marvel counterpart Tom Brevoort went long on the movement of superheros to pop culture tentpoles. Cartoonists Scott McCloud and Gene Luen Yang nodded to the rise of the YA graphic novel, while superhero gurus Scott Snyder and Geoff Johns laid out the renaissance of pure superheroics.\n\nNot to mention Al Ewing, Amanda Conner, Brian Michael Bendis, C.B. Cebulski, Colleen Doran, Bryan Hill, Jim Starlin, Kieron Gillen, and Liam Sharp, all weighing in with their take.\n\nAl Ewing\n\nWriter of Immortal Hulk, Ultimates, Loki: Agent of Asgard.\n\nThe ’00s felt like the “Hollywood Decade.” “Widescreen” and “cinematic” became the new normal in terms of style, and the content became a strange mix of the grown-up and the childish, an attempt to get in tune with the new political zeitgeists while trying to compete awkwardly with the internet as a source of fetish porn. So many things felt “ready for the movie,” subconsciously getting the plots and costume designs and casting in place ahead of a world where the movies were finally ready to close the distance and become comics, complete with shared universes, crossovers and line-wide events. But at the same time, there was no shortage of diamonds amongst the lens flares — some of the great masters of the field doing career-best work, alongside the first shots across the bow from those who were cresting the hill, ready to take their place in the sun.\n\n[The ’10s marked a] return to psychedelia and love, pitted against the last helpless gasp of the Olde Ways, with the dread Social Media fighting on both sides like Two-Face, always ready to ally himself if the coin-flip is right, but never to be mistaken for the hero. The story of the tens is a story of young people of all ages, all sick of grandad’s wanky lads-mag solipsism, all aching to throw their shoulder to the wheel and tell stories that speak to them and for them and the people they know. And — slowly, against some particularly creaky and cobwebbed resistance — it feels like the wheel has turned, at least a little. Not that there isn’t a lot still to be done — speculation is once again nibbling seductively at the load-bearing beams of the industry, and the culture war that’s been on seemingly as long as I’ve been alive is still raging away, with the stakes getting higher all the time — but at least when it comes to this one genre of this one medium in this one quite small section of the world, I have hope that things are getting better. If the ’00s involved the first introductions to the people who shaped superheroes in the ’10s ... well, we’re getting some great introductions now.\n\nAmanda Conner\n\nArtist and/or writer of Before Watchmen: Silk Spectre, Harley Quinn, Power Girl.\n\nI can only speak for myself, because I worked on Harley since 2013. And in 2009 and 2010, we had worked on Power Girl, and I feel [that] this decade a lot of female superheroes came to the forefront. It was a very, very girl power decade for comic books. Also, and this has like been going on for the past 20 years, is that when I first started working in comics — and even when I was reading comics as a little kid — there were really not that many girls reading comics.\n\nYou would go to a convention in the late ’80s and the early ’90s and the only girls that you saw at comic book conventions were usually being “burros.” They were pack mules for whatever guy was the comic collector — and it was their mom or their girlfriend or their sister or their cousin, Hey, come to this con with me, I need you to carry all this crap for me while I get it signed. And every once in a while there would be an actual female comic reader. Now girls read comics across the table and it’s great. It’s really good. There’s more female creators, there’s more female readers. I feel like this decade has been a very, very girl power decade, which is great.\n\nBrian Michael Bendis\n\nWriter of Spider-Man, The Avengers, Superman, Alias, Powers.\n\nThe ‘00s: Truth. I know a lot of people will say diversity, in voice, experience and perspective, and that is true and I am so happy to have part of it. But it came in the form of everybody bringing their personal truth to their work. A lot of people saying: You know what i am NOT seeing reflected in my comics… and just doing THAT! So you had perspectives and experiences we’ve never seen reflected in popular superhero literature before sometimes coming at us simultaneously.\n\nThe ’10s: World building. Almost everybody I know is either actively publishing or about to release a brand-new world or universe that is different than the one we are living in right now. Obviously a reflection of our times in that you want to live somewhere else or in a better place or in a different place.\n\nAlso, you can feel some of our audience is more traumatized and stressed out about the real world than they ever have been before and they come to us sometimes for total escape. I can feel it with my Superman readers. Take me to a world where the good guys win. I think about that … a lot.\n\nI’m also seeing a great deal of creators from almost all walks of life pushing themselves to see how far they can push the medium. That’s a very good sign for things to come.\n\nBryan Hill\n\nWriter of American Carnage, Killmonger, The Outsiders.\n\nI think the ’00s in comics are largely defined, like a lot of media, by living in a post 9/11 world. How do you tell stories about superheros when the real world seems to be absent of the ones we need? I think fiction had to catch up to that. In the ’90s we were very safe. We were in this Clintonian economy where — we were so safe that you could make a movie with Ed Norton about how Ikea was the biggest problem in your life. That felt safe. I shop at Ikea, so I need to get punched, you could make that movie.\n\nI think when you look at the ’00s, you see a lot of the deconstruction of the archetype. I don’t think it’s a mistake that [the Borne films were] a major cultural influence, because it was a deconstruction of the sense of safety that government can provide in military action. And I think with comics, comics took a beat to grieve. The rest of the world was grieving and comics was kind of the same thing. But I think born out of that [was a] need to reexamine and deconstruct our relationship to these archetypes and to really examine what heroism means. I think we saw a rise in emotional depth when it came to these narratives. The emotional victories became as important as the plot victories in the ’00s.\n\nI think that’s one of the things you’ll see — and in the struggle to make Superman. What does the world need from Superman? How can we love him? How can we trust him? What is his meaning for us? You saw some of that stuff as well. Certainly saw it over on the Marvel side. With how the X-Men were being articulated and how that works, Spider-Man, and all that. It seemed like an emotional recalibration in a lot of ways. And mythology is like that; as we go through real world events and the mythology that we need changes a bit. They go through reformation periods. I think the ’00s were like a reformation period in comics. And a lot of it was transitional, transitioning into this balance of fantasy and verisimilitude — and that’s where we live currently, and I think is largely a good thing.\n\nI think the early ’00s were about reconciling with loss, and we needed fiction to recognize it with us. You start thinking about Ultimates, and all that stuff. We needed the fiction to do that. Almost like we needed the heroes to admit that they could fail, and to see those failures, so that we could trust them again. But now I think we’re looking more towards aspiration. And I think we’re, honestly, very similar to where culture was in the late ’70s. I don’t think it’s an accident that Star Wars is back in the public sphere, because Star Wars was a lot of how we shed the weight of the Vietnam War. And if you look at that, we had Vietnam, we had a lot of narratives that were about all the vagaries and the pyrrhic victories and the moral complexity and failings [of the Vietnam War], really delving into that. And then out of that sprouted a narrative wrought with basic ethics, and a belief in goodness and a recognition of evil. That’s where I think we’re going, I think that’s where we’re headed. Obviously it’s always tempered by nuance, but, yeah. I think we’re starting to get into that place where we’re ready to believe that a man can fly again. I think we want to look up at that building and see Batman standing on the corner of it, and we know that he’s there to protect us.\n\nC.B. Cebulski\n\nEditor in chief of Marvel Comics.\n\nFor me, comics are always boil down by the talent who makes them, and it was an increased focus on the talent that defined these two decades of comics in different ways. In the ’00s, for Marvel, our talent management group was formed to streamline recruitment and placement of writers and artists; give our talent the options and tools they need to help them build their creative careers, both for Marvel and their creator-owned books; help drive our stories and art forward with the best creators on the characters they wanted to be writing and drawing; and be a personal and professional resource for creators to answer any questions they may have to help them deliver the best work possible. This was a vast change from the previous system of each editorial office controlling and managing their own writers and artists, and offered more opportunities for the creative exploration while building a more cohesive Marvel Universe. Other companies have since looked at our efforts and started managing their talent in similar ways.\n\nIn the ’10s, it’s been an amazing time for discovering new talent; never before have we seen so many “ready for prime time” new creators writing and/or drawing comics, both independent and mainstream, from around the globe, adding a diversity of new voices to storytelling in both the print and digital mediums. And there’s no slowing down ... comics will only get more exciting, entertaining and enriching as talent from all walks of life across the world begin and continue telling their stories.\n\nColleen Doran\n\nWriter and/or artist of Sandman, A Distant Soil, Wonder Woman.\n\n[In the 2010s, girls became] a big part of American comics. I’ve been in comics since, well, longer than I care to admit, and this has never been a thing in my lifetime. There were a few women in comics, but it was really a queen bee set-up, and it wasn’t necessarily very welcoming. Now, women and girls in comics are not just becoming the norm, but a major creative and financial force. Without the financing, without the economic power, it was always going to be stops and starts. But women creators now make up a major financial segment of the market, and have some of the best selling books in both the direct market and the retail trade.\n\nI didn’t feel welcome or even normal in comics until the last few years.\n\nGail Simone\n\nWriter of Birds of Prey, Batgirl, Wonder Woman, Deadpool.\n\nI think [the ’10s are] the era where we sort of gave mainstream comics back to EVERYONE. There was a time when girls comics sold in huge numbers, where kids comics competed with Batman directly and often won. Somewhere along the line, we focused SO MUCH on the core superhero customer base (not talking about independent comics, here), that we sort of abandoned those other audiences. In other countries, this wasn’t the case.\n\nSo, yeah, it’s been a couple decades of great superhero comics, but also, the rise of people like Kelly Sue DeConnick and Marjorie Liu and G. Willow Wilson and it shows … print is struggling all over, but most of the breakthrough titles have been very welcoming to newbies. Which I love. I have devoted a huge chunk of my life to comics, I want it to be open for everybody.\n\nGene Luen Yang\n\nWriter and/or artist of American Born Chinese, Superman, Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nBeginning in the ’00s, movies figured out how to tell superhero stories as well as (or maybe even better than?) comic books. Previously obscure characters are now mainstream. I began reading comics in the ’80s, and I cannot tell you how weird it is to see a 10-year-old wearing a Rocket Racoon t-shirt at my kids’ school. Back in the day, you had to be a hardcore nerd to know who Rocket Racoon was.\n\nI didn’t read a ton of superhero comics in the ’00s, but it felt like some of them were trying to mimic the superhero movies. It’s a losing proposition, in my opinion. Movies and comics are two different media.\n\nThe ’10s was a huge decade for comics as a medium. Graphic novels for young people exploded, in part because of creators like Raina Telgemeier, Vera Brosgol, and Kazu Kibuishi. When I was young, maybe a handful of kids in every classroom read comic books. Today, it’s hard to find a single kid under the age of thirteen who hasn’t read Raina Telgemeier’s Smile. Everyone reads graphic novels.\n\nI have a theory about this. The reason (or at least one of the reasons) these graphic novels have become so popular is that they leverage the intimacy of the comics medium. Reading a masterfully-crafted graphic novel like Vera Brosgol’s Be Prepared is a bit like getting a peek into someone’s diary. All the lines are drawn by hand, you know? It’s very, very personal.\n\nAnd that personal connection is difficult to reproduce with CG on a big screen. (Not impossible, of course, but difficult.) It’s a strength that is unique to comics.\n\nWhat does this mean for superhero comics? In order to attract a younger audience, superhero comics have to figure out how to tell these sorts of personal stories. We were beginning to see this at the end of the ’10s. DC Comics has just started to put out some really exciting middle grade and young adult graphic novels. Mariko Tamaki and Steve Pugh’s Harley Quinn: Breaking Glass is one of my favorites. Kami Garcia and Gabriel Picolo’s Raven is absolutely killing it. (Admittedly, I am very, very biased because I’m doing work for this line.)\n\nI don’t think these graphic novels will replace monthly superhero comics, but they are incredibly important to building the next generation of superhero comic book fans — emphasis on “comic book.”\n\nGeoff Johns\n\nWriter of Green Lantern, Doomsday Clock, Shazam!, The Avengers.\n\nIt’s tough. I got into the business — really my career has been in the ’00s and this decade. So it’s hard for me to have a clear macro view of what the eras are defined as.\n\nI remember specifically for me in the ’00s, I was really excited about a lot of the new voices coming up, like Brian Bendis and Greg Rucka. [After the ] ’90s where it was really flashy, over-the-top superheroes, and colorful, [the ’00s] was a bit of a grounding from that with some of that work. The work I did in the ’00s was — I call it — it’s like neoclassic, right? The JSA, Wally West/The Flash, I started Green Lantern in the mid-’00s. I really liked going back to the basics of what the concept was, while pushing them forward.\n\nLike the JSA, I always loved the idea of the Justice Society having roots in the ’40s in a first era, but really progressing and evolving and having legacy — because it’s such a huge part of DC Comics — and exploring that, but keeping the rich history. I always loved the rich history of the DC Universe, so I always wanted to hold on to it. I never wanted to just reboot everything and start over. In the ’00s, I really remember that.\n\nBut I just remember creators I really loved from that era. And the ones that stood out, where the voices felt so new and fresh, were Bendis and Rucka. Those were two of my favorites. And obviously I love Grant Morrison, he was around in the ’90s too. But I look at that era — and that revitalization of Marvel, when [Joe] Quesada came in and they did Marvel Knights for a while and the Ultimate line started and there was a lot of interesting books out there. I just don’t know how you could summarize that in a couple of sentences. I’m not sure what that is.\n\nJim Lee and Dan DiDio\n\nLee is the artist of Uncanny X-Men, Batman: Hush, Justice League and co-publisher at DC Comics; DiDio is the writer of Metal Men, Sideways and co-publisher at DC Comics. The first interview conducted for this piece, it occured significantly earlier than the others, at San Diego Comic-Con 2018.\n\nDiDio: The weird part about right now there’s the same level of [generation] gap in discussion that there was in the late ’60s and ’70s, that I think we’re starting to get into. And if we’re smart, we’ll find a way to tap into that and really be able to explore it in a way that increases story.\n\nMy fear right now is the world is so nostalgic. Everything is nostalgia-based and therefore we’re almost feeding our own tail right now, in the sense that the nostalgia is what’s driving the conversation more so than looking forward. So it’s important for us to break free of that nostalgia feel and start to really carve a path moving forward.\n\nJim Lee: When did Spider-Man come out? It was 2002, I think? To me, [the ’00s were] the rise of superhero pop culture. It was comics moving out of being the source material of this media, and the characters themselves taking over pop culture. I think with the ’10s, it’s the rise of social media and that way that’s impacted how comic book creators create their stories, interact with their fans; the influence of populism and the voice of the internet.\n\nWhen I think about the ’00s and Spider-Man coming, out X-Men movies and all these things, the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the expectation for what superheroes are, everyone embracing the characters but not necessarily ... Sort of the rise of superheroes becoming a cornerstone of pop culture. I know that’s not necessarily the comic books, but I think it plays into the story of “We didn’t rise as that water level rose.” Right?\n\nI think since then publishers have been challenging themselves with [the question of] “How do we catch this wave?” How do we get out there on the periodical side and capture so much of the obvious passion and interest in these characters. And a lot of the stuff we’re doing, YA [books], the [DC Universe] subscription service, Black Label is all part of that strategy.\n\nDan DiDio: [In reference to the “I Read Banned Comics” sticker on my notebook] We were talking about “I Read Banned Comics,” you gotta remember in the ’50s all comics were going to be banned. It wasn’t about a particular character or story, it was about a medium that they were trying to shut down. So it’s an intriguing question because, ultimately, we were the counterculture and now we’re the pop culture. That’s the weird shift for us, because in order to maintain our identity, we still have to push against the norm in some way. That is, I think in some ways, necessary.\n\nJim Lee: I remember in 2005, Dan was the executive editor of DC and he was pushing me and Frank [Miller] to get All-Star Batman and Robin out to time it with Batman Begins. It was a struggle because I was kind of burnt out from having just done 12 issues of For Tomorrow. But again it was this notion of “What can we do on our side of the business to tie in to this growing love and obsession with the superhero movies?” So that’s what frames my narrative for that decade.\n\nDan DiDio: The reason why I did that, we had to put something out and I’ve had the same importance that the movie did. I didn’t want the movie to be driving Batman. And the only way we can put out something that would be comparable to that was to put out Frank Miller and Jim Lee together. So that way we stay relevant.\n\nJim Starlin\n\nWriter and artist of The Infinity Gauntlet, Batman, Captain Marvel.\n\nThis is actually something I’ve been giving some thought to. I think the market is going to be a big factor in determining where the future of comics go. I think you’re gonna see the pamphlets slowly disappearing; the little 22-page or 20-page books. There’s just not a system anymore where those are profitable. Most of those books are losing money.\n\nI think they are also going to be a lot — and they already have started to become — R and D for the movie industry or television industry. I think more people are already thinking about how they can do a story that can be adapted into a TV series or a movie, what-have-you.\n\nI believe we’re going to see things other than the superheroes to beginning to sprout. Possibly in horror, science fiction, what-have-you, that aren’t as prevalent right now in the market right now as they have been at other times and possibly will be in the future. Everything could change.\n\nWe’ve gone through so many radical changes since I started off in the ‘70s. The video games took away a huge amount of people who were reading comic books; movies and television have taken away and brought in new people. The collections are selling much better than the regular single issue books. It’s going to change, but I’m not Nostradamus so I’m not going to be able to give you a precise prediction on this one. It’s just my shot at it.\n\nDigital comics, which I didn’t touch on are becoming a major factor in the market. I don’t know what percentage they are of what the companies make, but I know it’s growing continuously. I believe it’s also happening with more independents. With the omnibus books we’re putting out, there is always an option to get the digital ones rather than the hard copy. We’re just going to have to adapt as we go along or we will fade away like the dinosaurs.\n\nEvery few decades there’s a whole influx of new people coming in. During the ’70s we radically changed comics, people were coming in and replacing all those cartoonists and writers who were the mainstay of the industry back from the ’30s and ’40s. My generation is being replaced now with a new generation, there’s always going to be something innovative coming in as long as the creative people keep getting hired, that’s the big trick. Getting the right people to do the right job. It’s not so much the characters as it is the people who tell the stories of the characters.\n\nKieron Gillen\n\nWriter of Young Avengers, The Wicked + The Divine, Star Wars: Darth Vader.\n\n[What defined the ’00s?] Two words: The Authority. Coming in the lead up to the decade decade it defined the visual trends (“widescreen”, objective presentation of action, the distant shot on action), the emotional tone (a lot of snarkers) and how its heroes were organised. For the last, I think of the era as the paramilitary age of superhero comics. The Authority were a military-cell of anarchists, but when its moves were lifted over to the Ultimates, you increasingly had a period where superheroes were primarily government workers. Everyone ended up in the Avengers, which means that everyone ends up working for the government. As a trend across the decade standard tropes like secret identities were downplayed in favour of moving the centre of interaction to be the workplace - the Bendisian Avengers breakfast scenes aren’t like the 1980s X-men ones — they’re firefighters eating at the firehouse. All this mixed well with the the other major defining trend of ’00s comics — namely, the return of the crossover, bigger than ever. Between those two aspects, you created the intellectual backdrop to the Marvel cinematic universe.\n\nIf you separate the still-continuing elements of the ’00s above, the most defining elements of the ’10s is the increasing diversity in the books. I don’t just mean the cast or (as the decade went on) the creators, but in terms of the sort of stories you could tell. There’s a lot of what I’ll describe as quirkpop books, which tended to find their audience in trades rather than the traditional marketplace. Hawkeye and Squirrel Girl are two which leap to mind, but the playfulness of Ms Marvel is simultaneously new while also being a pure statement of elements which were definitive to the earliest Marvel superhero books.\n\nPlus the triumphant march of cosplay, and other forms of fan engagement. This stuff all ties together and interlinks, but how a con looks in the ’10s is a different beast to how it looked in ’00s.\n\nLiam Sharp\n\nArtist of Judge Dredd, Incredible Hulk, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern.\n\nI really struggled in the ’00s” to figure out where I might be relevant. So much had changed and it seemed the industry itself was still recovering from the trauma of the ’90s and the huge collapse of the industry. There was definitely a lot of bleak views around! That said it did lead to a rise of creator-driven books and even publishing companies. Mam Tor, the company I co-founded, opened the field up to a slew of anthology titles with Event Horizon volumes 1 and 2. Image bloomed, and diversified. Comics based on computer games were top sellers — and again I got to be part of that with Gears of War, which was the biggest selling title of 2008 shifting 400K units. As for the superhero comics? It seemed to me they lost a little nerve, becoming slightly more pre-’80”s, with all that deconstruction, and a little safer, less bold creatively, while at the same time the productions values increased — along with costs. In some ways superhero comics seemed to be returning to a more traditional approach I think, though there was also the rise in long-form storytelling — stories that once occupied a single issue were now running over a whole year. We did see some masterworks too, like The Ultimates. And the move from the page to the screen also came of age. The movie-pitch as comic mini-series was absolutely perfected by certain creators in this era!\n\nThe ’10s saw the rise of digital comics - again something I contributed to when I co-founded the progressive digital storytelling company Madefire. Comixology absolutely changed the way we consume comics. But for me it was my chance to finally return to the superhero comics I loved when I got to work on Wonder Woman: Rebirth with Greg Rucka. It was also the decade when comic fandom got toxic on Twitter, creating new tribes and new camps. Some felt it had become too progressive and screamed for comics that resembled precisely the era they most loved growing up — usually the bombastic excesses of the ’90s”. But many others enjoyed the growing diversity, the rise in the number of female creators, and the moment Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel became arguably more relevant than they had ever been. The writers continued to dominate the medium in terms of name recognition for the second decade in a row, and bold storytelling came under siege if it was perceived to have strayed too far from the canonical and sacrosanct rhythms and rules of past times. Comic couples were now part of shipping wars. Batman stopped being a playboy — such unreconstructed modes now passé and out-of-step with an increasingly progressive world-view. To some the comics were growing up, to others they were getting too woke and politically correct. Creators began to second-guess their creative visions, while fandom started to feel it could back-seat drive the entire industry via the medium of Twitter.\n\nMy hope is that Twitter stops having such a negative impact moving forward. Creators need to take risks and sometimes break hearts. No creator should be hounded or threatened for daring to challenge the norm — it’s what art is meant to do! That does not mean it cannot also be an amazing story! I want my art cutting edge, and upsetting and even furious. I do not want a Groundhog Day of endlessly repeated tropes and cycles. We have to grow. We have to change.\n\nScott McCloud\n\nWriter and artist of Understanding Comics, Reinventing Comics, Making Comics.\n\n’00s: Chris Ware. Chris beautifully summed up the century just past, while offering a forward-looking thesis on the future. Comics history is filled with love, artistry, and excitement, but it’s also filled with a lot of regret, bitterness, and perversity. Somehow, Chris captured it all. And his spectacular inventions recall the beginning of the previous century—a 100 year echo of American comics’ auspicious debut in the Sunday page masterworks of cartoonists like Winsor McCay and George Herriman.\n\n’10s: Raina Telgemeier. Raina has transformed the industry and the art form for years to come. She’s the apex of the middle-grade and kids’ comics revolution, creating armies of new readers (conveniently feeding into the YA market!) and subtly altering American comics’ storytelling priorities—adopting an emotion-as-action rhythm far more satisfying to mainstream readers than the stuff-it-in-a-word balloon style of silver age superhero comics. Whole generations of cartoonists and readers will live in the house that Raina built. That most will be women and girls is especially exciting, and long-overdue.\n\nScott Snyder\n\nWriter of Batman, Wytches, Justice League, Dark Nights Metal.\n\nI think the biggest things [of the ’10s] to me are the popularization of geek culture. Suddenly everybody knows our heroes, right and left. A culture that was almost insular and small when I was a kid is now mainstream culture. There’s something so deeply inspiring and exciting about the potential of that on every level.\n\nIn terms of the comics themselves, I think the defining challenge is that right now people have the subjective choice to find so many different kinds of comics. Image and other independent companies have done a great job of bringing to light these incredible creator-owned projects that have become television shows, movies, all that stuff, or just made great comics.\n\nThe landscape of comics has become so vibrant and so diverse over the course of the last 10 years that it’s a blessing and a curse; in that there’s so many great things that people have to find what they like. And that’s a great thing for consumers and readers. And I also think it’s a challenge for us, in the way that we have to make sure that our stuff — if you’re doing corporate comics or superhero comics — pays off and is appealing and says This matters. This is relevant.\n\nIt’s not not a curse, it’s a challenge, is what I meant. It’s almost a blessing and a challenge. I feel like it makes us realize as creators that there’s such a sea of great stuff out there from all corners of the world all of a sudden. The industry has become something, to me, at least, that’s so vibrant and inclusive and varied that you have to make sure that the stuff you’re working on has a reason to exist and appeals to people in ways that are real, and personal, and relevant.\n\nTo me it just changed. It’s not just DC and Marvel giving you what they think works. The same way it is with television, film, music, everything, consumers have more choices and are used to a kind of subjective agency that I think is really new and revelatory and exciting. We have to adapt in a way that we’re giving them things that are just as diverse and exciting and just as varied and appealing as their tastes.\n\nI’m trying to think of what else I would say about like the kind of giant machinations of things. I’d almost say this, and then I’ll stop about it.\n\nI feel like the ’00s were about reminding people how great our classic characters are on all levels. It was about a reclamation, after the ’80s and ’90s, of deconstructing superheroes — to reconstruct them. Geoff Johns was a huge person in that, Grant Morrison’s a huge person in that, Bendis is a huge person in that. The generation right before me put them back together and said “This is why they’re great, in their corny, wonderful, superhero selves,” and created amazing new characters alongside that, that appealed to whole new audiences.\n\nThat kind of reconstructive project almost took us through the early ’00s into the 2010s and with the rise of indie comics in 2010 with The Walking Dead and Image and all of that stuff too, I feel suddenly we were in an environment where it was almost like, OK, everyone loves comics now. Between the movies, indie stuff, superhero comics, everyone loves the characters, everyone loves the adaptations of these things. Now we have to make things, between 2010 and now — It’s been a struggle to figure out how to write things that both appeal to your longtime readers but also bring in new readers and appeal to a sense of individuated readership that says we want something we haven’t seen before. That, to me, means we’re in a really fluid, exciting, transitional moment right now. To me it’s hugely exciting for all those reasons.\n\nTom Brevoort\n\nEditor, currently Marvel Comics’ senior vice president of publishing.\n\nMore than anything else, I’d say [the defining movement of the ’00s] was a deepening of the concept of the “world outside your window” and the willingness of the various creators and companies to tell complex and sophisticated stories about the world we live in and the real world events therein. This all really started in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy, when comics were among the first entertainment media (due to our speed of production) to be able to effectively and emotionally deal with the aftermath of those attacks and the psychic scars that everybody was feeling. From there, as the decade went on, such stories with greater emotional depth became far more commonplace, and the biggest stories also tended to be those that were the most hard-hitting in terms of their story content (even though that content was often expressed through allegory.)\n\nAt this point, the defining feature of comics in the 2010s is the fact that they sit at the center of the entirety of all of pop culture. Whether it’s at the box office, on broadcast or streaming, at the toy store or the theme park, the characters and stories that originated in comics have permeated the rest of the culture on every level. It wasn’t all that long ago that a superhero film or television series was a rarity, and was often seen as fodder for a very specific niche audience. But now, there are so many different television productions, so many different films based on comic book properties (not all of them superhero related) that it would be virtually impossible for somebody to watch them all. And super hero films have begun to transcend the limitations of genre, becoming regarded by some as true cinematic expressions the equal of any other story told in that medium. Be it Logan, Black Panther, Wonder Woman or Joker, we’ve seen how a broad mainstream audience has come to embrace our world and all of the wonderful things we create. And particularly, the 2010s are the decade of Marvel Studios, who have fielded an unparalleled slate of winning and interconnected features in such a way as to duplicate the experience of a comic book universe for the masses in film. A great achievement.\n\nSteve Orlando\n\nWriter of Midnighter and Apollo, Wonder Woman, Virgil.\n\nTo me, the ’00s were a time of transition in superhero comics, kicking off with the release of the X-Men movie, and the industry’s struggle to react accordingly. This was the time that brought us New X-Men, with uniforms in black and yellow to welcome potential new readers from the movie, but also with Morrison and Quitely at the wheel, the book pushed forward the mutant concept in bold and innovative ways — though it was one of the first books to react to a film, it also did it the best out of the gate, summing up what we would come to know is the challenge of working on a comic while the characters appear in other media: we must welcome readers from outside comics, but we also have to be bigger and bolder than film, tv, or video games, we have to offer that much more creativity to show them there are things they can only get in a comic book.\n\nWe’d push forward and fall back on this concept as the decade went on, but the ’00s to me were a time of transformation, where more attention than ever was on superhero characters, but the comics themselves struggled to adapt and find their new identity to meet and reward that attention. In many ways, we’re still working through this now. But the ’00s put more eyes on superheroes than there had been in decades, mainstream eyes, and comics had to go through a period of change, its own secondary mutation, to maintain its place as the home of creativity and innovation. Film and TV raised the bar, and in the ’00s, comics got smarter, bolder, wilder, and more innovative ... all to raise the bar in return.\n\nI think the ’10s will be defined by diversifying not just mainstream superheroes, but the formats in which those characters are offered. With mainstream attention has come new voices and new folks who deserve to be served by these iconic heroic narratives, as well as have the chance to step behind the scenes and craft them themselves. This was a natural and good result of superheroes going more mainstream into TV and Film, where more people can find out about them just like folks did back when superheroes were on newstands. The ’10s, then, were also about a transition, but in this case it was the slow work (slower than it needed — or needs — to be at times) of updating our heroes to meet the modern moment. Diversity in creators, diversity in characters, and also in format — more YA and Middle Grade OGNs, more digital access, pushing back into stores outside the direct market. The attention of the ’00s showed us more people than ever love these heroic narratives, they demand, and deserve, to be the star, not the supporting player. In the ’10s, that fight for representation took center stage, and it’s ongoing now. I think we’ll look back on this decade and see the progress we’ve made, but we’ll also look back and see we could’ve made a lot more if we’d been less precious and gotten out of our own way as an industry."

            "content": "Empty supermarket shelves in Hong Kong. Photo: Miguel Candela/Echoes Wire/Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nWith large swaths of China shut down and many other countries on edge, I spoke with business columnist Josh Barro about the economic misery that the coronavirus has inflicted on top of its death toll — and whether it’s about to spread Westward.\n\nBen: The financial damage caused by the coronavirus that has killed almost 2,000 is already considerable. China’s status as the world’s supply chain is being at least temporarily threatened; the tourism and travel industries are being battered; major companies like Apple are warning of slowdowns; international conferences and trade shows are being canceled. Yet the American stock market and other major financial indicators do not show signs of panic. Some argue that this is folly. “This will eventually end badly. I have never in my career seen anything as crazy as what’s going on right now,” Scott Minerd, global CIO of Guggenheim Investments, wrote. “The cognitive dissonance in the credit market is stunning.” Is it only a matter of time before much more serious economic fallout arrives from a disease that is hardly under control, and may continue to spread around the world?\n\nJosh: I’m not an epidemiologist, and neither are the vast majority of the market participants who are trying to figure out the likely economic impacts of coronavirus, and neither is Minerd. But my baseline assumption in these situations is that, because there is a major financial reward for getting the analyses right and penalty for getting them wrong, the market is providing the best aggregation of the available information. Which is to say, my guess is the market’s guess: that the global financial impacts of coronavirus will ultimately be limited in scope.\n\n“It is only a matter of time” is incorrect. It’s a matter of the spread of the disease — if there starts to be an uncontrolled spread of disease outside China, the global economic impacts will likely be major. If it’s essentially restricted to China, and if China is already starting to normalize (severe restrictions on activities remain in much of the country, but some factories are also starting to reopen) then the impacts will still be important, especially for companies that do a lot of business in China, but they shouldn’t be huge for the U.S. or for U.S. companies as a whole.\n\nBen: So it’s not possible, in your view, that we could see worsening economic effects as a sort of delayed reaction to what has already happened in China, given the global interconnectedness of everything in 2020?\n\nJosh: I think that should already be priced into stocks. And some of that has happened already — Apple announced it would miss its earnings targets because of trouble in China (both China disruption affecting the global supply of iPhones and weak Chinese consumer demand), and its stock fell. So did stocks of chipmakers that supply Apple and its competitors. To some extent, there will be catch-up production that offsets temporary disruptions. If iPhone demand in Germany is unaffected by coronavirus, but production delays disrupt iPhone supply, there should be more sales later to offset fewer sales now. Of course not all the lost consumption will get made up — for example, restaurants that lose revenue because people stay home during the outbreak won’t see that offset by people eating more meals later — but part of it will and that dampens the impact.\n\nIn some ways this is analogous to the effects of the trade war. Like coronavirus, the trade war has disrupted trade with China and has been negative for U.S. firms, especially those with a lot of exposure to the China market. But the overall effect on the U.S. economy hasn’t been large, because not all China trade got shut down, some trade just shifted to other suppliers, and most of the U.S. economy is either services or production for our own domestic consumption. Similarly in this situation, disruption in China has only so much effect on our economy — so long as the disruption really remains limited to China.\n\nBen: But for China, presumably, this will be a serious blow.\n\nJosh: Yeah. Part of the trouble with measuring it is that you can’t really trust Chinese government statistics, either about the economy or about public health. But yes, it is a major economic problem there, in addition to being a serious public health crisis. I was talking with Patrick Chovanec about this about two weeks ago — he said if the factory closures could really be kept to a week or two, there would be lots of the catch-up production I discussed earlier and the effects would be pretty small. But if they dragged on and on, a lot of firms would just start buying products from countries other than China. Since then, the factory reopenings have started, though they have been slower than expected. So that’s sort of an intermediate result — assuming the reopenings continue and weren’t premature. Still, the forecasts I’ve seen have the Chinese economy to continue growing, just more slowly than had been expected.\n\nBen: President Trump has been weirdly quiet about all this — when he has weighed in, it’s been to commend China’s response. Do you think this is because the negative economic effects he could create by sowing panic, which is his natural response, could hurt his reelection?\n\nJosh: His administration hasn’t been wholly disciplined on this issue. Wilbur Ross said trouble in China would make it easier to bring jobs back to the U.S. But Trump wants China to buy more American products, a goal that is undermined if China’s economy is too weak to support more demand for American products. I don’t think it helps him with his strategic objectives related to China to pile on.\n\nBen: What would be an indicator to you that things could get a lot worse, economically speaking?\n\nJosh: The worst possible thing would be uncontrolled transmission of the disease outside China. This would be a strong indicator that we should worry about a pandemic with major impacts on the economy (and human life) around the world. Scott Gottlieb, who until recently was the FDA commissioner, has been warning about the rising number of cases in Japan and Singapore. But it’s not yet clear whether these are likely to rise to an epidemic level there. That, I think, is the right place to watch. But again, the aggregated story from the financial markets seems to be that people are not that worried."

Getty\n\nWith automation, AI and other technology-driven changes to their workplaces, it’s a challenge keeping up with the training or educational requirements of the workforce. But perhaps upper-level executives could use an educational boost as well. As explained in a recent post, business leaders need to up their games in terms of digital transformation. Now, more industry surveys confirm that C-level executives could really use more education on business technology.\n\nMany business leaders are held back by a deficiency in digital savviness coupled with outdated mindsets, according to a study of 4,394 global business leaders out of MIT Sloan Management Review. “Executives around the world are out of touch with what it will take to win, and to lead, in the digital economy,” according to Douglas Ready and his co-authors. “Digitalization, upstart competitors, the need for breakneck speed and agility, and an increasingly diverse and demanding workforce require more from leaders than what most can offer.”\n\nThe MIT survey shows finds only 12% of executives strongly agree that their leaders have the right mindsets to lead them forward. In addition, only 40% agree that their companies are building robust leadership pipelines to tackle the demands of the digital economy. While 82% believe that leaders in the new economy will need to be digitally savvy, less than 10% of respondents strongly agree that their organizations have leaders with the right skills to thrive in the digital economy.\n\nAnother survey of 400 IT executives released by Logicworks finds more than four in five (84%) wish their company’s leadership better understood what IT does, and 76% think their company’s leadership doesn’t grasp how the cloud really works.\n\nHow can executives build their digital leadership abilities? The MIT researchers offer the following advice:\n\nBe bold and clear. “Articulate a powerful leadership narrative that courageously lays out what you believe is important for leading in the digital economy,” Ready and his co-authors state. “Don’t mince words. Be an authentic role model for the new leadership. A forceful, clear leadership narrative will send a message that it is high time to bring about change.”\n\nLook for potential. “Promote a culture that identifies future leaders early in their careers,” the authors advise. “Signal which people with which behaviors and mindsets best reflect the values expressed in your leadership narrative.”\n\nEmphasize community. “Build communities of leaders by empowering employees at all levels. Shed the baggage of dense hierarchies. Understand that your employees value and respect your ability to connect with them far more than your title.”\n\nBuild trust. “Make transparency and trust the cornerstone of your culture to unleash the energy that exists at every level and in every corner of your organization,” the MIT researchers state.\n\nDemand diversity. “The research is clear that diverse teams perform better, so stop talking about diversity and make it happen. Use data and insights to identify where diversity is lost and how to preserve it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

First, ask yourself a few questions: When you’re not helping others, do you feel anxious or aimless? Do you feel defensive or dismissive when you learn that the people you helped have found another’s advice helpful, or that they didn’t consult you on a problem? Do you often imagine helping others with life-changing advice? Answering yes to a few of the above doesn’t necessarily confirm you over-help, but it could indicate that it is something you should watch out for. Next, commit to being an equal partner, and not a savior. A telling sign of over-helping is when you find yourself doing more to help others than they do for themselves. You can also avoid dependency by measuring improvement. The greatness of a coach can be measured by their ability to help someone grow to a point of no longer needing them.\n\nFPG/Getty Images\n\nThere has arguably never been a better time for employees seeking professional guidance. With the rapid increase of coaches, consultants, and advisors in the workplace, as well as the popular, and growing, trend of “the leader as a coach,” getting access to help (for most) is no longer challenging. Those who work with coaches are often viewed as admirable, and leaders who bear the title themselves do so like a badge of honor — despite the fact that, just a few years ago, even asking for help was considered weak.\n\nThere are many benefits to this unfolding shift in organizational culture. Most notably, it will allow people to admit limitations without fear, and make learning both safe and expected. But could having so much help also have a dark side?\n\nRecently, I overheard someone exclaim, “I’m just a coaching addict! I love watching people have breakthroughs.” It turns out, this sentiment is not a unique one. Despite our many good intentions, it is indeed possible for coaches and leaders to over-help those seeking advice. In his book, The Advice Trap, author Michael Bungay Stanier explores our inherent obsession with giving advice. He says, “As soon as someone starts talking, our Advice Monster looms out of our subconscious, rubbing its hands and declaring, ‘I’m about to add some value to this conversation!’ The dangerous core belief underneath our Advice Monster is, ‘You’re better than the other person.’”\n\nBehavioral experts agree that “helping” does indeed have the potential to become an addiction. When we help others, our brains emit three chemicals, often referred to as the happiness trifecta:\n\nSerotonin (produces intense feelings of wellbeing)\n\nDopamine (intensifies motivation)\n\nOxytocin (increases a sense of connection to others)\n\nThe “feel good” outcome of this combination naturally makes us want to repeat it. But when our need to help becomes so insatiable that our sense of purpose is tied directly to others, specifically, them needing our guidance, it is no longer other people that we are helping. It is ourselves.\n\nPsychologists refer to this particular problem as agency addiction, or The White Knight Syndrome. It is defined as a need to rescue others through helping — with our advice, coaching, or ideas — in order to bolster our feelings of self-importance. Whereas those with a healthy sense of agency are just as gratified by helping others succeed as they are seeing them succeed on their own.\n\nThis phenomenon could perhaps be a consequence of working in a knowledge economy. This kind of ever-changing, highly innovative environment can intensify our need to feel useful. For many employees today, contribution is measured in adopted ideas, insightful analyses, or answers to hard questions. What we produce is inseparably tied to who we are. At one firm I consulted with, this was true to a precarious extent. A partner at the firm was so bright, generous, and willing to help anyone that his colleagues referred to him as “the answer ATM.” His motto was, “You’re only as good as your last idea.” Privately, however, he suffered with depression and anxiety, unable to separate his sense of value from the help he offered those around him.\n\nIf you have ever wondered whether your genuine enjoyment of helping others teeters on over-indulgence, there a few things you can to do overcome agency addiction, or avoid it altogether.\n\nMonitor your internal narratives.\n\nThe best way to test whether or not you have an inclination to over-help is to turn inward and take a hard look at your own mind. Ask yourself these questions and answer them honestly:\n\nWhen I’m not helping others, do I feel anxious or aimless? Do I offer others unsolicited advice, even in casual social settings, under the guise of “just trying to be helpful?” Do I feel defensive or dismissive when I learn that the people I helped have found another’s advice helpful, or that they didn’t consult me on a problem? Do I imagine helping others with life-changing advice, visualizing how my help could be vital to their success? Do I feel insecure when someone I help questions or doesn’t take my advice? Do I fish for praise after giving advice, or need the other person to acknowledge that I was helpful? Do I feel taken advantage of, like I’ve made a sacrifice, after a stressful period of helping?\n\nAnswering yes to a few of the above doesn’t necessarily confirm you over-help, but it could indicate that it is something you should watch out for. If you answered yes to all of the above, or feel concerned about this topic, you may need to consider doing some deeper work to identify where and how you might have fused your sense of identity with giving others help in the first place.\n\nCommit to being an equal partner, and not a savior.\n\nThe greatest helpers set clear expectations from the outset. One of the first boundaries I set with clients is, “I will never care about your success more than you do.” A telling sign of over-helping is when you find yourself doing more to help others than they do for themselves. If a coach or leader routinely reminds clients or direct-reports of commitments they’ve made, accepts excuses when those commitments are missed, and even steps in to do some of the work for them, then the partnership is not equal. And if that coach or leader finds the superlative expressions of gratitude privately satiating (“I can’t thank you enough — you really saved me!”), their inner white knight has been activated. To be a great helper, you must be willing to let those you help suffer the consequences of their own choices when they fall short. Adhering to clear, mutual accountabilities makes success a shared outcome.\n\nAvoid dependency by measuring improvement.\n\nThe consulting and coaching professions have been appropriately criticized for having economic models that incent extending revenue streams after clients no longer need them. Similarly, leaders often feel insecure about the talents of those they lead surpassing them. But the fundamental reason behind any coaching relationship is to help the other person realize improvement. The greatness of a coach can be measured by their ability to help someone grow to a point of no longer needing them. Similarly, the greatness of a leader can be measured by their willingness to let others outshine them. Cultivating dependency only makes the other person weaker, even if it temporarily makes you feel powerful.\n\nTo avoid this, helpers should measure progress against defined objectives for improvement. For example, if a coach is working with a leader to improve their ability to delegate, they should track progress on delegation opportunities to ensure they don’t rehash old ground. While it’s reasonable for new needs or opportunities for help to arise, continuing to be “needed” for the same issue for too long is a clear sign that the lack of progress has become what is gratifying to both the helper and the one being helped (it’s often safer to stay helpless and keep relying on the helper to be rescued).\n\nApply the right amount of pressure.\n\nOne of the common complaints leaders share with me is, “My coach didn’t really push me that hard. We just talked during our sessions, but I didn’t feel challenged.” Many in advisory professions fear putting their relationships at risk by being “too honest” about issues that must be addressed. Likewise, many leaders avoid giving hard feedback to dodge conflict. I’ve heard coaches and consultants justify pulling their punches with statements like, “I’m not sure they’re ready to hear that.” I’ve heard leaders avoid addressing underperformance with, “Let’s give them one more quarter to turn this around.” While it’s prudent to thoughtfully prepare leaders to hear tough news, it’s equally important to be honest about whose interest you are serving by delaying it. A coach or consultant’s greatest value to a client is their ability to see and offer the unvarnished truth, no matter how difficult it is to hear. Followers trust leaders that deliver hard messages in respectful, caring ways.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, I’ve seen bullying coaches and leaders whose bluntness borders on abusive, leading to the loss of confidence and commitment on the part of those being helped. They speak in condescending dogma and bark declarations. Both avoidant and bully helpers reach the same outcome — keeping those they help in need of them. To become great, leaders and coaches must learn to determine the right degree of pressure to apply — it should be enough to sustain confidence and commitment while making tangible progress.\n\nContributing to others’ success is a sacrosanct privilege. “First, do no harm” applies as much to us as it does to physicians. It’s a wonderful feeling to know others rely on our help. But when our desire for impact contorts into a need to be indispensable and pivotal to others’ achievement, we’ve started our decent to the very insignificance we fear. Because when those we help figure out we are serving our egos instead of them, they back away. In a world where who we are and what we do have become so closely connected, it’s especially critical for helpers to keep a healthy separation between them. Great help is what you give, it’s not who you are."

            "content": "Getty\n\nEnterprising leaders who tackle big problems like world hunger can learn from Alexis Mejía and Kurt Schneider, two pioneers inspired by the same vision to reduce postharvest loss with metal silos in Honduras.\n\nBuilding the airtight cylinders started as a part-time business for Mejía. During the planting and harvest seasons in Nacaome, a rural town near the Pacific coast of Honduras, he managed a family farm. But as demand grew for the grain storage units, his small workshop expanded.\n\nBy 2008, he had six employees. “Nowadays, this activity is the sole source of income for my wife, seven children and me, and we are doing quite well,” Mejía says.\n\nThe success story is one of thousands across Central America since the 1980s, when local tinsmiths began manufacturing and selling the silos to protect crops from insects, rodents and fungi. Developed markets already had the technology, but it was revolutionary in Nacaome and surrounding communities.\n\nSmallholder farmers no longer had to rush to sell their corn and beans after harvest, when heavy supply drove prices down. Perhaps more importantly, they no longer had to buy back their own produce to eat later in the year when prices were high. Skeptical customers quickly saw the value. They could wait and go to market on their own terms, while storing enough grain at home to last an entire year.\n\nMarket growth hinges on entrepreneurs like Mejía, but lack of infrastructure in places like rural Honduras can stifle enterprise. To truly make technology stick in difficult terrain, entrepreneurs need help from innovators like Schneider, a project leader with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.\n\nHe arrived in Honduras years before Mejía built his first silo. Unlike some aid agency directors, who show up in marginalized communities with ready-made answers, Schneider started by asking questions. He understood that the ultimate decision-makers had to be local farmers ready for change.\n\nMy research with Sonali K. Shah and Steven T. Sonka at the University of Illinois confirms the need for a bottom up approach when developing industries in developing economies. Viable ecosystems do not happen on their own. You can’t just set a clock and wait. But at the same time, omniscient planners cannot swoop in with prescribed solutions.\n\nPrior to Schneider’s arrival, multiple efforts at introducing storage technologies and government regulation had failed. Farmers had little trust in nonprofit or state-sponsored interventions. Instead, Schneider adopted a market economy mindset, which requires a process of experimentation and testing.\n\nFor independent entrepreneurs like Mejía to pursue metal silos as a profitable venture, Schneider had to lay the groundwork for coordination of all parties involved, including metal-smiths, material suppliers, trainers, credit institutions and NGOs. Only then could he be assured that the social intervention would scale up, adapt and survive long-term.\n\nMy more recent research with Shah and Mahka Moeen at the University of North Carolina provides a framework for understanding how people with different aspirations and abilities can come together to resolve uncertainty in a new industry and create robust markets. The knowledge discovery process happens in three stages, each culminating with a measurable milestone.\n\nCommercialization\n\nThe first stage is incubation, the period between a technological breakthrough or identification of unmet need and the first instance of commercialization. Among multiple available technologies that could address post-harvest loss, Swiss aid workers in Honduras needed more than 10 years just to pinpoint metal silos as a potential solution and design a business model that could work in isolated communities cut off from global supply chains.\n\nThe discovery process, which started in 1974 at a United Nations nutrition conference, moved from one challenge to the next. Who would build the silos? Where would they get their raw materials and tools? Who would finance them? Who would train them? Where would they find their first customers?\n\nProgress was so slow in the beginning that Schneider almost lost support. “The success of the project was not certain right at the beginning,” he writes. “The continuation of the project was seriously questioned as more concrete results for the target population were desired.”\n\nFirm Takeoff\n\nOnce a product is deemed commercially viable, a monopoly stage ensues with few competitors. This period ends when multiple entrepreneurs see enough of a potential to enter the market, resulting in a sharp takeoff in the number of firms in operation.\n\nIn Honduras these entrepreneurs came from the user community. Schneider engaged with farmers like Mejía by providing them demonstrations, training and support during this stage. As the second milestone approached, Swiss aid workers gradually withdrew their involvement as part of a planned exit strategy.\n\nSales Takeoff\n\nThe final stage culminates with a sharp rise in sales, signaling a transition to commercial sustainability. The milestone is achieved when a robust supply chain meets up with assured demand.\n\nSchneider fostered alliances by helping all parties involved create business models that would work for them. Rather than things falling apart, the win-win relationships in the markets for metal silos created a surge of innovation soon after the aid ended. With relatively little support, local manufacturers continued to produce and sell metal silos directly to farmers.\n\nBy the time the aid ended in 2003, the program had produced almost 900 metal silo manufacturers, spreading from Honduras to other countries in Central America. The expansion reached Guatemala in 1990, Nicaragua in 1992 and El Salvador in 1994—20 years after the UN summit. Since then, the technology has continued to spread to 16 developing countries on three continents.\n\nBusiness and nonprofit leaders often see each other as rivals in developing markets. But as the collaboration in Central America shows, Mejía and Schneider complemented each other in critical ways.\n\nMarkets don’t just emerge. But when the right individuals pull together in the right ways, they make the world a better place by harnessing the power of enterprise."

            "content": "Good News: USA Had Largest CO2 Reduction In The World In 2019\n\nThere is a bit of good news to share that might have slipped under your nose. The USA had the largest CO2 reduction in the world in 2019 on a country basis (as you can see above, as an entire economic bloc, the EU had a greater CO2 reduction). This news comes from data gathered by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nGlobal energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were down in 2019 by around 33 gigatonnes after two years of increases. The IEA says that this came from a sharp decline in CO2 emissions from the power sector in advanced economies and credits the role of renewable sources (wind and solar). It also adds that choosing natural gas over coal has been a big help. (Editor’s note: There’s a lot of controversy about accounting on this topic, specifically related to methane emissions throughout the natural gas lifecycle.)\n\nInternational Energy Agency: \"The United States saw the largest decline in energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019 on a country basis…US emissions are now down almost 1 Gt from their peak in the year 2000, the largest absolute decline by any country\" https://t.co/LpfXYfGCf2 — Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) February 12, 2020\n\nGlobal CO2 emissions from the use of coal declined by almost 200 million tonnes, or 1.3%, from 2018’s levels, which offset increases in emissions from oil and natural gas. US emissions are down almost one gigatonne from their peak in 2000.\n\nThe European Union, including the UK, showed a drop by 160 megatonnes. This was driven mostly by the power sector and switching from coal to gas.\n\nGermany led the decline in emissions in Europe, which saw its emissions fall to a level that hasn’t been seen since the 1950s: 620 megatonnes. It should be noted that the last time Germany saw such a low amount of carbon emissions its economy was 10 times smaller than it is now.\n\nJapan also saw its energy-related CO2 emissions fall 4.3%, its fastest pace of decline since 2009.\n\nThis is extremely good news, but we as a global people still have our work cut out for us. We should definitely take a moment to celebrate, but we have to keep working towards reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that is being put into our atmosphere. The fact that the US is leading CO2 reduction globally just shows that what we are doing is working — slowly, but it is working. Though, we all need to implement reductions faster.\n\n"

(photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images) In Pictures via Getty Images\n\nThere should be no question by now that carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming and that more aggressive policy is needed to do more to rein in emissions. The importance of mitigation and adaptation policies means that in weighing our options it is important that policymakers have the most accurate data and models at their disposal. As our knowledge evolves so too must our understandings. As economist John Maynard Keynes quipped: “When the facts change, I change my mind.”\n\nIn a recent commentary in Nature, Zeke Hausfather of The Breakthrough Institute and Glen Peters of the CICERO Center for International Climate Research argued that a heavily emphasized, extreme scenario in climate research has diverged from the real-world, and is thus not an appropriate baseline on which to center climate research and assessment.\n\nIn a paper just posted to SocArXiv we complement the Hausfather and Peters analysis by comprehensively comparing the scenarios of the Fifth (AR5) and Sixth (AR6) assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to observations of the real world for the period 2005 (when most scenarios initiate) to 2017 (the most recent year for most data).\n\nA rigorous evaluation of scenarios matters because climate change poses significant risks, and effective mitigation and adaptation policy making depends upon robust and accurate scientific information. Such information – on physical science, societal and ecological impacts, and on economics and policy — contributes to the development of policy alternatives and to securing their legitimacy in public and political debates.\n\nSpecifically, in our new paper we decompose scenarios into the primary drivers of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion (FF). These four drivers are population, per capita GDP, the energy intensity of the economy and the carbon intensity of energy consumption. Together, these four factors comprise the so-called Kaya identity, named after the Japanese scientist Yoichi Kaya who proposed it in the 1980s as the basis for projecting future carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nWe find that most of the scenarios of the IPCC – and not just the most extreme baseline highlighted by Hausfather and Peters – over-projected global carbon dioxide emissions (from FF). Specifically, real-world observations of carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2017 grew at a slower rate than 83% of AR5 (Working Group 3 baseline) scenarios and 73% of AR6 (SSP baseline) scenarios. This can be seen in the figure below.\n\nComparison of energy-related CO2 emissions projected by energy outlooks and by IPCC AR5 and ... [+] high-emission SSP (SSP5-8.5, SSP3-7.0) baseline scenarios. Burgess et al. 2020\n\nThe divergence between the real-world observations of carbon dioxide emissions and the baseline scenarios of the IPCC is expected to widen over the next several decades. According to projections of major energy outlooks, by 2040 carbon dioxide emissions (from FF) may fall below the entire range of IPCC AR5 and AR6 baseline scenarios, even assuming that no new major climate policy efforts are undertaken between now and then.\n\nThere is both good news and bad news to be found in our decomposition of the reasons behind the divergence between the real-world and the scenarios.\n\nThe good news is obvious: carbon dioxide emissions are not growing as fast as was expected across most models and across all regions of the world. One important reason for this is that the world’s energy consumption is becoming less carbon intensive, meaning that our energy supply is becoming cleaner faster than was expected. Scholars will no doubt debate what role enacted climate policies may have played in this trend, but it is clear that a large part of the trend is due to factors beyond climate policy alone, such as the boom in natural gas from fracking and corresponding decreasing competitiveness of coal.\n\nThe challenge of dramatically decarbonizing the global economy remains huge, but the fact that emissions are not increasing as fast as expected should be received as welcome good news.\n\nThe bad news is that many of the scenarios of the IPCC have over-projected global per-capita GDP growth, across all regions of the world. Economic growth confers many benefits, and is a stated goal of politicians across the world. With respect to climate policy, if economic activity is not advancing as fast as anticipated, it could create potential headwinds for more aggressive climate policies.\n\nWhile economists disagree about the potential for global growth to 2100, it seems unlikely that in the coming decades the world can “catch-up” to projected growth rates of AR5 and AR6 baseline scenarios, since that would require rates of growth from 2020 to 2040 much higher than assumed in most scenarios. In the real world, projections of the IMF and the possible impact of the coronavirus on near-term GDP growth rates suggests that slower than projected per capita GDP growth is set to persist in the coming years.\n\nIf so, then this would mean that global carbon dioxide emissions (from FF) will continue to diverge from baseline scenarios of the IPCC. To the extent that GDP growth rates may be over-projected in leading energy assessments, this would mean even lower carbon dioxide emissions than found in their projections.\n\nWhy does our analysis matter?\n\nIf the scenarios of the IPCC offer, in effect, road maps that help us to shape our possible pathways into the future, then we are at risk of proceeding with out-of-date information. Flawed maps can lead to unexpected dead ends and challenges in reaching desired destinations.\n\nIn climate research, everything from projection of near-term (to mid-century) climate impacts to cost-benefit analysis of the near-term costs and benefit of mitigation will be impacted adversely by utilizing overly aggressive projections of carbon dioxide emissions. Similarly, work that depends upon projections of population, per capita GDP, energy intensity and carbon intensity will be impacted by models that no longer correspond with the real world.\n\nSuch impacts will grow increasingly significant as the real-world diverges from corresponding characterizations of the real-world found in models. As we conclude, “scenarios are drifting away from policy relevance.” Ultimately, there is no good reason why climate science and policy should continue to rely on models that are now out-of-date with respect to the evolution of the real world. Climate science and policy are far too important not to update scenarios and provide policy makers with more accurate maps to help guide how we travel into the future.\n\nBurgess, M.

I do not purport to know the answers to these questions. However, I do know what is real, true and impactful when I see it.\n\nTake, for instance, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and how she makes choices to be compassionate and kind no matter the circumstances around her. She was photographed hugging a Muslim woman outside the mosque where horrific attacks took place on March 17, 2019. To me, with just one look at this picture, you can quickly discern that this is one leader who recognizes she matters in bringing about real change in her country by being purposeful when it comes to inclusion, acceptance and togetherness. One could say she is living her purpose, and, by extension, so is her country.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, each one of us has a purpose, and the function of one's life is to attain that purpose. This sentiment of bringing to life our purpose is also echoed by Marcus Aurelius in Meditations. He felt it was our duty to carry out the purpose we were created for. In fact, he wrote: \"Everything, a horse, a vine, is created for some duty. For what task, then, were you yourself created? A man's [or a woman's] true delight is to do the things he [or she] was made for.\"\n\nAnd, in our modern times, we have the CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, whose letter to CEOs went viral: \"a company cannot achieve long-term profits without embracing purpose and considering the needs of a broad range of stakeholders.\"\n\nOur sense of purpose, try as we may, cannot be divorced from our work. Over the course of our lives, we will spend approximately 90,000 hours at work. Our self-identity is intricately linked to our job and the connection we develop with our daily tasks and interactions. In fact, our organizational commitment is experienced as a psychological attachment, and based on the strength of this attachment, we are likely to internalize and adopt characteristics of the organization.\n\nIn my own research, I have found that employees who perceived a fit between their work and personal values were significantly less likely to leave their organization. In a global survey of 474 executives conducted by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, 89% felt that a strong sense of collective purpose influences employee satisfaction, 84% linked it to their organization's ability to transform and 80% stated that it actually helped to increase customer loyalty.\n\nThe finding that \"working with a sense of purpose boosts employee motivation, productivity, morale, and overall job satisfaction\" has also been reported in other studies (registration required). Interesting to note is research spanning over 10 years by John Kotter and James Heskett. These professors found that companies driven by purpose outperformed their counterparts in stock price by a factor of twelve! Indeed, the number of companies that have embedded their purpose within their business strategy is growing.\n\nWe are emotionally and cognitively designed to connect and align with our company's purpose. Companies that realize this are more inclined to work toward creating a purpose-driven organization, and, in turn, are more likely to experience a greater return on their investments across the board.\n\nInternational management consultant Michael Ben-Eli writes that transforming society and the world's economy to a sustainable basis presents our most significant challenge ever. He says the challenge is unprecedented — a thing never before seen. Its context: the planet. Its actors: us. \"Our planet is exquisitely configured to accommodate life abundantly,\" he says. \"We have consistently compromised, however, every vital component of its intricate fabric. This trend must be reversed and a lasting balance restored.\" And because we are, after all, human, he points out that this calls for a fundamental shift in our consciousness at the same time as our actions.\n\nLife and consciousness are the bottom line in understanding a larger universe. We are the biological creature that fashions what we make as our purpose. So the first order of business is to change how we come together to be profitable such that our people and the larger context both benefit.\n\nIn closing, I believe the founder of Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, summarizes what we should all be doing. He advised his HR department to do the following: \"Whenever we have a job opening, all things being equal, hire the person who's committed to saving the planet no matter what the job is.\" In my view, he is in the business of hiring the right mindset, as he has discovered that employees' mindset is the hardest aspect of any business to influence in the quest to save the planet. We should all be so lucky to realize this."

            "content": "My name is Tom Bird, and I am the Lead Developer on post-launch Age of Wonders: Planetfall. Planetfall was an amazing game to work on — it gave us the opportunity to explore lots of cool sci-fi ideas and give our own twists to them, and build a new universe for people to explore. However, as great as we felt the game was, there is always room for improvement, and several months ago we began the process of building a major update, incorporating the feedback that we had gotten from players.\n\nOne of the main requests was more content for the middle period of the game. Early on there were lots of interesting structures for the player to explore, but once the player began deploying more powerful armies, these sites stopped being a challenge. There were large landmarks which needed powerful armies to conquer, but these are very rare, and players were missing something to sit in the middle ground between these and the early game structures.\n\nIn order to figure out the first step I sat down with Thomas Schuiten, the designer who leads creation of structures and tactical combat maps (he also wrote a lot of the anomalous site stories from the Awakenings DLC). We decided that one particular class of world map structure was undervalued in the current build: Visit Sites.\n\nDNA Vault visit site from the Pre-Tyrannosaurus version of the game\n\nThe DNA vault above grants a temporary bonus to armies visiting it (hence the name Visit Site), yet due to the mechanics of how armies move around, it’s often ignored since it’s not worth the time of an army to detour that structure. He proposed that we could use these structures as a starting point to develop a new class of structures that could provide the right level of challenge that players were missing. The following week he delivered a document proposing a design:\n\nThis screenshot is part of the original design doc; the old sites are on the left and the redesigns are on the right\n\nThe design massively boosted the economic value of some sites, and also gave them a stat boost that could be applied to units that were built in the Colony that contained the site. The “visit” effect would be removed, so that the site’s description would not be cluttered. The basic idea was that the sites would be highly desirable structures that we could distribute through the world, with powerful defenders that would require advanced armies to clear, plugging the gap in the game flow.\n\nIt was decided to keep two of the visit sites around, the Charge Station since more move points was always a useful thing for players, and the Repair Station since healing units was also useful. The most popular visit site (the Heavy Weapons Factory) gave a powerful damage bonus to visiting armies, so we decided to merge that into the Repair Station as well, upping its potential value.\n\nSince the design had passed the first hurdle it was time to bring Sara Obert on board. Sara is the artist in charge of making the environment art for Planetfall’s DLC, and she and Thomas had already worked together to make the combat maps for the Awakening’s DLC. Sara’s job would be to dress the combat maps for each site, so that players who entered them would be really sold on the story of each site.\n\nThe first stage is to use existing in-game assets to make a block-out of each map. This can then be used to test the layout to make sure it works for gameplay purposes.\n\nThe DNA vault block-out. The Vault Walls were reused from previous interior maps, where they represented computer banks covered in blinking lights\n\nThe block-out was used to test:\n\nIs there enough space to move around — if gaps are too narrow then melee units will have difficulty reaching their targets\n\nDoes the AI behave appropriately, not blocking itself and utilizing flanks intended in the layout\n\nAre there good sight lines and cover positions for ranged combat, particularly at the ‘meeting point’ (the area where the fight would occur in an Automatic Resolution)\n\nCan we make a layout that sells the story of the map\n\nOnce the block-out was completed, Sara and Thomas worked together to try and make the map more “visually logical.” For example, staircases were moved so they were in positions that stairs would be needed in a real structure, rather than simply where it was good for combat.\n\nFinally, Sara could get to work “dressing the map.” This process is similar to building a house in The Sims. Sara has a huge library of assets that she and others have made which she can use to make the map beautiful and tell the story of an ancient vault, filled with the genetic secrets of the old Star Union.\n\n\n\nThe completed vault map. Lighting and particle effects are also very important to get the right atmosphere for the map\n\nThe final step is deciding on the composition of the defenders — since this is a site about genetic research, the Xenoplague army set was chosen as being the best fit!\n\nAnd a view of the new DNA vault on the world map\n\nOf course, this is just one Exploration site. This process was repeated for another six sites, bringing a total of seven new exploration structures to the update! This includes an Imperial War Monument which grants units a permanent morale bonus, and a Terraforming Station that grants resistance to status effects.\n\n\n\nAmazon Warriors move to take a terraforming station from its Promethean guardians\n\nAs well as these new structures, the Tyrannosaurus update contains a large number of other improvements. The economy has been streamlined, reducing micromanagement so players can focus on the big choices that really matter. The interfaces have been cleared up, with a major pass on the overview maps to help players plan out their economic growth. We’ve also added new game modes, such as the much requested No Colonizer Mode, and a new Relaxed mode for players who want a more chilled out experience.\n\nAlong with a huge host of balance changes, bug fixes and small quality-of-life tweaks, the Tyrannosaurus Update is the biggest update to the game we’ve made by far. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!"

            "content": "Getty\n\nToday, understanding the cost of auto insurance can feel a bit like solving the da Vinci code.\n\nMost drivers understand that there are variables that determine the price of their premiums but don’t understand which factors outweigh others when it comes to lowering costs or saving money. Understandably, a lack of transparency around this process leaves drivers feeling angry and powerless to reduce auto insurance costs, despite safe driving.\n\nOn the other side, faced with lagging revenues and steadily rising losses, many insurers also feel this pain. To provide a better customer experience that can save drivers money and limit their own exposure, many are turning to usage-based (UBI) models to more accurately predict costs. These models seek to reduce reliance on generic personal information like age or gender and replace it with concrete, real-world data. They use tools such as onboard diagnostics (OBDII)—which are equipped in today’s vehicles to monitor dangerous behaviors like rapid acceleration, excessive speeding and hard braking—in conjunction with more traditional information such as mileage to more accurately calculate risk.\n\nHowever, now several years into these efforts, it’s far from “the prince who was promised” to save the auto insurance industry. In fact, these models come with a brand-new set of financial pitfalls for providers as average premiums have continued to rise year over year since 2013. Why is that?\n\nFor what it gets right, usage-based models still have one glaring blind spot that keeps them from accurately measuring risk: distracted driving. This is because onboard diagnostics only track what the vehicle is doing, not what the actual driver is doing. This is part of the reason I founded a driving analytics company: to make roads safer by keeping people off their phones. Fortunately for consumers and insurers, there’s a solution that is now able to measure both vehicle usage and driver behavior. It’s known as behavior-based insurance, and it promises to change the calculus in favor of drivers and their insurers alike.\n\nWhy Does The Cost of Auto Insurance Increase Every Year?\n\nAs many know, insurance providers use a standard set of variables to determine the cost of insurance, such as age, gender (now illegal in some states), location, vehicle type, credit score and driving record. However, many of these variables are simply substitutions for actual risk measurement, designed only to estimate a driver’s risk based on rough demographic assumptions about drivers vaguely similar to them.\n\nInsurance premiums have gone up by a whopping 23% since 2011. That’s not chump change. There are several reasons car insurance costs continue to increase. Right now, the economy is doing well. High employment rates and cheap gas prices have people spending more time on the road, where they can be involved in crashes. Modern vehicles today contain more expensive technology such as sensors and computers, so when they are involved in accidents, it can be far more expensive to fix, diagnose or replace these parts, increasing claims cost.\n\nNext, insurance fraud is rampant. There are a few ways that fraud increases costs overall, and it mainly boils down to driving behavior. When someone lies on their application about how often or how far they drive, insurance underwriters can’t tell if they’re taking on a good or bad risk. So, all drivers pay a bit more to account for the bad apples. Insurers are also dependent on customers to report claims, so if the customer waits weeks or months to report or lies about the circumstances of the crash, costs could be higher.\n\nInsurers report that detecting fraud before claims are paid and improving fraud-detecting analytics are two of their top strategic cost-saving priorities.\n\nFinally, modern-day technology is growing more distracting, and distracted driving has become an epidemic. As our devices get smarter, larger and even more useful with upcoming 5G networks, they will continue to offer more features that distract us from the road. A study our company conducted found that driver phone use is 100 times worse than previous estimates. And according to the NHTSA, distracted driving caused 3,166 deaths in 2017 alone.\n\nUnfortunately for consumers, most of these reasons are outside of their ability to control and mitigate, except for one: Distracted driving is a dangerous behavior that drivers have the power to eliminate. With the right tools and a new insurance model, insurers can leverage that fact to offer truly safe drivers the low rates they deserve.\n\nA Smarter Way Forward\n\nUsage-based insurance models cannot account for distracted driving. With behavior-based insurance, drivers and insurers can better understand actual behaviors on the road using new technologies such as AI, coupled with the most common “on-board device” in America: our smartphones.\n\nSmartphones have made distracted driving more common, but where technology created the problem, it can also be the cure. Smartphone sensors are being used to detect or prevent device usage while driving. Onboard driver-assistance features such as automatic emergency braking or lane-keeping assistance can also make drivers safer.\n\nThere are other ways, too, such as apps like Waze that direct traffic away from congested roads or camera systems that identify when distracted or tired driving occurs. Even wireless carriers and developers are pushing services to quell the epidemic of distracted driving, such as features that lock your mobile device when the car reaches a designated speed. These tools, and the information we acquire from them, can lead to huge savings for both drivers and insurers.\n\nWith real-world data from millions of devices, insurers can take better stock of risks, and drivers can track their own driving habits to reduce costs and improve safety for everyone out on the roads. Behavior-based insurance grows smarter and more accurate every month as it gathers more real-world data and runs on ever-improving technology. The future of auto insurance promises to be fairer and more affordable, and to actually reward safer driving."

            "content": "Mumbai: India’s slowing economy took a toll on much-needed savings too, with the savings rate touching a 15-year low, and household savings also falling. This has weakened India’s macro-economic position which is already hobbled by low investment and rising external borrowing to fund capital needs.Household savings also declined as consumers spent more in purchasing durables and travelling. Indian households contribute to about 60 per cent of the country’s savings. But India remains favourable compared to emerging market peers such as Brazil.“If the country wants high sustainable growth, it must raise the investment rate. But investment needs funding,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. “If domestic savings are falling, the government is right to tap into foreign savings.”India’s gross savings fell to 30.1 per cent of the gross domestic product in fiscal 2019 from 34.6 per cent in fiscal 2012, and 36 per cent in 2007-08, data from the Central Statistical Organisation shows. The previous low was 29 per cent in 2003-2004. As a per cent of GDP, household savings fell from 23 per cent in 2012, to 18 per cent last year.A falling savings rate could lead to Indian companies ending up borrowing more from overseas markets, weakening India’s external position as it would raise the nation’s external debt.“In order to raise investments at a time when savings are falling, the current account balance will have to fall or the current account deficit will have to widen, needing more foreign inflows for funding,” Bhandari said.India’s external borrowing last fiscal rose to $543 billion, from $475 billion in 2015, data from RBI shows.Economists also attribute the current slowdown in the economy partly to the fall in the savings rate.“We estimate India’s long-term growth to have slowed to 6.5 per cent vs 7.1 per cent estimated three years ago, partly due to this macro imbalance created — falling savings and muted investments,” UBS Securities said in a report.When compared to BRICS economies and other emerging market peers, India stands out favourably. Brazil has a savings rate of 16 per cent of GDP, Mexico 23 per cent, and the Philippines 14.2 per cent. But bigger rival China is at 46 per cent, data with the World Bank shows."

            "content": "Reuters\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak's effect on the world economy is driving growth near negative levels in the first quarter of 2020, UBS economists wrote on Tuesday.\n\nThe hit to China's economy accounts for most of the bank's updated forecast, with disruptions in Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong also weighing on global expansion.\n\nUBS's guidance doesn't take supply-chain slowdowns into account, and Apple recently warned that a hit to iPhone production would drive quarterly revenue below its initial estimate.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe fallout from the coronavirus outbreak is already showing up in companies' guidance and market reactions. Now UBS economists expect the epidemic to drag global growth near negative levels in the first quarter.\n\nBefore the outbreak, the bank's \"global now-cast\" metric showed growth surging throughout Asia. But its latest reading projected a global growth increase of just 0.5% during the first three months of the year, down from the 3.5% level expected earlier in the quarter.\n\nThe virus' hit to China's economy accounts for most of UBS's lowered guidance, with disruptions in Hong Kong, Thailand, and Singapore also dragging the metric lower. Any growth level below zero reflects a contraction in the global economy, and consecutive quarters of contraction mark a global recession.\n\nUBS's global growth forecast doesn't take supply-chain slowdowns into account, said a team led by Arend Kapteyn. Apple is among the latest firms to update their guidance on the virus' hit to manufacturing. The iPhone maker said on Tuesday that revenue for the quarter ending in March would fall below its initial estimate, citing a temporary hit to global phone supply. Apple shares fell as much as 3.2% on the news.\n\nRead more: A Wall Street firm lists its 5 best hedges for an unusual coronavirus-driven market crash — and shares what to do if it's successfully contained\n\nUBS said it expected central banks to stay in a \"wait-and-see mode,\" holding off on any stimulus as economic data reflecting the outbreak's fallout trickles in. The Federal Reserve is likely to hold its benchmark interest rate steady until inflation rises to its 2% goal. The European Central Bank \"is largely on autopilot\" while it focuses on a strategy review, the team wrote. Even Japan's central bank is expected to stay patient even though the nation saw a virus-related death on February 8, UBS said.\n\nThough the bank's latest guidance reflects an ominous outlook for the world economy, containment of the virus would drive a sharp recovery. Delayed consumption and investment, along with economic stimulus, \"should lead growth to snap back sharply ... similar to what one would see after a natural disaster,\" the team wrote on Tuesday. The net effect on annual growth is a less worrisome 0.2-percentage-point reduction, they added.\n\nThe death toll in the outbreak reached 1,875 people on Tuesday, with more than 73,000 people infected. Most of the infections are in China, though cases have been reported in at least 26 countries. Only five deaths have been reported outside mainland China, with single fatalities in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, and France.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nHSBC tanks the most since 2017 after announcing a $7.2 billion overhaul charge\n\nApple sees $45 billion in market value wiped out after warning that the coronavirus will push revenue below forecasts\n\nSalesforce was just named one of the best companies to work for in 2020.

            "content": "Imagine, for a moment, that the robots have won.\n\nThe year is 2049—the same year researchers once pegged as the one in which A.I. would become smart enough to pen a bestselling book more adeptly than a human author could. Technological advancements have upended the transportation, manufacturing and retail sectors, rendering nearly half of the U.S. jobs that existed in the year 2020 obsolete.\n\n\n\nYou’ve just had a surgery—a relatively minor, outpatient procedure performed by a surgical robot—and now you’re on your way to the pharmacy to fill a prescription for the pain. The car that transports you there is driverless, as are all the other vehicles on the road. At the drugstore, a mechanical arm sifts through rows of pharmaceuticals before meting out and packing up the correct dosage of pills for you. After a few minutes spent scanning the magazine rack in the pharmacy’s automated checkout line, you settle at the last minute on a trashy tabloid; some of the articles inside of it are the handiwork of particularly sophisticated A.I.\n\nIn this automated world, there are fewer jobs available. To be clear, experts aren’t totally convinced that the coming robot revolution will render all jobs outmoded at any point in the future, near or far. But imagining a post-work society is a useful gateway into thinking about how to preserve dignity and stay afloat in the capitalist soup that unfettered neoliberalism has made in the 21st century, and how to address yawning inequality and wage stagnation as an increasingly automated future takes root.\n\nOne hypothetical solution to both problems is universal basic income, or UBI. At its most essential, a UBI is a guaranteed cash transfer that a government disseminates directly to people, regardless of how much or how little money they make. Its proponents argue that its dual gifts are dignity and security: By having the cash in-hand without the paternalistic meddling of the welfare state, UBI recipients have the freedom to choose how to invest in their own futures. And by establishing a nationwide income floor, a UBI could simultaneously help to ensure that workers are at least somewhat protected from the privatization and technological obsolescence that threaten to destabilize entire industries.\n\nAlthough former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang helped push the program into the mainstream by championing the idea of a $1,000 monthly “Freedom Dividend” as a central plank in his 2020 campaign, the concept of UBI has existed for centuries, stretching as far back as the 16th century, when English philosopher Thomas More slipped a casual reference to a guaranteed minimum income into his socio-political satire Utopia. Various iterations of the concept have been tested all around the world, from Kenya to India to the Netherlands to Alaska, and it is currently the subject of a pilot program in Stockton, California.\n\nNatalie Foster, a co-chair and co-founder of the Economic Security Project—“a network that supports the exploration and experimentation of a guaranteed income”—says that capitalism’s single-minded emphasis on profit and profitability has so warped our ideas about purpose and usefulness in work, that some of the most valuable roles in our social contract sometimes go unpaid and undervalued.\n\nCapitalism’s single-minded emphasis on profit has so warped our ideas about purpose and usefulness in work, that some of the most valuable roles in our social contract sometimes go unpaid and undervalued.\n\n“We [as a country] say if you're taking care of a family member who is disabled and you stay at home with them, that's not work. And that makes no sense,” Foster said. “We need to broaden our understanding of work, and I think a guaranteed income gets us closer to that.”\n\nBut debates about what constitutes work aren’t purely semantic. The gulf between America’s richest and poorest citizens is currently the widest it’s been since the Census Bureau first began recording wealth data more than 50 years ago, and as many as 40 percent of Americans say they would be unable to cover an emergency $400 medical expense, should the situation arise. A UBI, Foster said, is “one of the ways you can start to rebalance the economy by putting money back in people’s pockets”—and a way to infuse a sense of pride back into an American workforce that has been stripped stripped of its dignity over the years.\n\n“That’s the power of a guaranteed income: saying that no matter who you are and what you do, every month, you know you have income that can help you pay the rent, pay bills, take care of childcare, deal with a vehicle expense, and allow you to take more risks with work or to leave a job you don’t love, or more importantly to stop the second or third job that you have to do in order to put food on the table,” Foster said.\n\nA UBI, it’s worth noting, wouldn’t eliminate the need for work entirely; after all, $1,000 a month, as some have proposed—already considered in some quarters to be a nearly cost-prohibitive price tag for a universally applied program—is hardly enough money to get by in most American cities. But the program would necessitate a radical philosophical shift in the ways that we think about work, and the role that self-esteem plays in our labor.\n\nWith guaranteed income, workers could turn down a job that they didn’t want to do, or to forgo a second or third job in favor of spending more time with family.\n\nIt would, for example, imbue workers with enough economic security to turn down a job that they didn’t want to do, or to forgo a second or third job in favor of spending more time with family and loved ones. Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), has in the past referred to UBI as a national strike fund—one that effectively creates bargaining power for striking workers by ensuring that they wouldn’t have to cross a picket line in order to be able to afford their cost of living.\n\nBut while a UBI wouldn’t do away with the need for work entirely, experts say that’s not much of an issue to begin with: People want to work, in part because they derive so much of their social value from it.\n\nIoana Marinescu, an assistant professor of labor market economics at the University of Pennsylvania, says research shows that there is little to no effect of a UBI on people’s propensity to work. As an example, she points to lottery winners, who oftentimes receive their winnings in recurring installments that mimic the frequency at which a UBI is distributed.\n\n“Whether in the U.S. or Sweden, most of [the winners] kind of keep doing what they were doing before, but feel more comfortable. Most people keep working, take a bit more vacation, feel more financially secure, and that’s about it,\" Marinescu said. \"It suggests that the changes are not enormous, except for the fact of feeling more financially secure.”\n\nNearly 30 years after the conclusion of a well-known guaranteed income trial that was conducted in the tiny town of Dauphin, in Canada’s Manitoba Province, Evelyn Forget, a health economist and professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the University of Manitoba, set out to debunk the same myth.\n\nKnown colloquially as “mincome,” the pilot in Dauphin had first launched in the 1970’s, she said, and researchers had been primarily interested in finding out whether or not basic income would cause recipients to work less or stop working altogether. According to Forget, their data showed a significant dropoff in employment in only two groups of Dauphin residents: new mothers, who had chosen to use the cash transfer to extend their maternity leave and spend more time with their infants, and “unattached males”—young men who were not married and had no children.\n\nThe fact that young men had appeared to work less “seemed to satisfy all the stereotypes people had—that is, if you give people a basic income, these young men are just going to run away from their responsibilities,” Forget said. But after seeking out some of those same “unattached males,” years later, further analysis soon confirmed what she had suspected all along: That the minimum income had, in fact, given their families the economic support to allow them to stay in school a bit longer instead of “dropping out at age 16 and going to get a job in agriculture and manufacturing” in order to help the struggling families stay afloat—an economic reality that had previously left many young men in the working-class town without options.\n\n“Some of these boys stayed in school and graduated and went on to college,” Forget said. “And so when you measure employment outcomes, yeah they worked a lot less—they worked a lot less because they were staying in high school just a little longer.”\n\nEducation, Forget points out, is often a key determinant of health and well-being: The more educated you are, the healthier you likely are to be at any age. In addition to the revelation that the guaranteed income had paved the way for better educational opportunities for that group of young men, her analysis of health care system data also uncovered that the entire population that received a basic income had 8.5 percent fewer hospitalizations, relative to a matched control group—for accidents and injuries, but also for mental health issues like anxiety and depression.\n\nAmerican researchers are also investigating the connection between economic precarity and mental health, and have found that economic hardship is likely a leading factor in the recent sharp uptick in suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related \"deaths of despair\" in the United States.\n\nBut just like the creation of more high-quality jobs won’t be enough to stanch the bleeding should our day of reckoning with the robot overlords come to pass, the implementation of a universal basic income won’t be enough to improve national mental health and reinvigorate a beleaguered American workforce on its own.\n\n“People deserve to be able to put food on the table, but they also deserve to make choices and get to pursue passions. It’s about both things.” Foster said. “It harkens back to the labor call for bread and roses—people need both.”\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Brianna Provenzano on Twitter."

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)\n\nBANGKOK (AP) — The virus outbreak in China has put South Korea's economy into an \"emergency situation,\" its president says. Japan is on the brink of recession and big manufacturers are forecasting a whole world of woe.\n\nAs many Chinese finally go back to work after their longest Lunar New Year holiday ever, the economic fallout from the outbreak that began in the central city of Wuhan may be just beginning. Companies are warning their bottom lines will take a hit, and governments are ramping up stimulus measures for economies that just weeks ago were hoping to see recoveries after months of uncertainty due to trade tensions and slowing global growth.\n\n“Emergency situations require emergency measures,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Tuesday, calling for aggressive action to support companies dependent on trade with China and encourage consumers to spend more.\n\n“The current situation is very serious, even more so than thought,\" Moon said. “We should put every measure we can think of on the table, regardless of whether there were precedents or not, and employ every means possible.”\n\nMany in the region were hoping that an easing of trade tensions thanks to a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff war would help revive sluggish trade this year. The virus outbreak has sideswiped the region with a raft of new, potentially much broader uncertainties.\n\nCentral banks across the region have already begun slashing interest rates to help ease credit as tourism arrivals plunge and manufacturing and delivery networks get entangled in bottlenecks caused by lockdowns inside China intended to help contain the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 1,870 people and infected more than 73,000 globally.\n\nAsian economies have grown increasingly reliant on trade with China and tourism catering to growing legions of Chinese travelers. The other regional powerhouse, Japan, saw its economy, the world's third-largest, contract by 6.3% in annual terms in the last quarter of 2019, even before the virus outbreak spiraled into a crisis.\n\nThe rebound in manufacturing and other business activity after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, in 2003 suggests the damage to manufacturing industries may be transient.\n\nBut the blow to regional tourism could persist, given the much broader travel restrictions and precautions put in place by regional governments and the much higher number of people affected: SARS killed fewer than 800 people and infected only about 8,000.\n\nChina has canceled two of the biggest business happenings of the year, a trade fair in southern China's Guangzhou and the Beijing auto show, adding to the growing number of conferences and sports events being postponed or called off due to the outbreak.\n\nTourism arrivals in Thailand, Singapore and other regional hubs are down sharply, leaving many who depend on steady flows of Chinese and other travelers scrambling for alternative ways to get by.\n\nEconomists are now forecasting that China's growth could stall into the low single digits in this quarter, while Japan, where dozens of people have been confirmed infected with the virus, is almost certainly headed for recession.\n\n“The biggest unknown is whether the crisis will result in a major drop in spending by Japanese consumers,\" Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economic said in a commentary. “While the new coronavirus isn’t as deadly as SARS, it’s still possible that consumer spending will come under pressure as households refrain from visiting shops and restaurants.\"\n\n“There’s clearly a risk that Japan slides into recession at the start of this year,\" he said.\n\nGovernments elsewhere are also preparing to act to cushion the blow from the virus. Singapore's government announced Tuesday a budget with an extra 6.4 billion Singapore dollars ($4.6 billion) in special measures to provide extra health care funding and subsidies for businesses and households.\n\nFarmers in Southeast Asia, especially tropical regions along southern Chinese borders, are struggling to find markets for crops unable to make it to market due to transport disruptions and quarantine restrictions in central and eastern China.\n\nExports of pungent durian fruit from Thailand to Malaysia have slowed, causing prices that had surged thanks to ravenous demand from China to plunge in recent weeks."

DeBra, the bank’s spokeswoman, said in a press release.\n\nThe bank’s celebration also comes after upbeat year-end and fourth-quarter earnings reports released Jan. 28.\n\nFirst Northern Community Bancorp, the bank’s holding company, reported 2019 profits of $14.7 million, a new record, or $1.14 per diluted share, climbing nearly 17 percent, compared to profits of $12.6 million, or 97 cents per diluted share, for 2018, the rise attributed to “higher mortgage loan production, increasingly stronger” business operations, bank president and CEO Louise Walker advised in a prepared statement.\n\nAdditionally, the bank reported profits of $3.6 million, or 28 cents per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, compared to profits of $3.3 million, or 26 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2018.\n\nTotal assets at year’s end were nearly $1.3 billion, an increase of $42.7 million, or 3.4 percent, compared to 2018. Total deposits at year’s end were $1.14 billion, an increase of $14 million, or 1.3 percent, compared to 2018. Total net loans (including loans classified as held-for-sale) at year’s end were $773 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 1 percent, compared to 2018. The company also continued to be “well capitalized” under regulatory definitions, exceeding the 10 percent total risk-based capital ratio threshold at the end of the year, DeBra said.\n\nThe company also reported that it would issue a 5 percent stock dividend on March 25 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 28.\n\nThe bank had its genesis when a group of Dixon businesspeople believed they weren’t getting the kind of banking services they needed, “so in the do-it-yourself tradition of an independent farming community, they voted to open their own bank,” an using all-local assets and “no outside investment or affiliations,” DeBra wrote in the release. Today, descendants of the bank’s founders are still shareholders and customers, she said.\n\nThe bank “has always been a pillar of strength in the communities it serves,” said Walker. “We attribute our success to remaining true to our core values.” They are “People First, Absolute Integrity, and having a Zest for Excellence,” she added.\n\nThe bank’s goals and objectives are not driven by the ups and downs of Wall Street, noted DeBra.\n\nRather, it focuses on the local economy and “relationship banking” instead of “reaching into unfamiliar markets,” she added.\n\nBesides its branches, the bank also has a commercial loan office in Contra Costa County, and mortgage loan offices in Davis and Sonoma. And, to serve the region’s investment and brokerage services needs, First Northern also provides non-FDIC insured products and services through Raymond James Financial Services Inc. under the name of First Northern Advisors, part of bank’s wealth management division.\n\nBank leaders also invest their time and plow some of the bank’s money back into the communities it serves. Over the past 13 years, it has contributed more than $2 million to local communities in the form of direct financial support and in-kind services. Each year during that same time period, First Northern employees have averaged over 7,000 hours of volunteer time, DeBra pointed out."

(Image credit: TechNode/Shi Jiayi)\n\nIn Shiyan, Hubei, Jiang Xiaosa wants to buy a tablecloth off e-commerce platform Taobao. But no deliveries are coming to Shiyan, so she’s waiting to place the order. Normally, Jiang, who owns a baijiu shop in Hebei province, would have left Hubei weeks ago. Instead, she’s living a low tech life while waiting for the quarantine to end.\n\nDeliveries still make their way into Wuhan, the first city that went into quarantine following the Covid-19 outbreak. But Shiyan is a tier three city 600 kilometers from Wuhan.\n\nThe digital economy was one of the first things to go when quarantine started.\n\nThe virus has dealt a blow to e-commerce and food deliveries, but consumers in tier one cities still depend on them to avoid now-risky supermarket trips. In Beijing, fresh produce platforms like Alibaba’s Hema saw a surge in demand. In Shanghai, local platform Dingdong feeds families. Those that order takeout on apps like Ele.me must wait longer and pick up deliveries left outside, notified by a call from the delivery man once he’d already left.\n\nThat’s not what getting food looks like in third-tier Hubei. While e-commerce companies may be helping to deliver supplies in the background, people are living like their interfaces, the likes of Taobao and Ele.me don’t exist. In Shiyan and neighboring Xiangyang, there have been no parcels since the quarantine began, and food delivery is close to non-existent. The low tech era is back.\n\nLow tech food\n\nBefore the virus emerged, residents preferred brick-and-mortar for groceries. People in Shiyan can usually walk downstairs to a local store, usually at the foot of the residential compound.\n\nThis lasted until the local government asked people to stop going outdoors on Feb. 2. Loudspeakers started broadcasting rhymes discouraging shopping trips: “If you have one grain of rice, don’t go out in the crowds; if you have one stalk of spring onion, don’t rush to the market.”\n\nThe local store moved some of its produce into the apartment compound. Jiang can now buy tangerines without venturing onto the street.\n\nLow tech fresh food networks have sprung up. The local neighborhood Party committee is now the equivalent of a Hema delivery man. Jiang can scan a QR code, join a WeChat group, and post a list of what she’s run out of. She says that the neighborhood committee also collects her rubbish and helps pay her gas bill.\n\nA resident in Jiang’s building had symptoms similar to the coronavirus and no one from that building was allowed to leave the compound for a week. Jiang is considering joining the Party committee as a volunteer just so she can get outside more often.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Xiangyang, Zhong Shaoxiong manages on his own. Unlike Shiyan, his neighborhood committee does not deliver groceries. They have barred his family from leaving their residential compound since Feb. 1, when cases were discovered within.\n\n“There’s a nearby supermarket; we have their WeChat, we tell them what to buy, they send groceries to the gate of the compound,” said Zhong. He pays at the gate, which separates the local supermarket’s staff and himself.\n\nCooked food delivery is totally gone in Shiyan. It’s almost gone in Xiangyang. There was one shop open on Ele.me in the whole city when Zhong checked at 7 p.m on Feb. 11. The choices aren’t bad. Among them are prawn fried noodles, fried rice with Laoganma chili sauce, and Sprite to wash it down. Before the virus, Zhong said, “food delivery was everywhere in Xiangyang.”\n\nE-commerce companies operate in the background. Pinduoduo, for instance, has told Xinhua (in Chinese) that it has shipped agricultural produce to Xiangyang. Fu Zheng, Pinduoduo’s team head for epidemic control, said in the interview that the company has set up new procurement and purchasing channels to circumvent road closures and disruption of normal logistics and that it bought over 100 tons of fresh vegetables and fruit and delivered them to 16 hospitals across seven cities in Hubei.\n\nNothing comes in, nothing goes out\n\nQuarantine has thrown Shiyan’s residents into a pre-Taobao world. Local governments have implemented strict and varying rules on what is allowed in and out. Nothing comes in unless it’s of the turnip or mask variety, and these go straight to supermarkets or pharmacies. Individual deliveries don’t get past the roadblocks.\n\nTechNode writer Wei Sheng posted masks to his parents who live in a village near Huanggang city on Jan. 26. His parents were waiting to collect the parcel from the nearest town, Gaoqiaozhen. Three weeks later, they are yet to arrive. “I’ve given up,” he said.\n\nPeople are getting by without Taobao, but they miss it. Local residents in Shiyan said that they were among its earliest adopters. After placing an order, the seller would call to confirm. The buyer would traipse to the local post office and send money directly to the seller’s account. It could be a ten-day wait before the parcel arrived at the local postal point. “The first people to use it were brave,” said Jiang. The most popular purchases, said her daughter, Yaning, were nicer clothes and shoes then unavailable in the city’s shops.\n\nJiang can wait on the tablecloth. But there are other problems. During her time in quarantine, her washing machine has broken. She ordered a new one off JD.com.\n\nNot only are no parcels coming in—none are going out. She wanted to post the key to her shop to a colleague back in Hebei. No one would come to pick it up.\n\nCut off from the digital economy, Jiang isn’t worried about not being able to sit down to home-cooked meals—the Party committee guarantees that. What she doesn’t know is when she can go back to work and use her washer.\n\n"

            "content": "Some of these economic impacts derive from the demand side of the economy, which will be transitory.\n\nConsider a variety of specifics, not because any one is large, but because taken together they highlight the world's supply chains.\n\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus has the world's business system in a spin. Economists tend to downplay it as not terribly big in comparison to the huge global economy. For specific families, of course, it's a tragedy. But the mild economic consequences of economists' back-of-the-envelope economic analyses likely understate the magnitude of the harm to business activity.\n\nConsider a variety of specifics, not because any one is large, but because taken together they highlight the world's supply chains.\n\n· Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner said that he is concerned about the supply chain. China has the company's largest number of employees after Germany.\n\n· \"… all supply chains seem vulnerable because so many Chinese supply chains within supply chains within supply chains rely on each other for parts and raw materials. That tiny valve that is inside a motor that you are sourcing for your US-made product is made in China. So are the rare earth elements you require to manufacture magnets and electronics…and on and on. Purchasing departments declaring that they have alternate non-Chinese suppliers, may be naïve in thinking that their domestic suppliers don't rely on parts from China and that shortages are eminent.\" (Rosemary Coates, Executive Director of the Reshoring Institute and the President of Blue Silk Consulting, writing for Logistics Management.) · \"From iPhones to LCD televisions, much of the world's consumer technology is either made in China, or relies on parts made there. The nation is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, computers, and televisions. It exports billions of dollars of goods every year\" wrote technology reporter Amrita Khalid in Quartz.\n\n\n\nQingdao Port. Chinese shipping has declined since the virus took hold. (Photo by Yu Fangping/VCG via Getty Images\n\nEarlier the Wall Street Journal reported that Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) shut down a factory in China that accounted for 10% of production of its most popular jet, Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMLF) idled all seven plants in South Korea for lack of parts from Chinese suppliers, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) closed its Shanghai factory and warned of delivery delays.\n\nThese stories highlight a critical difference between aggregate economic thinking and supply chain thinking. We economists tend to look at the supply of goods as determined by labor, capital and current technological possibilities. We lump together all labor and all capital as a first approximation. In the long run, it's a very good approximation. We can do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of how the epidemic's effects compare to the overall economy.\n\nSupply chain thinking, on the other hand, emphasizes the specificity of parts. An automobile is not made of steel and glass and rubber. Instead, it's a collection of some 10,000 components. A car manufacturer is better thought of as an assembler than a producer. So the company buys a dashboard module from a vendor. That module includes a display that shows speed and other items, and often a second display for radio and climate control. Pretty far removed from the display-technologically speaking - is the foam padding that protects occupants in crashes. Airbags are also integrated into the dashboard. Look carefully and you'll also see covers to keep sunlight from interfering with visibility of the displays, vents for heat and air conditioning, and so forth.\n\n\n\nAn automobile air conditioning production line in China. If one component is unavailable, no AC and no car. (Photo credit STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOne automotive analyst, Mark Boyadjis, says that car companies now work with six to ten suppliers for dashboard elements, but are trying to get that number down to two or three. Some of the components are even more complicated than the dashboard itself. Consider the airbag. A central control unit - not part of the dashboard - send the signal to deploy, then an electrical wire deliberately overheats, setting off an explosion that creates gas, which is vented by the passenger's pressure against the bag. Every part of the device is made of different materials, many in multi-step processes.\n\nVisualize the many parts of a dashboard and then consider the engine, transmission, braking system, air conditioning, and so on. Now consider that the car cannot be sold without each component of each module. A closed factory in Wuhan may not be an obvious supplier to a car manufacturer, but it may manufacture one component needed by a certain module in a particular system that is vital for the car to be finished. Supply chain thinking emphasizes that any complex product needs many, many components delivered on time, at specification.\n\nMost purchasing managers try to have multiple suppliers for any given component, or at least one supplier with multiple plants in different parts of the world. However, it is sometimes hard to know if the multiple suppliers all use the same component produced by the same factory, as Rosemary Coates noted above. Chinese legal expert Dan Harris emphasized supply chain risks based on questions his firm's attorneys are hearing about production in Chines factories.\n\nHow bad could the economic effects be? I know of no way to get an accurate handle on the extent of supply chain failures, so gut feel is the only forecasting strategy available. We know the epidemic is serious, but not yet pandemic - that is, it has not spread worldwide.\n\nSome of these economic impacts derive from the demand side of the economy, which will be transitory. A family eats at home instead of at a restaurant, saving money. On the day of that decision, spending is lower than usual. But the family has more money in its bank account than usual. Eventually, that money will be spent. So weak spending during this phase of the epidemic will be offset by stronger spending in the future.\n\nPast pandemics, such as SARS and even the Spanish flu, are hard to find in the economic data. Death rates certainly increased, but this virus seems do the most harm to the elderly and to people with co-morbidities (unrelated illnesses that make them more vulnerable). Before we become too complacent, however, human history shows that disease can have devastating economic consequences.\n\nIn time we may worry most about falling demand, but in the meantime supply chains present the greatest economic threat to business from the COVID-19 virus.\n\nOriginal post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nThe Diamond Princess, operated by Carnival Corp, has been quarantined after arriving in the port of Yokohama on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus.\n\nMore than 540 people have been infected with the virus on the liner, which originally carried some 3,700 passengers and crew. Many of those infected have already been transferred to hospitals. About half the passengers are Japanese.\n\nJapan ranks second in the world after China in number of confirmed virus due to the ship infections.\n\nJapan has come under fire for its handling of the cruise ship quarantine, although top government officials have defended the quarantine and onboard testing operation.\n\n“Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital,” public broadcaster NHK quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as telling a parliamentary panel.\n\nAround 500 people were expected to disembark on Wednesday, a health ministry official said, with the entire process completed by Friday.\n\n“Day:15: Everyone here, thanks for your support over the last two weeks,” tweeted one departing passenger from Hong Kong with the handle #quarantinedondiamondprincess. “If you ever find yourself quarantined in a windowless room but with access to WIFI, note you can count on people around the world to help.”\n\nNHK said that those who had roomed with passengers who tested positive would have to stay on the ship another 14 days from the time the infected roommate left.\n\nCrew members, who have been sharing rooms, would move to separate rooms and undergo health checks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.\n\nThe United States evacuated more than 300 nationals on Monday on two chartered flights and six South Koreans and one Japanese spouse flew to South Korea on Wednesday morning on a chartered flight.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the quarantine “may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship”.\n\nThe rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, is a risk, it said.\n\nMore than 100 Americans remain onboard or in hospital in Japan, the CDC said. After disembarking from the ship, passengers or crew will be required to wait 14 days without symptoms or a positive coronavirus test before traveling to the United States, the CDC said.\n\nAsked why the Americans faced an additional two-week quarantine but Japanese leaving the ship did not, Suga said it was based on the advice of Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID).\n\nThe NIID said that based on the experience of those who returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, on charter flights earlier this month, there should be no obstacle to using public transport and the like if people had shown no symptoms such as fever for 14 days and had tested negative for the virus during the period their health was under surveillance.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday there were 220 Australians on board and that a total of 169 would be evacuated. Those evacuated will be flown to Darwin, where they will be quarantined for 14 days.\n\nAn Australian passenger said Australians had been told they would be pre-screened starting on Wednesday morning and taken to Tokyo’s Haneda airport in the evening for an expected departure early Thursday.\n\n“They told us to pack warm weather clothes for the two weeks in Darwin but who will have that after a cruise in the Japanese winter,” passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters.\n\nA captain’s announcement on the liner said that Hong Kong passengers would also be evacuated over the next 24 hours and that according to information received, a Canadian charter flight would arrive on Friday morning.\n\nItaly, Israel, Britain and Taiwan were also preparing to evacuate their nationals, said Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.\n\nBesides those on the cruise liner and returnees brought home from Wuhan city, about 60 cases of domestic infections have been confirmed in Japan, including 22 in Tokyo, NHK public broadcaster said.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nAmid worries about a contracting economy, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to curb the size of public gatherings and some companies are telling employees to work from home.\n\nThe spread of the virus has also raised concerns about the outlook for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, set to start on July 24, although organizers have said there are no plans to cancel the Summer Games.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was considering visiting Japan for the Games at the invitation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe."

            "content": "The streets of Beijing are empty on February 10, 2020, as residents attempt to avoid catching the Wuhan coronavirus. (Photo: Getty)\n\nOver the past few decades, the world has become connected in unprecedented ways. And in 2020, we’re living with those impacts in full force.\n\nThe most in-your-face example is COVID-19, which has spread with alarming speed to 26 countries, killed nearly 1,800, and led to widespread quarantines as health authorities struggle to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organisation has declared it a global health emergency, and the coronavirus has the potential to become a pandemic. The hyper-connectivity of the world is partly why as a cruise ship and flights with infected passengers have allowed the virus to spread.\n\nThe virus could also affect the global economy, including even slightly cutting China’s greenhouse gas emissions. While the climate impacts are a tiny footnote in the story of coronavirus, the virus’ spread and the way the climate crisis has grown both make a compelling case for everything that’s wrong with globalization—and where we need to start fixing things if we want humanity to thrive in the 21st century.\n\nCountries now depend on one another for basically everything. And their economies are connected by tourism, manufactured goods, and services. Oil and gas are shipped around the world, fuelling the economy and driving our climate into an unsteady state. When disaster strikes in one place, the impacts can ripple around the globe. We can see that today with the coronavirus outbreak and the risk of a global economic slowdown. And we can see it every day with climate change. Burning dirty coal in India impacts glaciers melting in the Antarctic because greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem even if they come from local sources.\n\nThese emissions have also shot up as a result of the globalised economy. International shipping contributed an estimated billion tons of greenhouse gases between 2007 and 2012. Maritime routes are key to the transportation system that allows goods to move from one country to another, worsening the climate crisis.\n\nEven the goods themselves are part of the problem. Though China is the largest emitter globally, a large portion of its emissions are due to goods made there and exported globally. In essence, countries like the U.S. and European Union members have outsourced some of their emissions to China.\n\nAt the heart of all this is, well, people. As convenient as globalisation may be in driving down the prices of consumer goods for the Global North, it’s hurting many people in the Global South, where poor working conditions and wages allow companies to keep the price of goods like T-shirts or headphones so low. Unfortunately, those same people are left to carry a disproportionate burden from climate change despite having contributed very little to the problem themselves. These same vulnerable populations are most at risk if deadly viruses such as COVID-19 reach their communities because their governments are less equipped to contain such outbreaks.\n\nThanks to globalisation, people can’t ignore what’s happening across the world either. We’re connected by the atmosphere, the movement of goods and people, and public health. Benjamin Hale, a philosophy and environmental studies associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Gizmodo that globalisation “has made these problems apparent to us in a way that they wouldn’t have otherwise been.”\n\nOn the flip side of that, globalisation has connected us all in a way people decades ago might’ve never imagined. And that is also fuel for the environmental movement and finding solutions to the current mess we’re in. As 350.org founder Bill McKibben told Gizmodo, globalisation has made it possible for people around the world to connect and build the case for transformative change in ways that were previously unimaginable. This type of movement has the potential to alter the economic system that is threatening our well-being and the planet’s.\n\nThere’s still value in the local, of course. Distributed energy systems like rooftop or community solar, for example, have the potential to loosen the grip of utility monopolies. And for disenfranchised communities, there’s a huge potential for local green manufacturing. That being said, globalisation is necessary, especially when it comes to supporting those most hurt by the impacts of climate.\n\n“Countries like the U.S. have dramatically upset the climate of the planet, and so it’s wrong for them to then bar the door and say, ‘We’re not letting in those people who have to leave their homes because they can no longer grow food where they live,’” McKibben told Gizmodo.\n\nSo while the coronavirus outbreak and the climate crisis show what can happen with globalisation gone wrong, there are still ways to leverage global society for ways that are beneficial and even necessary. The climate crisis and COVID-19 are shocks showing the risks we face, but the world shouldn’t need such a scare to change its ways. There are signs like China’s major investments in renewables or recent decisions by major financial firms to curtail their fossil fuel investments that the globalised economy may already be shifting, but it’s nowhere close to done yet.\n\n“Big money is globalised,” McKibben said. “We have to make people power globalised, too.”"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2020\n\nThe President was responding to the below tweet from Obama, sent on President’s Day, which claimed that Obama’s Recovery Act “paved the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history.”\n\nEleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history. pic.twitter.com/BmdXrxUAUf — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) February 17, 2020\n\nAs Trump urged, however, the economy under Obama was the most worst since World War II, despite being largely propped up by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented decade-long zero percent interest rates during his two terms.\n\nThe White House also issued a statement responding to Obama.\n\n“President Trump reversed every single failed Obama-era economic policy, and with it, reversed the floundering Obama/Biden economy,” read the statement from Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary. “Obama and Biden orchestrated the worst economic recovery in modern history.”\n\n“By contrast, though, deregulating, lowering taxes, and supporting free-market policies, President Trump has created the hottest economy on record, with unemployment hitting generational lows and all-time lows for African Americans, Hispanics, the disabled, veterans and many other hard-working Americans,” added McEnany.\n\nAnd, it’s not just Trump and Infowars pointing this out.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently asked 68 economists who was responsible for the booming economy and the consensus was that it is “President Trump, and not Obama, who should be taking a bow.”\n\nIt has been blindingly obvious for years that Obama did not seed the current recovery. “The Obama recovery of the last seven years remains the worst in postwar American history,” a Forbes article from 2016 noted.\n\nOthers were quick to respond to Obama’s phoney claim:\n\nThe notion that you did anything but destroy this nation’s economy is beyond hilarious. “Those jobs are never coming back. What’s he going to do, wave a magic wand?” Yes, @realDonaldTrump did exactly that.

            "content": "When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported blowout fiscal Q1 earnings results last month, it warned that the coronavirus outbreak could impact its results for the quarter ending in March. The company incorporated a relatively wider range in its revenue guidance to accommodate for the heightened uncertainty. That was three weeks ago, and conditions have only gotten worse as the epidemic continues to spread.\n\nYesterday, Apple issued a warning to investors saying that it now expects to miss its revenue guidance.\n\nSupply constraints and reduced demand in China\n\nFor reference, Apple's outlook had called for revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion in the current quarter. Due to the ongoing crisis, Apple says it is doubling its donations to public health groups that are trying to contain the coronavirus. Workers recently started to return to work from the Chinese New Year holiday but Apple is \"experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated\" and does \"not expect to meet the revenue guidance\" it provided last month.\n\nThe Cupertino tech giant cited two primary factors: Global iPhone supply will be impacted and demand within China is also being hurt. Even though most of Apple's contract manufacturing facilities are located outside of Hubei province -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- ramping production back up to normal levels is taking longer than expected as Apple takes the necessary precautions for worker safety. Apple has closed all of its stores in China, and the company plans to \"gradually\" reopen stores as safely as possible. Corporate offices had been temporarily closed but have since reopened.\n\nDemand outside of China is largely unaffected and remains strong, according to Apple, although supply constraints may hurt the company's ability to meet that demand.\n\nIt's different this time\n\nApple had kicked off 2019 with a similar warning that it would miss its revenue guidance, but that episode was more concerning since it was more related to poor execution on Apple's part. At the time, Apple was struggling to sell iPhones in China, upgrade activity in developed markets was sluggish, and the company suggested that high prices were hurting demand.\n\nIn contrast, the coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency far beyond Apple's control, one that will impact many companies and major world economies. For example, Japan just reported the biggest quarterly decline in GDP in six years, in part due to coronavirus risks, putting the third-largest economy in the world on the brink of recession. Japan is also an important market for Apple, representing roughly 7% of sales last quarter.\n\nApple is prioritizing health and safety while emphasizing that the challenges are temporary in nature. The crisis continues to evolve rapidly and the company will provide more detail when it reports fiscal second-quarter results in April."

You can sign up here.\n\nEnlarge this image Vincenco Giovannini/Wikimedia Commons Vincenco Giovannini/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics released its jobs report this month, and the numbers, again, are pretty good: the unemployment rate is at 3.6%, while the youth unemployment rate is around 8%. The numbers looked good to us. But to our winter intern, Bianca Giacobone, they seemed astonishingly high. That's because she is from Italy, where the economy has been stuck for decades. So we asked her to write about what it's like to be young and Italian these days.\n\nSometimes, when people ask me why on earth I left Italy, a beautiful country I'm lucky enough to call home, I drop a few numbers. Italy's youth unemployment rate – the rate of people under 25 years old looking for a job and not finding it – is 28.6% as of the last quarter of 2019, according to Eurostat, the European Statistical Office. By comparison, in November 2019 the Eurozone's youth unemployment rate overall was 15.6%. Here in the U.S. it's about 8%.\n\nPerhaps more worryingly, the Italian rate of people aged 20-34 neither in employment nor in education and training, the so-called NEET rate, was 28.9% in 2018. It's the highest NEET rate in the Eurozone, which has an average of 16.5%. To put that more plainly, almost 1 in 3 Italians under 34 aren't really doing anything at all.\n\n\"The Italian economy is not growing,\" says Carlo Cottarelli, an Italian economist and former director of the International Monetary Fund. \"The Italian per capita income is the same as it was 20 years ago. In terms of economic growth, this past decade has been the worst since 1861.\"\n\nLike many economists, Cottarelli has a long list of reasons why Italy's economy is stuck, and they start with Italy's adoption of the common currency in 2002. \"We didn't handle the transition to the Euro well,\" he says, explaining that a common rate of exchange meant Italy couldn't lower prices to compete with Germany. \"Since we couldn't devalue, we lost competitiveness.\"\n\nThen there are the usual suspects: excess of bureaucracy, one of the slowest civil justice processes in Europe, high levels of tax avoidance, high levels of corruption, a crippling economic division between North and South, and one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. \"All these things, including an underfunded public education, condition the country's growth.\"\n\nIn the long term, high youth unemployment can lead to loss of skills and human capital. In the short term, youth unemployment shapes the lives of young Italians dramatically. For example, people tend to live with their parents longers – 66.1% of people aged 18-34 still lived with their parents in 2018, while the percentage in United States is roughly 30%. Young Italians struggle to reach financial independence. They have children late, which contributes to Italy having one of the worst fertility rates in the world. And, then they leave, as I did.\n\nMany Italians blame the education system, which is chronically underfunded, and favors theory over practice, leading to a very slow school-to-work transition, and to a mismatch between what young people graduate in and the skills needed to find work.\n\nGraduating with degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) leads to better employment prospects. But my father's reminder that it would be best to study engineering fell on deaf years when I was 19 and fresh out of high school. I enrolled in the Humanities, as many other Italians before and after me.\n\nAnecdotally, I can say that the overwhelming majority of the friends and acquaintances living back home, all over 25 years old, do not have jobs and/or are still living with their parents. And that around 20% of my small high school graduating class, me included, is now living abroad, and that five out of five of my cousins under 30 years old are not working in Italy at the moment. Friends have gone to the United Kingdom, Germany, Portugal, South Africa, and the United States, among many others. They're pursuing Phds, working as managers, servers, engineers, professors, chefs, and architects.\n\nWe all look longingly back at our country, wondering when and if there'll be a good moment to go back, and have a job and a career comparable to the one we can have abroad. Because, as most of the world knows, Italy is a beautiful country, where the coffee is cheap, the food is good, holidays are long, education is mostly free, and there is universal health care, despite all the economic trouble.\n\nDavide Fikri Kamel, who comes from Corvino San Quirico, a bucolic village in the north of Italy, and works a well paid job with Amazon's digital marketing division in New York City, is used to his colleagues' surprise at his desire to leave Italy. \"Every time I show pictures and videos of my village, to my coworkers and friends they're like, 'Why on earth would you move out of this dreamy, heavenly place?'\" he says. \"But you don't know what the struggle is, you don't know how the Italian education system is, you don't know what the job situation is.\"\n\n\"Some 2 million young Italians – many of them educated and skilled – have left Italy since 2008,\" says Nicola Nobile, an economist at the research and analytics consultancy Oxford Economics. That's a lot in a country with a population of about 60 million. Immigration, which could help counteract the low fertility rate, is relatively recent in Italy – under 3% of Italy's population were immigrants before 2000, a number that now lingers around 10% – and so far it's not well received.\n\n\"A country that cannot keep its youth is not forward looking,\" says Nobile. \"There are more older voters than young, so politicians tend to focus their politics and economic incentives on them. It's a country for old people.\"\n\nI am reminded of that every time I go back home to Milan and go for a walk. People around the streets, in bars, shops and cafes, are strikingly older than what I'm used to now that I live in New York.\n\nI like to think I'll be back. I've written down a ten year plan. I'll work for a few years abroad, here in the United States, or somewhere in Europe, and build my career. Then, when my resume is appealing enough, I'll move back and be of use. It's a plan that comes less out of patriotic duty, and more out of a refusal to accept displacement. Yes, that's my dream, to work in the country where I grew up.\n\nDid you enjoy this newsletter?

            "content": "Immigrants are needed to rescue Americans who cannot keep pace with the high-tech economy, Mike Bloomberg told an elite audience at Oxford University.\n\n“You have to have a different skill set; you have to have a lot more gray matter” to prosper in America’s high-tech economy, he said in 2016, adding:\n\nIt’s not clear the teachers can teach, or the students can learn … The solution to our problems is more open borders, not closed borders [because] … If you don’t have successful people, you’re never going to have the wherewithal to support, to help, those who are not [succesful].\n\nBloomberg’s call for more skilled immigration matches his own business activities, and it is a central part of his 2020 campaign for the presidency, just as reduced immigration was a fundamental part of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.\n\nBoth candidates are racing towards a November 2020 finishing line amid growing evidence that U.S. companies have imported at least one million Indian visa workers to take jobs and careers from at least one million American graduates and their children.\n\nPresident Trump has mostly blocked the illegal migration of blue-collar migrants into the United States, but he has done little to stop the white-collar replacement. But Bloomberg is promising to make the replacement of American employes and graduates into a foundation of his technocratic vision.\n\nMany Americans do not have the brainpower to keep pace in a high-tech economy, said Bloomberg, who has an estimated wealth of $60 billion:\n\nThe agrarian society lasted 3000 years, and we could teach processes [to almost everyone]. I could teach anybody — even people in this [elite university] room, so no offense intended — to be a farmer. It’s a process: you dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. Then you have 300 years of the industrial society: You put the piece of metal on the lathe, turn the crank the direction of the arrow, and you can have a job. We created a lot of jobs. One point, 98 percent of the world worked in agriculture. Today it’s two percent of the United States. Now comes the information economy. And the information economy is fundamentally different because it’s built around replacing people with technology. The skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze and that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter — it’s not clear the teachers can teach or the students can learn.\n\nThe United States may be destabilized if these less-intelligent people cannot get decent jobs, he said:\n\nAnd so the challenge for society to find jobs for these people — whom we can take care of, giving them a roof over their head, and a meal in their stomach, and a cell phone, and a car, and that sort of thing. But the thing that’s the most important, that will stop them from setting up the guillotine someday, is the dignity of a job. Nobody has yet come up with a simple solution in this day and age to how we create jobs, particularly for people already out of school.\n\nBut people want jobs with a purpose, Bloomberg noted;\n\nYou take the money from the rich, and you give it to the poor. You do it for altruistic reasons. You do it because you don’t want the poor on your doorstep and a variety of things. But I think what you’ve got to understand is the people who are getting the subsidy want the dignity of a job. They want the dignity of being responsible for their family and being able to take care of it. And that’s the conundrum we’re going to have here because technology is reducing the ability to give them the jobs.\n\nGovernment policy has to solve the jobs and dignity problem, he said, because business must be left alone to generate value for shareholders:\n\nBusinesses’ job is to take their investors’ money and to maximize the money by creating products that the public wants and are willing to pay for. And you can’t say to them, they should go and create jobs deliberately. You can have a tax policy that encourages that, and that’s one of the things you should do and then use the collective wisdom of all of the heads of companies to create jobs small pockets and it adds up to a lot of jobs.\n\nCorporate immigration is needed to import the cleverest people so companies can generate the income needed for government spending, he argues:\n\nThe world is more complex than ever before. It is more dangerous than ever before because of technology and weapons and that sort of thing and free travel and that sort of thing … If you don’t have successful people, you’re never going to have the wherewithal to support, to help those who are not.\n\nIn his 2020 campaign, Bloomberg has repeated his claim that U.S. business needs clever migrants. “This country needs more immigrants, and we should be out looking for immigrants,” Bloomberg told the San Diego Union-Tribune on January 5:\n\nFor those who need an oboe player for a symphony, we want the best one. We need a striker for a soccer team, we want to get the best one. We want a farmworker, we want to get the best one. A computer programmer, we want to get the best one. So we should be out looking for more immigrants.\n\nIn December, Bloomberg said additional immigrants could “improve our culture, our cuisine, our religion, our dialogue, and certainly improve our economy” — but without being asked by reporters which Americans’ culture, cuisine, religion, and dialogue do not meet his standards.\n\nBloomberg — and the establishment media — have ignored the vat evidence that large-scale legal migration shifts vast wealth from ordinary Americans to investors, from young to old, and from central states to coastal states.\n\nHis campaign posts multiple tweets showing Bloomberg’s calls for more immigration — but wraps his demands for foreign labor within poll-tested claims about a “broken immigration system,” and the Cold War-era claim that Americans’ homeland is really a “Nation of Immigrants”:\n\nThe America I know welcomes the world. Trump's America is not that America. But, we can turn the page on this shameful chapter in our country's history. Together, we can fix our broken immigration system once and for all. pic.twitter.com/jNiTSZsKSw — Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) February 11, 2020\n\nI believe we can once again be a country that welcomes immigrants, values immigrants, respects immigrants, and empowers them to pursue the American Dream. https://t.co/q14X4YlFGP pic.twitter.com/mX08mXxpAh — Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) January 31, 2020\n\nWithout immigrants, Americans wouldn't have hamburgers or blue jeans — and Trump wouldn't have his current, very temporary, residence. pic.twitter.com/gZfosf3AuY — Team Bloomberg (@Mike2020) February 13, 2020\n\nBloomberg also operates his own company by importing immigrants. For example, MyVisJobs.com shows that he asked for almost 1,500 H-1B visa workers from 2017 to 2019 at an average wage of $160,000.\n\nBloomberg has also sponsored almost 700 foreigners for green cards, including 275 Indians, 253 Chinese, and 73 Canadians.\n\nBloomberg joined the 2020 race, in part, because Sen. Bernie Sanders took the lead in the Democratic polling. For Bloomberg, Sanders and President Donald Trump are the two extremes of American politics, while his elite, technocratic leadership is centrist:\n\nWe’ve tried socialism [in Russia], it doesn’t work, and I’ll leave you with a thought: There was a guy, Bernie Sanders, who would have beaten Donald Trump. The polls showed he would have walked away with it. But Hillary Clinton got the nomination for a variety of reasons. What did [Sanders] stand for? He stood for something. He called it democratic socialism. And the young people — I don’t mean to knock young people, I wish I was one again — but, young people listen to Donald Trump, or to Bernie Sanders, and they said, “Yeah, democratic, that’s good. Socialism? Yeah, that’s that social media stuff.” Because our kids no longer learn civics in school, they no longer study Western history, they no longer read Western literature. We are trying to change and dumb down the [eduction] system. And if you don’t know what happened in the past, you’re going to have to re-live it. It’s unfortunate but true, and I think it’s very dangerous. The world we’re going into, you see both the left and the right coming up here, and the middle is getting — unfortunately — not listened to anymore, and the extremists are going to shape the political culture if we’re not careful going forward. And we’ve had extremism before, particularly on this [European] continent. It didn’t work out very well.\n\nThe view of Bloomberg, as a centrist — not an elite, globalist, technocrat investor — is widely shared by the establishment media that refuses to examine the impact of mass migration on Americans’ careers and wealth."

            "content": "China appreciates the support and solidarity that India has extended in its fight against the novel coronavirus, Beijing’s envoy said on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference, Sun Weidong said China and India have been in close contact to deal with the threat and assured that Beijing would look after Indian nationals in China as its own.\n\n“Virus is borderless and a common threat to everyone in the world. Facing this common challenge, we need to strengthen cooperation, enhance mutual understanding, show solidarity, and jointly overcome difficulties,” said Ambassador Sun emphasising that the threat from the coronavirus would be defeated by the joint efforts of China and the global community. He said kind gestures from common people in India had left a lasting impression on him.\n\nThe press interaction was the first since the outbreak late last year of the novel coronavirus epidemic, which has affected about 70,000 people inside China and posed a significant international health crisis. The diplomat maintained that the novel coronavirus disease was “preventable, controllable and curable” and that China had acted in a decisive manner to deal with the public health crisis.\n\nOn February 9, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to President Xi Jinping extending India’s assistance to fight the coronavirus outbreak. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had also spoken to his counterpart Wang Yi and urged an objective evaluation of the crisis. “We appreciate and thank the solidarity and support rendered by India,” said the ambassador.\n\nElaborating on the multi-layered measures activated by Beijing to deal with the crisis, China’s envoy highlighted the roles played by President Xi and Premier Li Keqiang in setting up emergency measures across all the 31 provinces of China. He acknowledged that the health crisis had made a “certain impact” on the Chinese economy but described the setback as “local, temporary and limited”.\n\nAmbassador Sun maintained that the Chinese government had coordinated with local universities in Hubei province to provide essential materials, and masks to Indian students in the region and helped them deal with the crisis. “We attach great importance to the health and safety of foreign nationals in China, and will take good care of the Indian citizens in China like our own,” he said. “I did learn about the situation of Indian students in Hubei province... they are taken good care of with good health, sufficient daily necessities, accommodation and food. So far there is no report of infection for the Indian citizens in China,” he added.\n\nThe envoy said both China and India were facing similar public health challenges and there was “huge potential” for collaboration to counter emerging threats. “We are ready to explore opportunities with India for cooperation in areas of public health and science,” the ambassador added."

(File Photo) The warning from the most valuable company in the United States sobered investor optimism that economic stimulus by Beijing and other countries would protect the global economy from the effects of the epidemic. (File Photo)\n\nAsian shares fell and Wall Street retreated from record highs on Tuesday after Apple Inc said it will not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter as the coronavirus outbreak slowed production and weakened demand in China.\n\nThe warning from the most valuable company in the United States sobered investor optimism that economic stimulus by Beijing and other countries would protect the global economy from the effects of the epidemic.\n\nS&P500 e-mini futures dipped as much as 0.3% in Asian trade.\n\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.65% while Tokyo’s Nikkei slid 1.0%. Shanghai shares dipped 0.2%, having gained in nine of the past 10 sessions largely on hopes for policy support by Beijing.\n\nChina’s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending on Monday, which is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday.\n\nBut sentiment was shaken when Apple told investors its manufacturing facilities in China have begun to re-open but are ramping up more slowly than expected, reinforcing signs of a broader hit to businesses from the epidemic.\n\n“Apple is saying its recovery could be delayed, which could mean the impact of the virus may go beyond the current quarter,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\n“If Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell.”\n\nAsian tech shares were also hit. Samsung Electronics dropped 2.1%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) lost 1.7% and Sony shed 2.6%.\n\nIn China, the number of new Covid-19 cases fell to 1,886 on Monday from 2,048 the day before. The World Health Organization cautioned on Monday, however, that “every scenario is still on the table” in terms of the epidemic’s evolution.\n\nAs China’s authorities try to prevent the spread of the disease, the economy is paying a heavy price. Some cities remained in lockdown, streets are deserted, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country, preventing migrant workers from getting back to their jobs.\n\nMany factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond, as highlighted by Apple.\n\n“Lifting travel restrictions is taking longer than expected. Initially we thought lockdowns would end in February and factory output would normalise in March. But that is looking increasingly difficult,” said Ei Kaku, currency strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nNomura downgraded its China first-quarter economic growth forecast to 3%, half the pace of the fourth quarter, from its previous forecast of 3.8%, and added there was a risk it could be even weaker.\n\nAlso hurting market sentiment was news that the Trump administration is considering changing US regulations to allow it to block shipments of chips to Huawei Technologies from companies such as Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker.\n\nBonds were in demand, with the 10-year US Treasuries yield falling 1.0 basis point to 1.578% after a US market holiday on Monday.\n\nSafe-haven gold also rose 0.18% to $1,584.80 per ounce.\n\nIn the currency market, the yen ticked up 0.1% to 109.75 yen per dollar while the risk-sensitive Australian dollar lost 0.4% to $0.6707. The yuan was steadier for now, trading at 6.9866 yuan per dollar.\n\nThe euro, grappling with worries about sluggish growth in the euro zone, edged down 0.1% to $1.0836, near its 33-month low of $1.0817 touched on Monday.\n\nOil prices also dipped.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose as high as $52.41 per barrel, before giving up gains to be $51.96 per barrel, down slightly on the day.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(Paul Yeung/Bloomberg/File) Hong Kong retail sales have been in free-fall for a year as the economy contracted for three consecutive quarters, dropping 19.4% in December as protesters, angry with Beijing’s perceived tightening grip over the city, clashed with police in shopping malls. (Paul Yeung/Bloomberg/File)\n\nTom Bennell’s olive oil distribution business took a heavy beating during months of pro-democracy protests that emptied Hong Kong hotels and restaurants, his major customers. Now he fears a knockout blow as the city fights the coronavirus.\n\nThe two-decade-old Olives and Oils supplies more than 20 five-star hotels, as well as clubs, delis and restaurants in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, where retail and tourism act like balance wheels for an economy running on trade and finance.\n\nThe coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,700 people across the border in mainland China and one of 60 patients in Hong Kong, has reduced tourist arrivals to a trickle and kept residents away from shops at a time when the city is mired in its first recession in a decade.\n\nBusiness is so bad that Bennell has pulled his two teenage sons out of international school to cut costs. If things don’t turn around, he might be forced to leave the city that has been home since 1993.\n\n“This is the straw that’s going to break the camel’s back. It’s horrific,” said the 46-year-old. “This is the worst I’ve ever seen it. It’s unbelievable.”\n\nHong Kong retail sales have been in free-fall for a year as the economy contracted for three consecutive quarters, dropping 19.4% in December as protesters, angry with Beijing’s perceived tightening grip over the city, clashed with police in shopping malls.\n\nCommunist Party rulers in Beijing deny meddling with the former British colony’s freedoms, guaranteed when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nRetail sales are expected to post their steepest fall on record in January at around 30%. Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong in February fell to under 3,000 a day on average, from around 100,000 in January, which was already less than half the traffic from January 2019.\n\n‘SUPER-COLD WINTER’\n\nThe Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades said more than 100 restaurants had closed.\n\nKwok Wang-hing, who works as a cook at a dim sum restaurant and chairs the Eating Establishment Employees’ General Union, said the restaurant business had dropped 30-50% during the protests, but the coronavirus had raised that to 70-80%.\n\n“It’s quite depressing. People in the industry … keep wondering when they’ll lose their jobs,” Kwok said. The Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong said a wave of closures of travel agents and related businesses had put more than 40,000 jobs at risk.\n\n“We are very worried and not sure how long we can hold on without any business,” council executive director Alice Chan told Reuters.\n\nThe Hong Kong Retail Management Association said it had entered “a super-cold winter” threatening its survival. The first 10 days of the Lunar New Year, the biggest holiday of the year, saw business falling 30-50% on average from last year’s equivalent period, with sales of jewellery, watches, cosmetics and clothing plunging as much as 80%.\n\nRestaurant chain LH Group Limited said it had temporarily closed all its On-Yasai and Mou Mou Club restaurants from Feb 13. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the city’s $11 billion purveyor of precious gems and watches, temporarily closed 40 points of sale in Hong Kong and neighbouring Macau, with the rest operating shorter hours.\n\nCosmetics chain Sa Sa International has closed some stores and said it will trim its Hong Kong workforce by up to 3% and cut salaries by 10-40% between March and May, aiming to cut costs by a third.\n\nUnemployment, now at 3.3%, is expected to pick up sharply this year. Owen Kwok, head of the Retail Frontline Union, said 800 of its 3,000 members had been asked to take unpaid leave.\n\nCat Hou, 28, chairwoman of the Bartender & Mixologists Union, lost her own job at a central cocktail lounge. The owner said either she or the manager had to be laid off and she decided to take the plunge.\n\nShe said the lounge survived last year with “after-protest people” turning up after police cleared the crowds from the streets.\n\n“There is no one at all now,” Hou said. Cheung Kwok-tsing, 61, used to work two weeks a month at restaurants and venues owned by the Peninsula Group and he could earn up to HK$800 ($100) a day. His income helped pay his HK$1,900 ($245) rent for four square metres in a subdivided flat and barely covered living expenses.\n\nThose restaurants were only open for two days in February.”Even if I don’t have enough to pay for food, there’s nothing I can do,” Cheung said. “Sometimes… I just eat a few slices of bread.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "content": "Factory activity in New York picked up in February, with new orders, inventories, and prices all increasing.\n\nThe business conditions index of the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, put out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, jumped 8.1 points from January’s reading to 12.9.\n\nThat is the highest reading since May of last year and above the consensus forecast of between 4.0 and 4.5. It is also the second consecutive monthly “beat” for this gauge, indicating the manufacturing activity in the State of New York is experiencing a much stronger than expected recovery from the doldrums of last year.\n\nThe New York Fed’s gauge of manufacturing activity declined sharply at the end of 2018 as global demand waned due to sluggish economic conditions around the world slower growth in the U.S. It took a second dive in May of last year, briefly turning negative and indicating contraction, and then remained at low but still positive levels for the rest of the year.\n\nThe survey’s measures of new orders, unfilled orders, shipments, delivery time, inventories and prices received all increased, painting a picture of healthy demand and business confidence.\n\nThe gauge of prices paid declined, indicating very little inflationary pressure. The measure for the number of employees also fell but remained positive, suggesting that employment growth continues despite unemployment in New York falling to the lowest level in over thirty years and remaining at that ultra-low level for six months.\n\nThe average employee workweek fell to a reading of negative one, which is a bit of an outlier considering the strength elsewhere in the survey.\n\nThe index looking at expected general business conditions six months ahead dipped a bit after January’s very strong reading. In fact, all but one of the indicators looking six months ahead came in lower. Notably, expectations for prices paid and prices received were lower, which could complicate the Federal Reserve’s attempt to raise inflation to its two percent target. Expectations for payroll growth grew, implying that businesses expect to be able to keep filling positions despite the ultralow employment level."

(AP Photo)\n\nJapan plans to start trials of HIV medications to treat coronavirus patients as an increase in the number of cases poses a growing threat to the economy and public health, the government’s top spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nThe government is making “preparations so that clinical trials using HIV medication on the novel coronavirus can start as soon as possible,” Yoshihide Suga told a briefing, but added he could not say how long it might take to approve a drug’s use.\n\nA further 88 people tested positive for the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the port of Yokohama, bringing the total number of infected passengers to 542, the Health Ministry said.\n\nElsewhere, three more cases were diagnosed in Wakayama Prefecture, including the son of a doctor infected with the virus, local media said. As the contracting economy deepens recession fears, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to curb the size of public gatherings, while some companies are telling employees to work from home.\n\nHIV drugs have been touted as a potential cure for the coronavirus, which has killed almost 1,900 people in mainland China. No therapy has yet proven fully effective against the infection. People in China have begun exploring unorthodox ways to get treated, with some appealing to HIV patients and unauthorised importers for medicine.\n\nIn Thailand, doctors said they appeared to have had some success in treating severe cases of the virus with a combination of medications for flu and HIV.\n\nAs demand for surgical masks surges in Japan, police were investigating the theft of 6,000 masks reported by the Kobe Red Cross Hospital in the central city, a hospital official said. Japanese officials have promised to work hard to avoid disruption to the Olympic Games starting in Tokyo in July, but concern about the virus led Mongolia’s Olympics archery team to cancel training in Japan, the Kyodo news agency said.\n\nDIAMOND PRINCESS EVACUATIONS\n\nU.S. government evacuation flights on Monday flew home more than 300 Americans who had been on board the Diamond Princess.\n\nWith more than 3,000 passengers and crew, the ship has been in quarantine since early this month, after a passenger who had left it in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. The vessel will receive meals from World Central Kitchen, a non-profit set up by celebrity chef Jose Andres, in a bid to reduce the burden on crew, said Rai Caluori, vice president of vessel operator Princess Cruises.\n\nPassengers still on the ship, about half of whom are Japanese, have expressed frustration over the quarantine and authorities in Australia, Canada, Italy and South Korea are also planning to evacuate citizens from the cruise liner. A plane chartered by the Canadian government has left for Japan to evacuate its nationals, TV Asahi said. Canada has said 14 days of quarantine await them on their return. South Korea is also sending a government charter flight on Tuesday to take home four citizens, and a Japanese spouse, who have no symptoms, a South Korean official said. Japanese who test negative will begin disembarking as early as Wednesday, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said.\n\n“Everyone wants to return home as soon as possible, so considering that feeling, we are making preparations,” Kato told reporters.\n\nDisembarkation was set for Feb. 19 to 21, Japan’s vice health minister said, according to a copy of a letter circulated on Twitter by a passenger using the handle @daxa–tw. The letter said local health authorities would take passengers’ temperatures before they left the ship.

His latest project, The National Centre for Leadership and Management, brings together the finest minds to deliver a refreshing new approach to executive education.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19: (L-R) Al Pacino, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt attend 2020 ...

The iPhone's beauty, processor speed, and UX weren't the driving force behind its success: the App Store was.\"\n\nHe's right.\n\nUber has become the world's largest taxi firm, and it doesn't own a single car. Facebook is the most successful human-made creation of all time, with more followers than Christianity assembling daily.\n\nTOKYO, JAPAN - 2019/12/18: An Uber Eats cyclist rides through Chuo-dori Avenue cross road in ...

This means that customers drive the multi-sided platforms with users being interchangeably consumers and creators, buyers and sellers, readers, and writers - prosumers, rather than consumers.\n\nPlatforms have created ecosystems where customers of a business can interact and are, therefore, more engaged than ever before. This engagement is new productivity, creating a developed efficiency and pace that fuels further commitment. \"As this gains traction, it can lead to exponential growth beyond the capabilities of traditional business models,\" says Cobb.\n\nIf the customer is now truly king, the race is on to get as close to them as possible - and to do more for them than ever before - this is driving a radical rethink of how organizations interact with their customers and how their internal management structures enable more customer proximity.\n\n\n\n\n\nA New Model for Organisations\n\nCobb has identified a revolutionary new model for customer engagement. And just as the Japanese management techniques of Kaizen and Six Sigma were successfully adopted by leadership practices in all sectors, he predicts that platform principles, initially led by Silicon Valley and the 4th industrial revolution, will be adopted by different types of organizations across the economy.\n\nOne best practice example he's observed lies within the most significant white goods manufacturer in the world, Haier Group, from Qingdao in China. In 2016, they took over General Electric Appliances (GEA). So, how does a Chinese company translate its pioneering thinking to the western world? And what does such transformation look like?\n\nTATARSTAN, RUSSIA - AUGUST 28, 2019: Igor Komarov, Presidential Envoy to Russia's Volga Federal ...

Sales are up 11%, despite a market decline of 1%. Why? Because they've embraced and innovated the platform model.\n\nHaier produces a 'smart' refrigerator, which scans your products as you place them in. It's cool; it can recommend recipes, suggest shopping lists, and inform you when you're running low - all via a mobil app. When you order your new smart fridge, you are entirely in control of its specifications. You can speak directly to the assembly engineer via video call to make any changes in the specification as your product is being assembled and programmed. Haier's CEO, Ruimin Zhang, has conceived this model - he calls rendanheyi, meaning 'zero distance to the customer'.\n\nTATARSTAN, RUSSIA - AUGUST 28, 2019: Producing washing machine drums at the Haier plant in ...

Using this model, Haier has created a 'connected' strategy of customer-employee-organization interactions. It's an ecosystem, and Haier is the platform supporting more than 1.6 million people within it. This type of 'connected' strategy transforms traditional episodic customer interactions into connected customer relationships that are characterized by continuous, low-friction, and personalized communications. These interactions enable instant feedback and challenge from customers, and provide stronger sense of purpose and satisfaction to employees, creating radical autonomy and a feeling they're running a 'business within the business.'\n\n\n\n\n\nA New Model for Leaders\n\nThis dynamic changes the relationship between an organization and employee posits Cobb, \"for if the employee owns the relationship with the customer, what is the role of the wider organization?\"\n\nThe challenge is to become an enabler and a catalyst of the network between customer-employee-organization, providing an ecosystem for positive engagements - a 'platform' if you will.\n\nBut what is the new challenge for leaders and managers?\n\nWhat are the opportunities?\n\nWhat are the dangers?\n\nIf employees take total accountability for interactions with their customers, how do you engender trust, collaboration, and cooperation within teams?\n\nAnd lastly, how do you build a positive employer brand? For talent will shop around for the best central services.\n\nCobb provides a universal answer. \"Servant leadership is back in fashion - for good reason,\" he says. \"It's often misconstrued as being soft or idealistic - that is far from the case. It's actually about inverting the pyramid of importance and status within an organization so that everything is focused on supporting customer-facing teams and so, the customer. It's a much more effective model for leading the types of organizations that win in the new economy.\"\n\nIt is a concept that fosters collaborative working, supplants individualism and supports collectivism, and enables autonomy towards a common purpose.\n\nMany have argued that 'service leadership' is a more appropriate term because servant leadership, when applied throughout an organization, creates a 'service culture.'\n\nOf course, \"the antithesis of a service culture is command and control, which is typically characterized by pyramidal org charts, line management, layers of authority, and traditional, rigid pathways of progression and reward.\" Thus, organizations still operating this model are becoming increasingly noncompetitive in the war for talent as a new generation of customers and employees, natives of the platform revolution, emerges."

            "content": "Last week ended with the gloomy news that India ’s merchandise exports fell for the sixth straight month. It reiterates the fact that the role of exports in economic growth is declining. This trend has also slowed down the pace at which the economy is growing.Prevailing economic wisdom is that a country is unlikely to become prosperous without exports playing an important role. The typical remedy for India’s current situation has been to look for best practices of East Asian countries, trailblazers in the export-led growth approach. We may be better off looking closer east: at Bangladesh Bangladesh and Vietnam are the newer examples of low income countries using exports to propel their economy. Bangladesh in the last couple of decades has emerged as a key hub for apparel exports. To put this in context, about three decades ago its exports of footwear and apparel accounted for less than 1% of the global exports in these products. Now, it’s about 7%, behind only China and Vietnam. These sectors employ about 3.6 million people, of whom over half are women.Bangladesh’s success in this area has over the last five years helped it register a steady increase in the speed at which its economy has been growing, from about 6.5% to 8%. The country, on average, outperforms its Asian peers.The salience of the Bangladesh story comes from a regressive recent policy trend in India. Over the last three years, the Narendra Modi government has gone back to a trade policy characterised by protectionism, reversing an approach that took root in 1991. Prior to the regression into protectionism, India often unilaterally reduced import tariffs and exports were an important contributor to that period of fast-paced economic growth.A reversion to protectionism is counterproductive because it diminishes India’s chances to integrate more tightly into global value chains (GVCs). GVCs are the most important development in cross-border trade over the last three decades. They arose as a combination of technological improvements and worldwide reduction in tariffs made it viable for big firms to split their production process across countries. A lot of trade in products is really within different arms of the same corporation as the inputs are made in one country and the final product assembled elsewhere.Bangladesh has used the GVC phenomenon well to quickly expand its export of readymade garments. For a poor country with a large pool of low skilled workers, GVCs offer a quick path to transition from exporting largely commodities to basic manufactured products. The lessons that India needs to absorb are that GVCs work well when imported inputs are made cheaper by lower tariffs. This of course has to be supplemented by smart and targeted government intervention. Lower tariffs on their own will not work.Bangladesh’s interventions in areas such as reduction in the cost of working capital for firms have played an important role in getting its garment sector more tightly integrated into GVCs. This is not something that the Indian government is unaware of. The finance ministry’s most recent Economic Survey devotes a lot of space to suggesting ways to integrate Indian firms into GVCs. Apparently, the government’s economic advisers and decision makers are not on the same wavelength.Two other important lessons that Bangladesh offers are significant. One, it is not averse to trade agreements. India, on the other hand, is now wary of regional trade agreements at a time when WTO is increasingly ineffective. Trade agreements play an important role in creating a conducive environment for linking local firms to international ones. The presence of foreign firms encourages domestic firms to raise their quality and look for new opportunities.Two, Bangladesh has managed to keep its labour costs in line with its per capita income. This is important to generate opportunities for low skilled workers as labour costs matter in investment decisions of basic manufactured products. India hasn’t fared well in this area, with a poor regulatory framework playing a part.The world today is more hostile to cross-border trade than it was 15 years ago. Yet, opportunities persist for countries willing to tailor their policies to grab them. One source of opportunities is the uneasy trade relation between the US and China. They may have recently called a truce in their trade war but underlying problems remain. China aspires to be a strategic competitor to the US, which will induce many corporations to shift some their production lines out of the former. India should look to grab these opportunities.A low income country such as Bangladesh offers relevant lessons to design the set of changes needed to attract more GVCs to India. In popular imagination, Bangladesh may be a basket case, still sending economic migrants into India. This view masks the changes there.It’s almost 50 years since Bangladesh achieved liberation, with India’s help, after a bloody war with Pakistan. Not many gave the country a chance. Not only has it recorded considerable progress in economic and social indicators, it has left Pakistan behind in important areas such as per capita GDP. If the economic growth rates of India and Bangladesh diverge for a few more years, Bangladesh will surpass India in per capita GDP terms.For sure, success in apparel exports have not overcome other problems. Bangladesh has a weak financial system, with banks burdened by stressed loans which amount to almost 9% of GDP. There is overdependence on apparel exports and a skills deficit. Yet, Bangladesh’s policies offer some lessons for India and it will be our loss to ignore them."

The local market has long been flooded by low-cost Chinese goods. Traders fear that if the outbreak and quarantine efforts continue they will have to switch to more expensive alternatives, passing higher prices onto consumers who may not be able to bear them. (AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed)\n\nHEBRON, West Bank (AP) — The West Bank city of Hebron is separated from the epicenter of China's virus outbreak by more than 4,000 miles and a ring of Israeli checkpoints. But even here the economic symptoms of the outbreak are starting to appear.\n\nPalestinian markets have long been flooded by low-cost Chinese goods. Traders in Hebron, the largest Palestinian city and a commercial hub for the territories, fear that if the outbreak and quarantine efforts continue they will have to switch to more expensive alternatives, passing higher prices on to consumers in an already weakened economy.\n\nTheir concerns point to the potential for wide-ranging ripple effects from the outbreak in China, the world's largest exporter. The health crisis has already thrown the global travel industry into chaos and threatened to disrupt supply chains around the world that depend on China. That a city deep inside the Israeli-occupied West Bank is so reliant on Chinese goods illustrates the perils of global economic integration.\n\nThe illness, recently named COVID-19, first emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Since then, the virus — a new type of coronavirus — has spread to about two dozen countries and infected more than 73,000 people. It has caused more than 1,800 deaths, nearly all in China. No cases have yet been identified in Israel or the Palestinian territories, but merchants have felt the impact and fear the worst is yet to come.\n\nSamer Abu Eisha, a children's clothes wholesaler in Hebron, has been importing from China for more than two decades. He has a permit from Israel that allows him to fly from Ben Gurion International Airport to China's Guangzhou province every two months so he can place orders with factories there and supervise output.\n\nBut business ground to a halt last month as the outbreak gathered pace. Israel and neighboring Jordan have suspended all flights to China, shipments have been put on hold, and Abu Eisha says his agent in China is confined to his home because of a local quarantine.\n\nIf the situation continues he'll have to explore other options. The effects will vary from business to business, with some already feeling the pinch and others preparing to switch up supply lines — and raise prices — in the coming months.\n\n“There is an alternative in Turkey, but it’s not the same. It’s not the same quality or the same workmanship or the same price,\" he said. \"It’s hard because all the raw materials also come from China, so things will be more expensive.”\n\nHe estimates he'll have to raise prices by up to 30%, which could pose difficulties in the local market. Decades of Israeli restrictions have hindered economic development in the West Bank, leaving many Palestinians reliant on low-cost imports.\n\n“The economy here is terrible. In Palestine it’s zero, or less than zero,” Abu Eisha said.\n\nBilal Dwaik, another Hebron merchant who imports women's clothing from China, was supposed to travel there later this month but had to cancel his trip because of the outbreak. He says if it continues the effects will be felt across the region.\n\n“The economies of the whole Arab world are not productive, they aren’t self-sufficient,\" he said. \"It’s all dependent on imported goods, on Chinese goods.”\n\nPalestinian traders began flocking to China in the 1990s after the Oslo accords with Israel allowed the newly created Palestinian Authority to pursue an independent trade policy.\n\nMore than $33 million of Chinese goods were imported in 1998. A decade later that figure had quadrupled, and in 2018 total imports from China reached $425 million, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.\n\nThe imports have taken a heavy toll on local manufacturers, especially Hebron's famous shoemaking industry, which even produced boots for the Israeli army until the military switched to a U.S. supplier a few years back.\n\nAbdo Idrees, the head of Hebron's Chamber of Commerce, says the number of factory workers making shoes has plummeted from 35,000 in the mid-1990s to fewer than 8,000 today.\n\n“The world is intertwined,” Idrees said. “The entire world is relying on China and no alternative has emerged.”\n\nShifa Abu Saadeh, the general director of the Palestinian Economy Ministry, says some 700 factories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were shuttered in the 1990s alone. The Palestinian Authority has tried to stem the tide by imposing tariffs of up to 35% on imported goods, but competitively priced Chinese imports still fill local shelves.\n\nStory continues"

The opposition party took a jibe at the 'Gujarat model' development, accusing the BJP government in the state of trying to \"hide poverty\" by constructing a wall in Ahmedabad ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit there later this month.\n\n\"We live in times where: GDP is measured in tons, Citizen rights in volts, Nationalism in decibels, Poverty in height and length of the wall. This is BJP's 'New India'!,\" Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter.\n\nCongress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said playing 'hide and seek' has become the favourite game of the BJP government as it was concealing data pertaining to GDP numbers, inflation, unemployment and \"now lowest ever consumption\".\n\n\"Favourite game of the BJP government is hide and seek. Hide farmer suicide statistics. Hide unemployment figures. Hide the truth of demonetisation. Hide real GDP figures. Hide poverty behind the 'wall'. And now hide the lowest consumption in 40 years,\" he said, adding the government has \"launched a war\" against all sections of society including women, students and farmers.\n\nVallabh alleged that 16 out of 23 sectors in manufacturing are in poor condition, but the government continues to be in a denial mode. \"We ask the government that data should not be hidden, but made public so it can be discussed as India is capable of battling all odds,\" he said.\n\n\"Those talking about the Gujarat model are now building walls to hide the poverty there. If a disease is to be treated, you have to accept that it is there in the first place. But BJP does not accept its failures,\" he said while taking a dig at the BJP government over reports of construction of a wall in Ahmedabad to allegedly hide a slum in Ahmedabad.\n\nThe Congress leader said the country has had the lowest growth in last nine years and this will definitely reduce savings as well, because inflation currently stands at 7.95 per cent. \"BJP's favourite rating agency Moody's has projected India's growth estimate for 2020 to be 5.4 per cent, against the government's claim of showing 6 to 6.5 per cent growth in the year,\" he said.\n\nVallabh said poverty increases when consumption is low and claimed that UNDP data for 2005-2015 showed that during the period, the highest eradication of poverty (271 million people) had taken place in the country and the credit for this goes to MNREGA.\n\nGet the best of News18 delivered to your inbox - subscribe to News18 Daybreak.

            "content": "Toyota’s Super Secret Plan To Rule The World With Hybrid Cars\n\nFebruary 17th, 2020 by Steve Hanley\n\nAlmost four years ago, Tesla announced its Secret Master Plan, Part Deux. Here it is in its entirety:\n\nCreate a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price Use that money to create an affordable, high volume car\n\nAnd… Provide solar power. No kidding, this has literally been on our website for 10 years.\n\nAs plans go, this has been a pretty good one. Right now there’s a better than even chance Tesla could be the sole manufacturer of every car sold in the world within 20 years!\n\nToyota may be the largest car company on the planet, depending on how you measure such things — most cars sold, highest corporate profits, or number of executive washrooms in its corporate offices — but Toyota seems to be deliberately dismissing the electric car revolution spearhead by Elon Musk and his minions. Instead, it is focusing on hybrid powertrains and hydrogen fuel cells. Are its top executives clueless, delusional, or just plain ignorant?\n\nLast week, Larry Hutchinson, president and CEO of Toyota Canada, gave a speech during the opening ceremonies for this year’s Canadian International Auto Show. That speech was summarized and reprinted by David Booth, who has been an automotive correspondent for Driving, a Canadian website, for the past 20 years.\n\nHutchinson acknowledges that the world is suffering from an overabundance of carbon emissions (many of them created by the millions upon millions of Toyota vehicles on the road worldwide). He notes that sales of battery electric cars in Canada have collapsed as government incentives have expired. He told his audience:\n\nHere’s the reality: In order to achieve carbon reduction with a costly single technology, you have to incentivize that technology into the marketplace. No matter how motivated the consumer, there is a price point or premium beyond which people will not opt for the cleaner product because the payback is intangible, and it often requires compromises in comfort and convenience.\n\nBEVs are expensive. So, to encourage their adoption, governments have had to offer significant financial incentives to would-be buyers. We’d also need to build expensive infrastructure to support that technology. So, there are enormous up-front capital costs that have to be paid by somebody. And so far, we’ve seen consumers alone are not prepared to pay those costs. The bottom line is this: To have any impact with a zero-emission vehicle mandate, the cost to government would be extremely high. And sadly, we’d still miss our overall carbon reduction targets.\n\nThere is a solution to this conundrum, of course, and the solution is the one Toyota has been trumpeting for the past 15 years — hybrid power. Here’s the meat of his remarks.\n\nThe average battery capacity in a BEV is about 60 kWh. The average battery capacity in a Toyota hybrid is 1.4 kWh. In practical terms, that means you could build 42 Priuses in place of the 60 kWh battery in one BEV. Forty-two Priuses — each reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent — would have the impact of 12 ZEVs. So, the question is this: For the same resources — the same total number of battery cells — do you want the GHG reduction of one car? Or 12? And that’s 12 vehicles without range anxiety, government incentives, or even any infrastructure investment.\n\nToyota continues to make hybrid powertrains available in more models, including in its Lexus luxury division. It recently introduced the hybrid RAV4 compact SUV, which could certainly surprise quite a few owners with its 219 horsepower and combined fuel economy of 40 miles per gallon. There are precious few other SUVs on the road that squeeze that many miles out of a gallon of gasoline. It even has a 1,750 pound tow rating, something many battery electric cars lack.\n\n“Governments have their environmental goals. So does Toyota. The government has a carbon reduction objective: 30 per cent by 2030. Toyota wants to get there, too. In fact, we want to go further. And we have a solid, practical plan to get there,” Hutchinson says, although careful readers will note the company has sided with the current US administration in its quest to roll back gas mileage standards to the 90s. If that strikes you as Toyota talking out of both sides of its corporate mouth, you’re not wrong. Toyota is promoting an “all of the above” scenario similar to what nuclear, coal, and natural gas advocates propose for the electricity generation industry.\n\nIf governments want to speed up the adoption of electrified vehicles, we need a comprehensive, long-term strategy geared toward overall carbon reduction. One that includes a variety of technology options and encourages consumers to make choices that drive meaningful reductions in carbon emissions across the entire fleet of vehicles on Canadian roads, not just a few niche vehicles. And, if we want to move sales of advanced technology vehicles beyond their natural demand curve, there is definitely a role for government incentives but they should be technology neutral. In other words, [governments] should incentivize emissions reduction — not specific technologies.\n\nDone properly, zero emissions vehicles would then naturally enter the market, but would also join a much larger fleet of low and near zero emissions vehicles, each of which is doing its share of the heavy lifting.\n\nHere’s the punchline of Hutchinson’s presentation:\n\nIn short, our message to government is this: Set the goal posts, but don’t call the play. Because we automakers know best how to drive down costs and get competitive [low-emissions] vehicles into the market.\n\nIf memory serves, the US government did precisely that. It set the goal posts in 2015 and 2016. Then Toyota and several other major car companies cried foul and begged the new government to save them from the very standards they agreed to. Hutchinson’s argument makes some sense, but it is hard to trust anything he or Toyota says.\n\nAnd here’s something he should consider. Any EV, with its quiet, powerful ride, is far more pleasant to drive than any hybrid vehicle Toyota makes with its gasoline engines cutting in and out incessantly and the roar of its low tech continuously variable transmission filling the passenger cabin whenever the driver whistles down to the engine room for more power. (I owned a Prius for 3 years. I know whereof I speak.) When Toyota makes a hybrid that is as smooth and silent as a battery electric car, then and only then can it truly say it is offering consumers choices that are as good or better than an electric car.\n\n\n\nFollow CleanTechnica on Google News.\n\nIt will make you happy & help you live in peace for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
