            "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coronavirus has halted may global deliveries\n\nGlobalisation has been one of the buzzwords of the past 25 years.\n\nIt may seem a rather strange concept, since any economic historian will tell you that people have been trading across vast distances for centuries, if not millennia.\n\nYou only have to look at the medieval spice trade, or the East India Company, to know that. But globalisation is really about the scale and speed of international business, which has exploded in the past few decades to unprecedented levels.\n\nEasier travel, the world wide web, the end of the Cold War, trade deals, and new, rapidly developing economies, have all combined to create a system that is much more dependent now on what is happening on the other side of the world than it ever was.\n\nWhich is why the spread of coronavirus, or Covid-19 to be specific, has had such an immediate economic effect.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Car factories around the world have stopped production\n\nProfessor Beata Javorcik, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, says that the pace of change in the global economy over just the past 17 years has been profound.\n\n\"When we look back at 2003, at the Sars epidemic, China accounted for 4% of global output,\" she says. \"Now China accounts for four times as much, 16%. So that means that whatever is happening in China affects the world to a much larger extent.\"\n\nGlobalisation helps to explain while nearly every major car plant in the UK has shut down - they are dependent on sales and components from around the world. When both collapsed, they just stopped making cars.\n\nChina's wealth and health therefore matter to us all far more than they used to, but this is not just a matter of scale - there is also a deeper problem with globalisation.\n\nIan Goldin, professor of globalisation and development at Oxford University, and author of \"The Butterfly Defect, How Globalization Creates Systemic Risks, And What To Do About It\", says that \"risks have been allowed to fester, they are the underbelly of globalisation\".\n\nThat, he says, can be seen not only in this crisis, but also in the credit crunch and banking crisis of 2008, and the vulnerability of the internet to cyber-attacks. The new global economic system brings huge benefits, but also huge risks.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Will 3D printing make it possible to manufacture things closer to where they will be used?\n\nWhile it has helped raise incomes, rapidly develop economies and lift millions out of poverty; that has come at the increased risk of contagion, be it financial or medical.\n\nSo what does this latest crisis mean for globalisation?\n\nFor Prof Richard Portes, professor of economics at London Business School, it seems obvious that things will have to change, because firms and people have now realised what risks they had been taking.\n\n\"Look at trade,\" he explains. \"Once supply chains were disrupted [by coronavirus], people started looking for alternative suppliers at home, even if they were more expensive.\n\n\"If people find domestic suppliers, they will stick with them… because of those perceived risks.\"\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\nProfessor Javorcik agrees, and believes a combination of factors will mean Western manufacturing industry will start bringing work back home, or re-shoring it as it is called.\n\n\"I think that the trade war [mainly between the US and China], combined with the Coronavirus epidemic, will lead companies to actually take re-shoring seriously,\" she says.\n\n\"They will re-shore activities that can be automated, because re-shoring brings certainty. You do not have to worry about your national trade policy, and it also gives you an opportunity to diversify your supplier base.\"\n\nHowever, this is not all good news for Western economies, which may now believe they have become too dependent on globalisation. Instead this cuts both ways.\n\nA great deal of globalisation is not about moving manufactured goods around the world, but moving people, ideas and information; something that we in the UK and other Western economies are very good at.\n\nAs David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy, points out: \"The service sector must have fallen off a cliff, and just look [in particular] at tourism and universities.\n\n\"There must be real concern about the number of new entries to Western universities this autumn. This is a huge export industry… many universities are dependent on Chinese students, for example.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Many universities in the West would miss overseas students, who often have to pay more for their courses, and are a key income stream\n\nThe idea that globalisation is just about moving manufacturing or supply chains to cheaper Asian countries is too simple. It has also led to massive increases in foreign students willing to pay to study at our colleges and universities, and a huge influx of wealthy tourists who want to spend money here, to name just two service sector businesses.\n\nSlowing or even reversing globalisation would hit those industries very hard indeed. But even so, Prof Goldin thinks that this pandemic marks a sea change and that \"2019 was the year of peak supply chain fragmentation\".\n\nAlthough, some factors such as 3D printing, automation, the demand for customisation, and quick delivery, as well as protectionism were already being felt; it seems that Covid-19 can only accelerate that process.\n\nThe real concern is, however, not whether these changes happen, but how far they go, and how they will be managed?\n\nProf Goldin has a simple and clear way of explaining the options - will the result be more like what happened after World War One, or after World War Two?\n\nWe could, like after 1918, get weak or weaker international organisations, the rise of nationalism, protectionism and economic depression. Or, as followed 1945, more cooperation and internationalism, like Bretton Woods, the Marshall Plan, the UN and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There was much optimism that the world would become a better place after World War Two, with the Bretton Woods conference, pictured, aiming to ensure a fairer economic order\n\nProf Goldin remains cheerful, but worries about who is going to take the lead. \"We can be optimistic, but we are not seeing leadership out of the White House certainly,\" he says. \"China can't step up to the plate, and Great Britain cannot lead in Europe.\"\n\nThis is a worry shared by Prof Portes, who points out that: \"The London G20 Summit of 2009 agreed a $1tn (£800bn) package of international cooperation, even Germany joined in. But now there is no leadership in the G20, and the USA is absent from the international scene.\"\n\nWill globalisation be reversed? Probably not, it is too important an economic development for that to happen, but it could well be slowed down.\n\nThe bigger question is, however, have we learnt the lessons of this crisis? Will we learn to spot, control and regulate the risks that seem to be an integral part of globalisation? Because the cooperation and leadership necessary to make that happen seem to be in short supply."

            "content": "A European coalition of techies and scientists drawn from at least eight countries, and led by Germany’s Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute for telecoms (HHI), is working on contacts-tracing proximity technology for COVID-19 that’s designed to comply with the region’s strict privacy rules — officially unveiling the effort today.\n\nChina-style individual-level location-tracking of people by states via their smartphones even for a public health purpose is hard to imagine in Europe — which has a long history of legal protection for individual privacy. However the coronavirus pandemic is applying pressure to the region’s data protection model, as governments turn to data and mobile technologies to seek help with tracking the spread of the virus, supporting their public health response and mitigating wider social and economic impacts.\n\nScores of apps are popping up across Europe aimed at attacking coronavirus from different angles. European privacy not-for-profit, noyb, is keeping an updated list of approaches, both led by governments and private sector projects, to use personal data to combat SARS-CoV-2 — with examples so far including contacts tracing, lockdown or quarantine enforcement and COVID-19 self-assessment.\n\nThe efficacy of such apps is unclear — but the demand for tech and data to fuel such efforts is coming from all over the place.\n\nIn the UK the government has been quick to call in tech giants, including Google, Microsoft and Palantir, to help the National Health Service determine where resources need to be sent during the pandemic. While the European Commission has been leaning on regional telcos to hand over user location data to carry out coronavirus tracking — albeit in aggregated and anonymized form.\n\nThe newly unveiled Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) project is a response to the coronavirus pandemic generating a huge spike in demand for citizens’ data that’s intended to offer not just an another app — but what’s described as “a fully privacy-preserving approach” to COVID-19 contacts tracing.\n\nThe core idea is to leverage smartphone technology to help disrupt the next wave of infections by notifying individuals who have come into close contact with an infected person — via the proxy of their smartphones having been near enough to carry out a Bluetooth handshake. So far so standard. But the coalition behind the effort wants to steer developments in such a way that the EU response to COVID-19 doesn’t drift towards China-style state surveillance of citizens.\n\nWhile, for the moment, strict quarantine measures remain in place across much of Europe there may be less imperative for governments to rip up the best practice rulebook to intrude on citizens’ privacy, given the majority of people are locked down at home. But the looming question is what happens when restrictions on daily life are lifted?\n\nContacts tracing — as a way to offer a chance for interventions that can break any new infection chains — is being touted as a key component of preventing a second wave of coronavirus infections by some, with examples such as Singapore’s TraceTogether app being eyed up by regional lawmakers.\n\nSingapore does appear to have had some success in keeping a second wave of infections from turning into a major outbreak, via an aggressive testing and contacts-tracing regime. But what a small island city-state with a population of less than 6M can do vs a trading bloc of 27 different nations whose collective population exceeds 500M doesn’t necessarily seem immediately comparable.\n\nEurope isn’t going to have a single coronavirus tracing app. It’s already got a patchwork. Hence the people behind PEPP-PT offering a set of “standards, technology, and services” to countries and developers to plug into to get a standardized COVID-19 contacts-tracing approach up and running across the bloc.\n\nThe other very European flavored piece here is privacy — and privacy law. “Enforcement of data protection, anonymization, GDPR [the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation] compliance, and security” are baked in, is the top-line claim.\n\n“PEPP-PR was explicitly created to adhere to strong European privacy and data protection laws and principles,” the group writes in an online manifesto. “The idea is to make the technology available to as many countries, managers of infectious disease responses, and developers as quickly and as easily as possible.\n\n“The technical mechanisms and standards provided by PEPP-PT fully protect privacy and leverage the possibilities and features of digital technology to maximize speed and real-time capability of any national pandemic response.”\n\nHans-Christian Boos, one of the project’s co-initiators — and the founder of an AI company called Arago –discussed the initiative with German newspaper Der Spiegel, telling it: “We collect no location data, no movement profiles, no contact information and no identifiable features of the end devices.”\n\nThe newspaper reports PEPP-PT’s approach means apps aligning to this standard would generate only temporary IDs — to avoid individuals being identified. Two or more smartphones running an app that uses the tech and has Bluetooth enabled when they come into proximity would exchange their respective IDs — saving them locally on the device in an encrypted form, according to the report.\n\nDer Spiegel writes that should a user of the app subsequently be diagnosed with coronavirus their doctor would be able to ask them to transfer the contact list to a central server. The doctor would then be able to use the system to warn affected IDs they have had contact with a person who has since been diagnosed with the virus — meaning those at risk individuals could be proactively tested and/or self-isolate.\n\nOn its website PEPP-PT explains the approach thus:\n\nMode 1\n\nIf a user is not tested or has tested negative, the anonymous proximity history remains encrypted on the user’s phone and cannot be viewed or transmitted by anybody. At any point in time, only the proximity history that could be relevant for virus transmission is saved, and earlier history is continuously deleted. Mode 2\n\nIf the user of phone A has been confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, the health authorities will contact user A and provide a TAN code to the user that ensures potential malware cannot inject incorrect infection information into the PEPP-PT system. The user uses this TAN code to voluntarily provide information to the national trust service that permits the notification of PEPP-PT apps recorded in the proximity history and hence potentially infected. Since this history contains anonymous identifiers, neither person can be aware of the other’s identity.\n\nProviding further detail of what it envisages as “Country-dependent trust service operation”, it writes: “The anonymous IDs contain encrypted mechanisms to identify the country of each app that uses PEPP-PT. Using that information, anonymous IDs are handled in a country-specific manner.”\n\nWhile on healthcare processing is suggests: “A process for how to inform and manage exposed contacts can be defined on a country by country basis.”\n\nAmong the other features of PEPP-PT’s mechanisms the group lists in its manifesto are:\n\nBackend architecture and technology that can be deployed into local IT infrastructure and can handle hundreds of millions of devices and users per country instantly.\n\nManaging the partner network of national initiatives and providing APIs for integration of PEPP-PT features and functionalities into national health processes (test, communication, …) and national system processes (health logistics, economy logistics, …) giving many local initiatives a local backbone architecture that enforces GDPR and ensures scalability.\n\nCertification Service to test and approve local implementations to be using the PEPP-PT mechanisms as advertised and thus inheriting the privacy and security testing and approval PEPP-PT mechanisms offer.\n\nHaving a standardized approach that could be plugged into a variety of apps would allow for contacts tracing to work across borders — i.e. even if different apps are popular in different EU countries — an important consideration for the bloc, which has 27 Member States.\n\nHowever there may be questions about the robustness of the privacy protection designed into the approach — if, for example, pseudonymized data is centralized on a server that doctors can access there could be a risk of it leaking and being re-identified. And identification of individual device holders would be legally risky.\n\nEurope’s lead data regulator, the EDPS, recently made a point of tweeting to warn an MEP (and former EC digital commissioner) against the legality of applying Singapore-style Bluetooth-powered contacts tracing in the EU — writing: “Please be cautious comparing Singapore examples with European situation. Remember Singapore has a very specific legal regime on identification of device holder.”\n\nDear Mr. Commissioner, please be cautious comparing Singapoore examples with European situation. Remember Singapore has a very specific legal regime on identification of device holder. — Wojtek Wiewiorowski (@W_Wiewiorowski) March 27, 2020\n\nA spokesman for the EDPS told us it’s in contact with data protection agencies of the Member States involved in the PEPP-PT project to collect “relevant information”.\n\n“The general principles presented by EDPB on 20 March, and by EDPS on 24 March are still relevant in that context,” the spokesman added — referring to guidance issued by the privacy regulators last month in which they encouraged anonymization and aggregation should Member States want to use mobile location data for monitoring, containing or mitigating the spread of COVID-19. At least in the first instance.\n\n“When it is not possible to only process anonymous data, the ePrivacy Directive enables Member States to introduce legislative measures to safeguard public security (Art. 15),” the EDPB further noted.\n\n“If measures allowing for the processing of non-anonymised location data are introduced, a Member State is obliged to put in place adequate safeguards, such as providing individuals of electronic communication services the right to a judicial remedy.”\n\nWe reached out to the HHI with questions about the PEPP-PT project and were referred to Boos — but at the time of writing had been unable to speak to him.\n\n“The PEPP-PT system is being created by a multi-national European team,” the HHI writes in a press release about the effort. “It is an anonymous and privacy-preserving digital contact tracing approach, which is in full compliance with GDPR and can also be used when traveling between countries through an anonymous multi-country exchange mechanism. No personal data, no location, no Mac-Id of any user is stored or transmitted. PEPP-PT is designed to be incorporated in national corona mobile phone apps as a contact tracing functionality and allows for the integration into the processes of national health services. The solution is offered to be shared openly with any country, given the commitment to achieve interoperability so that the anonymous multi-country exchange mechanism remains functional.”\n\n“PEPP-PT’s international team consists of more than 130 members working across more than seven European countries and includes scientists, technologists, and experts from well-known research institutions and companies,” it adds.\n\n“The result of the team’s work will be owned by a non-profit organization so that the technology and standards are available to all. Our priorities are the well being of world citizens today and the development of tools to limit the impact of future pandemics — all while conforming to European norms and standards.”\n\nThe PEPP-PT says its technology-focused efforts are being financed through donations. Per its website, it says it’s adopted the WHO standards for such financing — to “avoid any external influence”.\n\nOf course for the effort to be useful it relies on EU citizens voluntarily downloading one of the aligned contacts tracing apps — and carrying their smartphone everywhere they go, with Bluetooth enabled.\n\nWithout substantial penetration of regional smartphones it’s questionable how much of an impact this initiative, or any contacts tracing technology, could have. Although if such tech were able to break even some infection chains people might argue it’s not wasted effort.\n\nNotably, there are signs Europeans are willing to contribute to a public healthcare cause by doing their bit digitally — such as a self-reporting COVID-19 tracking app which last week racked up 750,000 downloads in the UK in 24 hours.\n\nBut, at the same time, contacts tracing apps are facing scepticism over their ability to contribute to the fight against COVID-19. Not everyone carries a smartphone, nor knows how to download an app, for instance. There’s plenty of people who would fall outside such a digital net.\n\nMeanwhile, while there’s clearly been a big scramble across the region, at both government and grassroots level, to mobilize digital technology for a public health emergency cause there’s arguably greater imperative to direct effort and resources at scaling up coronavirus testing programs — an area where most European countries continue to lag.\n\nGermany — where some of the key backers of the PEPP-PT are from — being the most notable exception."

            "content": "Around the world an unexpected impact of the economic shuttering due to the coronavirus outbreak is striking blue skies and clear water in places, from Venice to Beijing, Los Angeles to Bangalore, where only weeks ago pollution dominated.\n\nCOVID-19 has driven the global economy to a near-halt as the pandemic sweeps the globe. With factories shuttered and cars parked in garages, air pollution has dissipated in cities. The Chinese capital Beijing, known for the lung-choking levels of toxic pollution that shroud the city, has had the unusual sight of clear skies as factories in the region have shut down production. Given China’s huge problems with air pollution, which causes an estimated 1 million premature deaths a year, the reduction has offered unexpected relief.\n\nBut environmental science and policy experts warn not to call this a silver lining; any sustainable reduction in emissions and pollution will need to happen in a way that doesn’t totally splinter society. And, moreover, they expect that pollution levels will return when the coronavirus ebbs—and in some cases may come back with a vengeance.\n\n“I see it and I don’t think of a silver lining,” says Wade McGillis, an associate professor of earth and environmental engineering at Columbia University. “I see it and I think: those poor people who are not moving around and sheltered in place, and their lives being ruined.”\n\nIn the short term, the change is seemingly miraculous. Satellite images from the European Space Agency show reduced levels of nitrogen dioxide, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels that causes respiratory problems, across major cities on the continent including Paris, Madrid and Rome as countries lock down and restrict travel. Cities across the U.S. have seen similar effects as Americans stay home in traffic-prone cities like Los Angeles and New York.\n\nIn China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide emissions declined by a quarter in mid-February from a few weeks earlier, according to an analysis published in Carbon Brief. Scientists recorded similar declines in other pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter in the country, which has spent years trying to clean the air in smog-choked cities. “In terms of a shift or a change that really happened overnight, this has been unprecedentedly dramatic,” says Lauri Myllyvirta, author of the Carbon Brief report and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n\nIn theory, this sharp decline in pollution and carbon emissions is a positive development for the planet and the humans who live on it. For one, air pollution contributes to millions of deaths across the globe every year, aggravating cardiovascular disease and respiratory health. Clearer air may also deliver some brief relief to those suffering from COVID-19, making it easier to breathe for patients who are struggling, though health experts say that years of exposure to pollution has likely made many people more susceptible to the disease. “The damage is already done,” said Sascha Marschang, acting secretary general of the European Public Health Alliance in a statement. “Years of breathing in dirty air from traffic fumes and other sources will have weakened the health of all those who are now embroiled in a life or death fight.”\n\nThe decline in emissions may also seem like a win for the fight against climate change. Climate scientists have warned that global carbon emissions need to peak in the coming years for the world to have even a remote chance of keeping temperatures from rising more than 1.5°C by the end of the century, a level that would likely bring a range of dramatic consequences from mass climate migration to the loss of the world’s coral reefs. As a coronavirus-related economic fallout, carbon emissions could decline in 2020. But, without a concerted effort, they’re unlikely to stay down.\n\nThe situation in China shows how quickly emissions and the related air pollution can bounce back. By the end of March, coal consumption and nitrogen dioxide pollution had returned to normal levels, according to Myllyvirta. A bigger long-term question remains: will the country use this moment to fund green stimulus measures to foster economic growth? Such a program could rapidly expand clean energy infrastructure and energy efficiency improvements even though robust support for green infrastructure will not sustain the dramatic decline in air pollution and emissions in the short-term—at least not yet.\n\nAcross the globe, policymakers will need to answer similar questions. If policymakers make a concentrated and sustained effort to decarbonize our economy, today’s clear skies give us a preview of what may come—even if it takes decades to get there.\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.

            "content": "The world has been shaken up by the coronavirus, and the global startup community is no exception. Startup Genome has issued the first installment of reports that it plans to do on how startups are being affected since the onset of COVID-19.\n\nThe company found that Chinese venture capital deals fell 50 to 57 percentage points in the first two months of the year, since the onset of the crisis, relative to the rest of the world. If a drop like that happens globally, even for just two months, approximately $28 billion in startup investment will go missing in 2020, with a dramatic impact on companies, based on extrapolations of data collected by Pitchbook and Startup Genome.\n\n“As our world is shaken in the most dramatic way imaginable, it is time for our global startup community to get closer, support, and learn from each other,” said Arnobio Morelix, chief innovation officer at Startup Genome, in an email to VentureBeat. “Some of us remember the crash of 1987, the dot-com bubble burst of 2000-2001, and the 2007 financial crisis. With COVID-19, not only is the economic crisis sudden, the human impact is also horrific.”\n\nImage Credit: Startup Genome\n\nIf the drop in investments continues much further beyond two months and the COVID-19 shocks trigger an economic contraction, the previous two recessions (2000-2001 and 2007-2009) can serve as historical analogies for the current moment, Morelix said.\n\nIn those cases, the total drops in global VC investments were between 21.6% and 29.3% over 12 months — the equivalent of a decline of up to $86.4 billion in global VC investments when projected to our current context.\n\nAfter the past two recessions, global VC investments took one (2007-2008) and three (2000-2001) years to recover to pre-contraction levels. Relatedly, technology IPOs in the U.S. dropped by 90% following the last two recessions.\n\nBut crisis begets opportunity in more than one way, Startup Genome said. During the past two recessions, although fewer dollars were invested, more companies got funded, suggesting that businesses that are able to become cash efficient might become even more likely to raise money following a recession, albeit at lower valuations and lower total funds raised.\n\nImage Credit: Startup Genome\n\nIn addition, over half of Fortune 500 companies were created during a recession or bear market, and over 50 tech unicorns, collectively valued at $145.2 billion, were founded during the 2007-2009 recession years. These include Airbnb, which was created because the entrepreneurs behind it could not afford to pay rent at the time.\n\nNew and young firms are the main net job creators in the economy, and this is especially true during recessions, when older firms are net job destroyers. Recently, the U.S. saw unemployment insurance requests hit 3.3 million people in a single week: the highest such number recorded since 1967, when the Department of Labor started publishing figures on this. This need for net new jobs means the economy needs startups now even more than usual.\n\nImage Credit: Startup Genome\n\nGovernments in many places around the world are helping founders through these difficult times. Denmark, for example, is covering 75% of salaries for companies that do not cut staff, while Germany is offering to cover 60% of the new salaries for employees reduced from full to part time.\n\nStartups are laying off people\n\nImage Credit: Layoffs.fyi\n\nMeanwhile, a separate source of data comes from Roger Lee at Layoffs.fyi, which has begun tracking startups that have laid off employees. The Layoffs.fyi Coronavirus Tracker has tracked 82 startups that have laid off a total of 7,000 employees since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic on March 11. This one tracks only the verified numbers, but the rumored count is about twice as many. It’s only been three weeks so far, but the layoffs are growing week over week. The lion’s share of the startup layoffs are in the San Francisco area.\n\nImage Credit: Layoffs.fyi\n\nNick Bunker, economist at job site Indeed, said in an email, “Demand for tech workers appears to be slowing down, but is doing relatively better than the overall labor market. The trend in job postings for software development jobs titles is down 5.8% from the same time last year, as of March 27. Compare that to the trend in overall postings in the U.S., which is down 15.2% from last year’s trend.”\n\nAccording to Startup Genome, China’s industrial output already dropped 13.5% in January and February, while retail sales decreased by 20.5% year-on-year. The drop in VC total investments was even more acute, at between 50% to 57%. China saw the biggest drop in funding, followed by the rest of Asia. This is not surprising considering the importance of Chinese capital throughout Asia’s startup ecosystems and the fact the virus hit Taiwan and Korea in January.\n\nIt’s important to note that this drop in VC deals is not a seasonal dip due to the Lunar (or Chinese) New Year, Startup Genome said. The previous three years show an equal or higher number of deals in January as compared to December.\n\nNonetheless, there is reason to be optimistic about economic restarts following the shutdowns, Startup Genome said. China, the place first hit by the virus, is slowly coming back to work: offices are being used again — as we see from Startup Genome’s ecosystem partners in the country — and manufacturers like Foxconn (the maker of most of iPhones in China) announced they will be back to normal production schedules around now. Supporting this trend, LinkedIn data shows Chinese hiring slowly rebounding, though not anywhere near the previous levels.\n\nAs for the impact on the larger tech industry, Candor is keeping a list of companies that are hiring, freezing positions, or laying off people."

            "content": "The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a public health emergency. In just under three months, we have gone from distant reports of a new disease emerging in China to seeing cities locked down and health services brought to breaking point.\n\nPoliticians and healthcare leaders are in the unenviable position of having to make impossible decisions about how best to tackle this fast-moving situation. Yet they are missing the one thing that would help them the most: data. Waiting for data on people going to intensive-care units and sometimes sadly dying is like being in a war waiting for bombs to fall without radar.\n\nOne of the key pieces of information that we are lacking is a handle on how many people in the UK are infected with coronavirus and where they are living. While some patients who seek medical care or are hospitalized are being tested, there are many more people – possibly millions – with mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms who are not. And despite the promising headlines, it is unclear how soon we will have antibody tests to see who has already had the disease and is now recovered.\n\nRead: [This startup made a coronavirus knowledge graph to help doctors with diagnosis]\n\nA related problem is the symptoms themselves. The symptoms associated with COVID-19 include fever, persistent coughing, which are the classical symptoms, and also tiredness, breathlessness, loss of smell or taste, hoarseness, muscle aches, chest tightness or pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, drowsiness and confusion, and loss of appetite.\n\nBut many people only experience a selection of mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. So how are we supposed to tell who is infected with coronavirus and who is suffering from a seasonal sniffle or allergy? Some estimates suggest that 5-10% of us may have a fever at this time of year. And our failure to know the difference may lead people to unnecessarily self-isolate when they aren’t infected or inadvertently go out and spread the disease when they are.\n\nAlthough the elderly and those with certain health conditions are more likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19, there are also plenty of reports of hospitalizations and even deaths in seemingly young, otherwise healthy people. There are various theories as to why some people are more susceptible than others, such as smoking or vaping, but we still don’t understand why the virus affects some people much more than others.\n\nSymptom-monitoring app\n\nLast week, my King’s College London colleagues and I had an idea for how to provide the missing information to answer these tricky questions. We realized that we could use our Twins UK cohort – a group of 15,000 identical and non-identical twins – to understand more about how COVID-19 affects different people. We already have detailed health data about thousands of these twins, including genetic and immune profiling, their medical history and lifestyle, and their microbiome – any or all of which could affect their response to the virus.\n\nRather than sending out thousands of online or paper questionnaires, we teamed up with health data science company ZOE to develop a simple symptom-monitoring app called COVIDradar. The app was made from scratch in about four days and would normally take four months. Volunteer citizen scientists use it to report their health status daily and note the appearance of any new symptoms. Once we realized that there was nothing similar available in the UK to monitor symptoms on a population-wide level, we decided to make the app freely available to all.\n\nThe data from the app is being made available every day to policymakers, NHS services, and academic researchers on a strictly non-commercial basis. As well as helping us understand more about the symptoms of coronavirus and the people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill, this information will also reveal how fast the disease is spreading and identify geographical hotspots.\n\nBy getting real-time updates, decision-makers can plan and allocate limited NHS resources more efficiently and monitor the impact of policy measures, such as social distancing. The data can also help to highlight who needs testing for current or past coronavirus infection.\n\nThe response has been staggering. So far nearly two million people have downloaded the COVIDradar app and started to track their daily health, and we hope that many more will join them. The app will be in the US imminently and we hope in other countries, too, if we get support.\n\nSo far, we have already shared data from the first million participants with the NHS, revealing a wide distribution of reported symptoms all over the UK (see map), and we’ll be providing regular updates through the COVIDradar website.\n\nWe’re going to need all the help we can get over the coming weeks and months as we battle this new enemy that threatens our health and economy. While our heroic NHS staff and key workers keep the country running, the rest of us can join the fight from the safety of our homes, armed with nothing more than a smartphone. Let’s spread the app faster than the virus.\n\nTo download the app, go to COVIDradar.org or covid.joinzoe.com and follow the links to the Apple App Store or Google Play.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation by Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology, King’s College London under a Creative Commons license.

            "content": "In Sihanoukville, a Chinese-funded gambling enclave in Cambodia, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda has convinced expatriates that their investments in the local casino culture – on a double-hold amid recent Chinese coronavirus travel restrictions and an online gambling ban at the end of last year – will bounce back, Reuters revealed on Monday.\n\nChinese casino owner Kang Qiang feels so confident in Sihanoukville’s future beyond the pandemic that he told Reuters he proudly installed gold urinals in his casino recently as quirky harbingers of China’s economic resilience in the coming months.\n\nKang, along with other Chinese expatriate investors like him, is betting on the return of money from China to finish transforming Sihanoukville from a remote coastal town into an exclusive casino and beach resort.\n\nCambodia is a partner in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which aims to consolidate and strengthen China’s global trade power through strategic infrastructure projects planted in host nations. China has invested billions of dollars in Sihanoukville in recent years as part of its BRI. Home to Cambodia’s only deep-water port – and a potentially lucrative highway project linking the port to the mainland – Sihanoukville offers Beijing ample investment opportunity in addition to the casino culture.\n\nAs part of these BRI efforts, Beijing has worked to develop offshore oil in Sihanoukville’s deep-water port. Recently, China heralded the development of a similar endeavor in the nearby South China Sea. On March 27, Chinese state media boasted of “world record” natural gas extractions from deposits of methane hydrate in the highly contested waters.\n\nCCP dictator Xi Jinping found an ally in Cambodia’s authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who eagerly cooperates with the communist nation’s BRI initiatives. The enthusiasm flows both ways, according to Gavin Gao, a Chinese tech entrepreneur living in Sihanoukville who spoke to Reuters about the town’s prospects on Monday.\n\nHe claims Sihanoukville was an economic boomtown before the online gambling ban late last year – and the recent Chinese coronavirus travel restrictions more recently – curbed its growth, but he happily awaits its resurgence.\n\n“Sihanoukville is going at China speed … Here is China 2.0!” Gao gleefully exclaimed.\n\nChina’s Transport Minister Sun Chanthol offered a similarly positive spin on Sihanoukville’s economic slowdown. “The growth was just phenomenal, too fast! Now things are slowing down so it’s a good opportunity for us to catch up.”\n\nKang, the casino owner who installed gold urinals recently in an act of hope, also voiced his support of Chinese investment in Sihanoukville. “This city is just starting, there is a lot of potential. I love it. Sihanoukville gives you a feeling of freedom and no control.”\n\n“No control” would be a more realistic description of the situation currently in Sihanoukville. The collapse of a half-constructed, Chinese-owned building last year killed dozens and fueled resentment in the town. Thousands of poor Cambodians have been pushed out of the city as it has become prohibitively expensive, creating a potential future migrant crisis. Rising crime and flooding due to construction add to the town’s woes.\n\nThe CCP propaganda regurgitated by Sihanoukville expatriates joins a recent chorus of Chinese braggadocio lauding its “roaring” economy despite the country’s recent international fallout. China has faced criticism from several countries, including the United States, for its responsibility in spawning, spreading, and preventing the curtailment of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which continues to ravage the world’s economy and public health.\n\nThe Chinese coronavirus, originating in Wuhan, China late last year, was designated a global pandemic on March 11 by the World Health Organization (WHO). At press time Tuesday, the Chinese coronavirus was responsible for 838,061 infections 41,261 deaths worldwide."

            "content": "In January and February, as the coronavirus raged in China, the country recorded a shocking statistic—retail sales dropped 20.5% from a year ago, the first decline since records began. Now, as China feels increasingly confident that it has the pandemic under control, it’s gradually easing lockdowns and trying to get people to go out and spend money again.\n\nOne of the key ways China is incentivizing people to do so is through the use of digital coupons, which are issued by some local governments and delivered to users via third-party platforms such as payment app Alipay and WeChat pay. Residents log in to the apps to redeem the coupons, which can be used for dining, shopping, and travel for a short within a short period of time.\n\nOverall, more than 30 (link in Chinese) provinces and cities have rolled out these digital coupons. The city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province plans to issue 1.68 billion yuan ($237 million) of such coupons, while Nanjing in Jiangsu province has distributed 318 million yuan in coupons. The individual discounts are often small—Hangzhou, for example, requires citizens to purchase at least 40 yuan worth of goods to spend a 10 yuan coupon. Each Hangzhou resident is also allowed to redeem only five such coupons a week. Shenzhen, meanwhile, requires people to redeem the vouchers through lucky draws (link in Chinese).\n\nscreengrab Consumption vouchers issued by the Hangzhou government on Alipay.\n\nIn addition to the dismal retail data—which is traditionally recorded for both January and February due to the distortion effects of the Lunar New Year—other metrics are pointing to a dire economic outlook. In February, China’s car sales plunged 79% from a year earlier, the biggest-ever monthly decline. A gauge of factory activity in March unexpectedly rebounded into positive territory after an abysmal performance the previous month, but officials warned that the data should not be seen as a sign of economic stabilization.\n\nOverall, the data point to the world’s second-largest economy seeing its first contraction in quarterly GDP since 1989, when the country started releasing data comparable to today. A prominent adviser to the country’s central bank, meanwhile, has recommended that China do away with its long-standing tradition of setting a target for GDP growth this year—a political exercise that can shore up support for the Communist Party, but only when successful.\n\nOther measures the Chinese government is taking to keep its pandemic-hit economy afloat include slashing its bank loan rate by the biggest level since 2015 to make it easier for companies to borrow. It will also allow local governments to sell more infrastructure bonds, increase the country’s fiscal deficit as a share of GDP, and issue special sovereign debt. The government is also encouraging local officials to dine out as much as possible to give a boost to the restaurant industry. In January and February, sales at restaurants contracted by 43.1% from a year ago.\n\nChinese officials have for years pinpointed consumption as the most important driver for economic growth, as the country continues to try to shift away from an export- and infrastructure-driven economy. Consumer spending made up about 58% of the country’s GDP growth in 2019, compared with 52% in 2011 (link in Chinese).\n\nTo stimulate consumption, some economies, such as Hong Kong and Macau, have opted to give citizens cash handouts, rather than coupons. However, Shan Weijian, a well-known Chinese private-equity investor, argued in an interview (link in Chinese) that cash subsidies have a limited effect on spurring consumption as not all the cash will be spent, while vouchers ensure that the money is allocated to retail sectors. “Consumption vouchers act like cardiotonic agents or engine lighters,” he said. “When the engine is started, the economy will return to normal and run on its own.”"
