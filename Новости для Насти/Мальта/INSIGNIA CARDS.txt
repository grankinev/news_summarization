Many self-respecting gamers have always favored building their own custom gaming PCs. But people like me don’t have the time or skill to do it right, and that’s why Falcon Northwest exists.
Kelt Reeves started the company out of his dorm room in 1992. While rivals such as Voodoo PC and Alienware emerged and became bigger, they got acquired and subsumed into larger companies. HP disbanded Voodoo PC and kept it going as a brand. Dell bought Alienware and turned it into a mass-produced brand. But Medford, Oregon-based Falcon Northwest stayed small, and today is still has just 25 employees.
The team crafts gaming PCs, which were once the domain of high-end enthusiasts. But now these rigs are driving the PC business forward, infiltrating the mass market with high-end gaming laptops and desktops with multiple graphics cards and processors with dozens of cores.
I tried out a Falcon Northwest Talon machine. The 20th-anniversary edition features a custom insignia on the front of the machine. It has options for glass or solid metal sides. Like the first Talon two decades ago, it features a processor from Advanced Micro Devices. In my case, the machine had an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12 Core CPU. That tells you that AMD is giving Intel a run for its money for the first time in a long while in the high end of the PC market.
“These new Talons we sent out, the new 3900X, are the first new AMD review units that I think we’ve sent out in 15 years. It’s been a long time coming,” Reeves said in an interview with GamesBeat.
It also features an Nvidia GeForce GTX 2080 Super graphics card, with 32 gigabytes of G.Skill Memory, a Samsung 970 Pro 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD, an ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Hero X570 chipset motherboard, liquid cooling, an EVGA G3 750 Watt power supply, custom wiring by CableMod, Microsoft’s Windows 10 Pro software, and a (separately priced) curved Asus ROG monitor.

When it comes to building PCs, I no longer have the capability or the time. So Falcon Northwest’s Talon machine is the ideal kind of machine for me. Busy people and many parents don’t have the time to do this, even though they appreciate what a custom PC can deliver.
Each custom Talon PC has a space in front where Falcon Northwest will emblazon anything you want. They sent me a machine with the VentureBeat logo on it.
“The cases are very expensive,” Reeves said. “We’ve plated that with all 4mm aluminum, not because it was necessary, but because nobody else was doing it.”
Falcon Northwest’s liquid-cooled machine looks great and it makes you feel like you’ve got a hand-crafted one-of-a-kind machine.
“The nicest compliments we ever get are from former DIY (do-it-yourself) guys,” Reeves said. “I used to build my own system. Now I work 50 hours a week. The money is no problem, but I don’t have the time or the patience to deal with all the problems with building and supporting myself. I want somebody else to handle it.”

Besides the custom insignia and the metal or glass siding options, the machine has other ways to show itself off. Inside the case, the machine also features RGB lighting that you can configure as you wish.
Outstanding benchmark performance
The system’s benchmarks were impressive. It scored X13964 on the 3DMark 2011 benchmark, and it scored 24,214 on the 3DMark Firestrike benchmark. Both reveal how good it is at running 3D games. On the PCMark 7 benchmark, it scored a PC Mark score of 9,693, an entertainment score of 8,374, and a creativity score of 12,432. On Cinabench, it scored 3,109. Basically, yeah, that’s badass.
You can also see how it performs with the two embedded Call of Duty: Modern Warfare videos. I’ve embedded the videos so you can see how Modern Warfare looks with RTX real-time ray tracing 3D graphics.
And it looks good, too
I marveled at the imagery in Modern Warfare, with effects such as smoke, high-dynamic range with light and dark imagery on the screen at the same time, and cool effects like rippling water.
I also enjoyed seeing the waving grass in Ubisoft’s Ghost Recon: Breakpoint. I actually paused and stood in the grass for a while to soak in the effects of the wind blowing and the overall beauty of the environment. Both games really show off what the Talon can do when equipped with AMD processors and Nvidia RTX graphics.

If you look at my embedded Hunting Party video for Modern Warfare, you’ll see the multiple light sources and reflections in water in the alley scene at 2 minutes and 50 seconds. The shadows and lighting add so much to the realism of the moment. You can see similar effects throughout the level. And at 2:45 into the multiplayer video, you can see reflections on the palace floor from multiple light sources.
With the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super and even the 2060, you can play Modern Warfare at 60 frames per second, with maximum settings, at 1080p with raytracing enabled. With the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, you can get 4K resolution with raytracing, 60 FPS, and Ultra settings.

Sticker shock

The Falcon Talon has an introductory price of $2,432. But the system I tested is $4,300. That’s not cheap by any standards, and a lot of that price comes from the craftsmanship put into the desktop. That is, it’s not the performance of GPUs or CPUs alone that you’re paying for. Certainly, you are paying for that. If you throw everything in the machine, it can exceed $6,000.
But you are also paying for the custom paint job. If you care about the price, then you can obviously get something cheaper from somewhere else or by building a PC. You get a lot of coolness and panache out of that, but it’s not clear how much you should value that. Dell and HP target machines below $3000 or $2,000.
Conclusion
Image Credit: Falcon Northwest
The Falcon Northwest 20th anniversary Talon is a magnificent machine that gives you that custom gaming PC feel as well as great performance with standardized components. I tested it thoroughly on a variety of games, including Apex Legends Season 3, Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, and Modern Warfare. I had a few crashes, but nothing that suggested ongoing problems.
The special effects look both subtle and spectacular. It’s great to see your own reflection in a water puddle, and it is cool to see some extreme combat scenes with lots of characters moving around at the same time — without causing a performance hiccup. You’ll probably see new versions with new processors and graphics chip options soon.
The machine is also pretty good for productivity reasons. After all, if you’ve got a browser open with tons of open windows, all of the cores on the AMD processor will be put to work. Overall, it was a treat to play around with a machine that delivered such awesome PC gaming performance.
Score: 90/100
Disclosure: Falcon Northwest provided me with a machine for the purpose of this review. Our coverage remains objective.

Story 1
I was bitten by the audiophile bug at a relatively young age. When I was in my early teens, my parents purchased me a high-end stereo system complete with tuner, equalizer, dual cassette deck, 25-disc CD changer and massive three-way floorstanding speakers. Some 25 years later, I haven’t the foggiest why they gifted me the system as I hadn’t shown much interest in music up to that point and I know without a doubt that they couldn’t afford it. Nevertheless, I listened to it faithfully and eventually developed both a love for music and an ability to tell when something sounds good and when it doesn’t.
I never got around to exploring the ins and outs of audio equipment as console gaming, computers and photography consumed much of my free time over the past two decades. Recently, however, an opportunity to further tinker with my sound system presented itself and I couldn’t pass it up.
I recently picked up a set of the same floorstanding speakers I had as a teen. As a side project, I turned my attention to my Logitech G51 PC speakers. This was a very popular gaming speaker setup years ago when I bought it, but have been using them in a 2.1 channel configuration connected to my desktop for a while now.
The Logitech satellite speakers feature dual two-inch drivers with a maximum power output of 20 watts at 8 ohms. The subwoofer packs a 5.25-inch driver rated at 56 watts at 2 ohms. The system also includes a handy control pod for your desk to adjust master volume, subwoofer level, center and surround levels and to mute the setup. There’s even an integrated headphone and microphone jack. Logitech says that as a whole, you can expect a frequency response of 36Hz to 20kHz.
It’s your run-of-the-mill desktop speaker setup. I like it because it sounds good and the control pod is quite helpful. But like all systems, there’s room for improvement and with this article, I aim to piece together a “DIY” system to see if I can compile something that sounds even better without breaking the bank.
You'll need a few key components when assembling an audio system of this nature -- namely, a set of passive speakers, an amplifier to supply power to the speakers, and preferably -- especially if you opt for smaller bookshelf style speakers -- a subwoofer to furnish those deeper bass tones. Passive speakers simply means they don't have a built-in amp like active or powered speakers do.
It's worth emphasizing that a DIY setup is absolutely not necessary. All-in-one systems from the likes of Logitech, Creative and Bose are perfectly suitable for most people and most uses. But if you're like me -- the hobbyist type that strives for "above average," you really like music or you just can't help but traverse the next rabbit hole -- well, you'll understand.
When I purchased my home A/V receiver (a Pioneer VSX-519V) about 11 years ago, I also picked up a pair of Insignia NS-B2111 bookshelf speakers and a Polk Audio SW110 subwoofer. They were all on sale as a package deal so I figured, why not, it’ll be great for console gaming.
As it turns out, it was a bit too much for someone living in close proximity to others. Alas, I had to put the sub in storage and tune out all of the bass from the bookshelf speakers to appease the neighbors. They essentially became glorified TV speakers for the next decade.
Now that I’m in a house without neighbors living on top of me, I wanted to see what the Insignias could really do.
Unbeknownst to me until years later, the Insignia bookshelf speakers developed a bit of a cult following within the audio enthusiast community for their sound quality compared to categorically similar -- but much more expensive -- speakers. Heck, there are even guides on how to upgrade the internals for even better performance, but perhaps I'll save that for another time.
I don’t recall how much they sold for at the time but I believe the bundle with the receiver, sub and speakers was around $400 total.
Insignia has long since discontinued these speakers although you can pick up a pre-owned pair on eBay for around $70. They feature a 6.5-inch carbon fiber woofer and a 1-inch silk dome tweeter with a frequency response of 50Hz to 20kHz, sensitivity of 90 dB and maximum power handling of 120 watt at 8 ohms.
Next, I had to figure out how to power them. The logical solution would be to move the Pioneer A/V receiver from the living room to my office but that presented a few issues. The receiver would take up a huge chunk of space on my desk but as I confirmed through auditioning the floorstanding speakers, it was lacking in the power department.
I looked around for a receiver with more power but the results were disheartening. Most of the A/V receivers I found prioritized channel count over power output. Other candidates were out of my price range. And really, none of them would work well for this project as they’d consume a lot of real estate on my desk.
What I needed was a purpose-built device that was both compact and affordable. What I needed was a mini amplifier and that’s exactly what I got.
The Fosi Audio BT20A is a mini Class D power amplifier with built-in Bluetooth connectivity. It’s rated for 100W RMS x 2 and features a front-mounted power switch as well as volume, treble and bass dials. Around back, you get left and right RCA source inputs, left and right speaker outputs, a 24V power jack and an antenna for Bluetooth... all in a chassis that’s hardly any bigger than two decks of playing cards and all for less than $80.
To say that I was highly skeptical was an understatement. How this tiny box was going to supply the power I needed was beyond me and even if it could, it was probably going to sound like absolute garbage. I found solace in the nearly 375 Amazon reviews and average 4.4-star rating, however. If it stunk, I could just send it back, I told myself.
I next turned my attention to the audio source. My dated PC is equipped with a Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme card supporting a sampling rate of 96KHz and a bit depth of 24 bit. There are far better cards out there but for the purpose of this project, this card should do just fine.
Setting everything up was a simple enough affair. Using 16 gauge speaker wire, I connected the Insignias to the mini amplifier with banana plugs. A 3.5mm-to-RCA wire handled the connection between my computer and the amp. I then connected the AC adapter, plugged it into my battery backup and was off to the races.
My initial impressions were mixed.
The Fosi Audio mini amplifier absolutely blew my socks off. It has power for days and is incredibly easy to set up and use, even for someone with very little experience with audio equipment. The bass and treble dials offer basic but meaningful control over the output. I keep the amp’s volume dial at about 35 percent and adjust accordingly using the slider on the PC or the volume dial on my keyboard.
I’ve only been brave enough to turn the amp to about 45 percent with the Insignias. That’s way louder than I’d ever listen to (it’s clearly audible on the opposite side of the house) yet remains crystal clear with no distortion or clipping. Even after extended listening sessions, the amp is never more than lukewarm to the touch. I do wish it had a remote control for use in non-desk settings (like as a A/V receiver replacement) but beggars can’t be choosers.
The issue I found – and it wasn’t entirely unexpected – is that the bookshelf speakers simply don’t put out much bass.
Cranking the bass dial on the amp does have a noticeable impact but it delivers more of a light, punchy effect at mid-range settings and an artificial, undesirable sound at higher levels. Either way, it’s not the booming bass the system is needing to make it complete and that was a problem.
Fosi Audi sells a 2.1 channel amp but that doesn’t really help me as it is for passive subwoofers and supplies only 50W x 2 on the main channels – half of what the BT201A is capable of. I racked my brain but the solution was staring me in the face the whole time – the Logitech subwoofer!
The subwoofer serves as the main hub for the Logitech system. Everything plugs into – and out of – the sub. And connection is dead simple – just run a 3.5mm cable from the audio out on the sound card, connect the control pod and plug in any speakers you wish to use.
Using a 3.5mm splitter, I ran one line to the Fosi Audio amp and the other to the back of the subwoofer, except I didn’t plug in the satellite speakers. Voila! I now had the deep bass the setup was so desperately lacking. And really, it works even better than I could have anticipated as the Logitech control pod lets me dial in the bass strength and volume without having to fiddle with any settings on the back of the sub.
I’ve used a handful of computer speaker systems over the years – the infamous Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 comes to mind – but this DIY setup is by far the best. From the clarity and separation of instruments to the lack of noise in the line and the sheer power, this Frankenstein system has it all. Everything I've queued up using Amazon's new high-end streaming tier sounds excellent. I absolutely love it which is why it pains me to not be able to recommend it to others unless you happen to already own most of the components like I do.
Assuming you are starting with a blank slate, the speakers would set you back about $70, the Fosi Audio amp is roughly $80 and a respectable sound card is probably going to be about $40.
With only these components, you’re almost at $200 and that doesn’t include a bass. Presumably, a powered subwoofer could be wired up using the line-in but I’m not certain. That’s easily another $100 or more if you don’t already have one. You can buy a pretty nice desktop audio system for $300.
If you’re the type that prefers a minimalist look, something like this may not be for you. The bookshelf speakers are roughly 8.5 inches x 13.5 inches tall and take up a decent amount of space on my large desk. Worse yet, the Fosi Audio amp has a lot of unsightly wires running out the back of it and in my case, the Logitech control pod is yet another accessory consuming real estate. Fortunately, I already owned most of the necessary components and only had to come out of pocket about $80 for the mini amp.
For some, the real appeal of a setup like this is in the flexibility of it all. With a pre-configured system, you know exactly what you are - and aren't - getting. When piecing it together yourself, the sky is the limit in terms of customization as there are a near infinite number of combinations you could go with.
Should the Insignia speakers featured here not be to your liking, you could just as easily substitute them for the Polk Audio T15 bookshelf speakers ($99), the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR bookshelf speakers (also $99), Klipsch's R-15M bookshelf ($158) or the more expensive Elac Debut 2.0 B6.2s ($224.98), all of which are highly regarded. Optionally, you could grab something used via eBay or Craigslist, if you're feeling that confident.
The same can be said for the amp and subwoofer. As mentioned before, Fosi has a mini amp to accommodate passive subwoofers and even a tube-style amp that no doubt offers a different sound altogether. Or heck, if you have the room, you could even swap out the bookshelf speakers for a pair of floorstanding loudspeakers and eliminate the need for a standalone subwoofer. It all boils down to how involved you get, what you already have on hand and how much money you want to spend.
If you are in a similar boat and like tinkering with audio equipment, give it a shot. This setup is leaps and bounds better than anything else I’ve auditioned and I look forward to the smiles it’ll bring me in the future.

Story 2
The Queen was crowned in 1952, becoming the second Elizabeth to reign in the United Kingdom. However, Her Majesty’s title caused controversy in Scotland as there has never been an Elizabeth I on the throne there. This is because Elizabeth I ruled in England and died in 1603 – before the Acts of Union – and the Scottish public were so outraged at the perceived omission of Scottish history that symbols showing the new Queen’s insignia were targeted.
An explosive was even planted in a postbox in Edinburgh bearing her EIIR cypher, leading to the Scottish Crown being borne on all postboxes north of the border to this day. Eventually, the claim that the Queen should be Elizabeth I in Scotland was rejected by the courts, which found that the monarch has the Royal Prerogative to adopt any name she chooses. Another argument put forward by the Palace was that Her Majesty was the second Elizabeth to rule in territories that had now become the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, there is still some controversy over the naming of William, which could prove to be an issue when the Duke of Cambridge becomes King.
Prince William; Queen Elizabeth II
Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1952
This is because the last William to reign is still styled William IV, even though there was a prior King William in Scotland who ruled before the Union. William, King of Scots ruled from 1165 to 1214. William IV, who was on the throne from 1830 to 1837, should be considered the fifth William to rule in what had by then become the United Kingdom. When Prince William comes to the throne, then, he should actually be styled William VI to reflect Scottish history. READ MORE: Prince William's heartbreaking dilemma about Kate Middleton and Meghan

However, Charles’ name once he takes the throne has been the subject of intense discussion. Many point to the fact that Charles I was beheaded, and the various controversies of Charles II's reign, as ill omens for a new King Charles. Clarence House has always maintained that an official regnal name has not yet been chosen, appearing to scotch rumours that Charles may reign as George VII. George would be a nod to the Queen’s beloved father George VI, and also honour the bond the prince had with his grandmother.

Best Buy has quietly announced that the mobile app platform for controlling its Insignia brand of smart home devices will be shutting down on November 6th. The company says affected products will still function at a basic level, but any features that rely on its Insignia Connect app and platform will no longer work. The products include its Insignia smart wall plugs, Wi-Fi light switches, its smart camera, and its Wi-Fi freezer (yes, a Wi-Fi freezer). Best Buy is now running a reimbursement program for any unfortunate soul who decided to buy one of these products.
Perhaps most importantly, Best Buy confirms on its Connect FAQ page that its smart freezer “will retain all normal freezer functions.” There are also variants of the Insignia smart wall plug and light switch that are Apple HomeKit compatible, meaning those specific products will retain some mobile features even after the Connect shutdown next month.
Even if you’re on Android, the plug and switch won’t be entirely useless:
The Insignia Connect app functionality will not work, but any of the scheduled timers that were set up previously, will continue to function. Additionally, the button on the plug will continue to function manually as an on/off switch if needed.
Hope your timers are set right.
Best Buy is also advising any customers who use its Insignia Wi-Fi camera to download stored video clips before November 4th, two days prior to the overall Connect shutdown, or else those clips will be lost forever.
Best Buy says it’s offering reimbursement for purchasing an affected product, with e-gift cards that won’t expire, but it won’t reimburse any installation fees if, say, you paid the Geek Squad to stick some smart light switches in your walls. The company says customers can redeem up to 10 serial numbers for reimbursement through its website.
And to Best Buy’s credit, it doesn’t seem to be selling these products on its website anymore, and they show up as “Discontinued” at insigniaproducts.com. But some of them are still on sale at Amazon.
There are still some other questions. It’s not clear whether you can get fully reimbursed for having purchased a smart home Insignia product that won’t work as advertised two months from now, or just partially reimbursed. Best Buy doesn’t say on its FAQ page to what extent it's offering these refunds, and whether those refunds extend to any Insignia smart device purchase made at any point in the past, or if there is a purchase cutoff of some sort.
Best Buy says your smart fridge will keep working, thankfully
Either way, the situation isn’t ideal for those who’ve bought into the Insignia platform for their smart home needs. This type of quiet shutdown has become an expected and unfortunate trend in the smart home space. Running these platforms in-house can sound like a great, cost-saving idea at first, but doing so over months and years appears to be difficult and costly. Customers are then left hung out to dry when the platforms are inevitably shuttered.
We saw the same exact scenario play out like this earlier this year, when Lowe’s decided to stop supporting its Iris smart home platform and instead send its customers over to Samsung’s Smart Things instead. To placate customers, Lowe’s sent out Visa prepaid cards.
Google similarly decided to close its Works with Nest program in favor of migrating smart home integrations over to Google Assistant earlier this year. The outcome has been messy, to say the least, with Google forced to extend the integration support indefinitely until it can replicate every single one via Google Assistant. A number of other smart home companies have had to scramble after Google’s announcement back in May to ensure nothing would break suddenly when the August 31st deadline arrived.
Of course, putting your smart appliance eggs in a platform basket made by Best Buy is not exactly the savviest of consumer moves. But it shouldn’t be the norm that these software ecosystems are spun up with little thought into how long they’ll last, only to leave customers on the support line clamoring for their money back.

Bad news for anyone who has Insignia Connect products. On November 6, 2019, Best Buy will be shutting down its Insignia Connect platform. This means if you have an Insignia Connect appliance or device it will become decidedly less useful, and, in some cases, completely useless.
How big of an impact this makes on Insignia Connect users depends on the smart appliance or device. If you have the smart home freezer and use features that require the Insignia Connect app, those features aren’t going to work anymore. Sure, your appliance will still have basic functionality. For example, the Insignia freezer will still freeze and the display will still show the temperature, it just won’t have the “smart” features you probably bought the appliance for in the first place. The Wi-Fi Smart Plug and Smart Plug with Metering and the Wi-Fi Smart Light Switch will continue to work, but you won’t be able to change settings or schedules. Hopefully, you never have to change them. Some smart plugs will still function like normal if you have the Apple HomeKit as long as you use the HomeKit app, though. If you own the Insignia Wi-Fi Camera, on the other hand, you’re out of luck. The camera will completely cease to function and you won’t be able to access using the Insignia app after November 4, 2019.
The good news is the company is offering compensation for discontinued Insignia Connect products with e-gift cards. Best Buy states that they won’t compensate you to have the in-wall switches uninstalled from your home, though. The gift cards will probably be Best Buy gift cards, and if you don’t trust the company after this, a gift card probably isn’t the best compensation. They also don’t state how much you will be compensated or when you will receive the card on the Insignia site.
If an e-card sounds good, you can go to the Insignia Connect Product Validation Site to see if your appliances and devices qualify for compensation. You’ll need the serial number to check for eligibility. Questions about the end of the Connect line are answered on the Insignia FAQs page, or you can call their helpline at 800-568-2054 7 AM CDT to 7 PM CDT.

With over two decades of experience serving ultra-high-net-worth individuals, Insignia Group is now accelerating its US expansion in response to an evolution in UHNWI consumer preferences.
As traditional luxury items have become more accessible to the mass market, Insignia clients – especially in the US – increasingly pursue “experiential luxury.” Insignia says Exotic travel, exclusive events, and other rare, tailored experiences are rapidly replacing high-end consumer goods as the ultimate markers of status among the ultra-wealthy.
“Our clients’ world is evolving faster than ever,” says Nada Tucakov, CEO of Insignia Group. “For many of our members, purchases of super-yachts or private jets are no longer driven by the desire to own status symbols; rather, they are inspired by the opportunity to make unforgettable memories.”
According to research from Insignia America, which launched its New York lifestyle management boutique in February, the trend toward experiential luxury is especially pronounced in Western markets. Compared to UHNWIs in Russia, Asia, and the Middle East, Insignia America’s UHNWI clients tend to be relatively understated in displaying wealth.
“Among Insignia’s international client base, many of our members love the uniqueness of our payment cards, like the 14-carat gold Jewellery Card embellished with precious gemstones,” adds Tucakov. “But in Western markets, we have observed a preference for discreet plastic or virtual cards. UHNWIs in the West tend to value certain cards not because of craftsmanship or materials, but primarily because they provide a gateway to a truly distinctive lifestyle.”
However, like their international counterparts, UHNWIs in Western markets are placing ever higher value on the personal touch. “As technology becomes more prevalent in all aspects of life, human interaction is more valued than ever,” Tucakov adds. “Experiential luxury cannot exist without world-class relationships.”
To deliver the extraordinary experiences that UHNWIs value most, Insignia provides comprehensive insider access, VIP concierge services, and a dedicated, 24-hour Personal Assistant to each member. “All of our clients are different and require bespoke services,” says Richard Lewis, Managing Director of Insignia America. “But as we accelerate expansion in the US, our lifestyle management services are increasingly focused on access to exclusive events and exotic destinations.”
Insignia’s members are typically adventurous, with an appetite for cutting-edge experiences. Almost no request is impossible to fulfil – whether it is a front-row seat to a sold-out sporting event, a chartered yacht at a moment’s notice, or round-the-clock personal security anywhere in the world.
“We recently crafted a private trip for one of our clients to visit the wreckage of the RMS Titanic, off the coast of Newfoundland,” adds Lewis. “Alongside a team of researchers and scientists, our client and his guests became part of an elite group to see this historic vessel before she is consumed by the sea. More people have visited the moon than the Titanic, making this a phenomenally unique experience.”

The best shopping weekend of the year is coming right up: Amazon's long-awaited Prime Day is this weekend, and consumers and brands alike are excited. You won't have to wait until Saturday to take advantage of these deals, however — big retailers are already competing to offer consumers the best deals on everything from tech and electronics to clothing and furniture.
By now, every TV you buy should probably have a smart interface built in. Thankfully, competition and developments in technology have meant that you no longer need to shell out a fortune for Roku or Amazon's Fire TV.
If you're looking for a great deal on a smart TV, look no further than this fantastic pre-Prime Day deal on an Insignia 39-inch Fire TV. Right now, Insignia is selling its 39-inch Fire TV at a great price – this set is going for just $180, which is $50 off the regular price.
With the Fire TV experience integrated into the TV, you can enjoy all your favorite streaming content without lifting a finger. Get instant access to thousands of streaming channels, like Netflix, Prime Video and HBO using the simple, intuitive Fire TV interface, or access major streaming services, like Amazon Music and Pandora, using just your voice to control Alexa.
The Voice Remote uses Alexa technology to perform a variety of functions to make your experience easier — launch apps, switch inputs, control smart home devices and search for titles, all with just your voice. Your TV also receives automatic software updates and gets smarter the longer you have it, so you'll always have the latest and best in Alexa improvements. You can also go beyond streaming with Alexa — with Alexa tech, your TV can compete with any virtual assistant. Find restaurants, check the score or order pizza, all with your TV.
Although device input and output options are a little less exciting than all the Alexa possibilities, they're certainly important, and the makers of this TV haven't forgotten about them. This TV comes with three HDMI ports, including one with ARC, a USB port, a composite input, an antenna/cable input, a digital output, an audio output and an Ethernet port.
Pick up this 39-inch TV, the perfect set for a bedroom or a kitchen, while you can. It has a crisp 1080 picture, more than enough for a smaller screen. There's no loss of quality that comes with a smaller screen here either — Insignia's screens are built for speed and performance, so you can enjoy lifelike detail, deep contrast and vivid colors.
The Insignia TV was originally $230 but is on sale at Amazon right now for $180.

AUSTRALIANS have a love affair with big things. We have the Big Banana, the Big Pineapple and the Big Merino to name a few. Now that the 2019 BMW X7 M50d has landed, we have something else that’s big to fall in love with.
The feature packed large SUV might just be one of the hardest vehicles to ever hand the keys back for. It’s that good. Mind you it’s not quite as big as the Big Banana so that’s a little disappointing. We jest of course.
Its size will guarantee you not only stand out on the road, it’s sheer presence will have other motorists moving out of your way. The menacing grille and hexagonal BMW Laserlight LED headlights are a sight to behold in the rear-vision mirror.
Climb inside the BMW X7 and wow is the first word you’ll utter. It bombards the senses as you are met with various lighting touches, fine materials and utter space. During the day, the panoramic glass sunroof fills the cabin with natural light.
It opens up the interior to the outside world. At night, one of the main features of the big BMW SUV is light, but we’ll touch more on that later. First, to one of the key interior highlights; Crafted Clarity glass.
The artistic crystal glass is used for the gear selector, iDrive controller, Start/Stop button and the volume knob. When hit by natural or artificial light, these elements shine and sparkle, adding a level of sophistication seldom found in vehicles with a price tag of less than a quarter of a million dollars.
Rather ironically, ‘Merino’ leather is beautifully appointed throughout the interior, with supreme stitching quality that screams luxury and comfort. The seats, dashboard, door cards and the steering wheel are all adorned in this high-quality elegant leather.
As you push that glass crystal Start/Stop button however, this is where the M50d differentiates itself from the ‘base’ X7 Design Pure Excellence model.
Aside from some subtle exterior badging and ‘M’ insignia inside the cabin, once you fire the 3.0 Litre, Quad Turbo Diesel engine into life you know something is a little different.
Producing 294kW and 760Nm, the X7 M50d (if you are so inclined) will sprint from 0-100km/h in 5.4 seconds.
That’s right, this 2.4 tonne behemoth will out-perform many a hot hatch or sports saloon. And it sounds great doing it thanks to BMW’s M Sport exhaust system, making the M50d sound better than any diesel engine has the right to.
In addition to the exhaust system, BMW’s ‘M’ division have thrown in an M aerodynamics package, 8-speed Steptronic Sports transmission, M Sport Brake system and M Sport differential.
These features combined with the 22-inch BMW Individual light alloy wheels wrapped in 275/40 tyres on the front, and massive 315/35 tyres on the rear, mean the X7 M50d is surprisingly agile.
When engaged in Sports mode, the Executive Drive Pro suspension control system manages the ride and handling, thanks to active roll stabilisers, to deliver a comfortable and dynamic driving experience by reducing body movements to a minimum.
While you can trick science with power and traction in a straight line, there is a limit to how much you can control inertia and centre of gravity. It’s here you really notice the size and weight of the X7, but it is still impressive what the M50d can do given it’s mass.
Calm down and start to play around with the menus and you soon uncover some of the X7’s party pieces. Front row massage seats will have you relaxed or activated upon arrival at your destination, depending on which of the eight massage programs you choose.
Activated at the touch of a button, we don’t know how we’ve survived this long in a car without them. Also within the BMW Operating System 7.0 is the Experience Modes menu.
Depending on your mood, the X7 can vitalise or relax you by selecting one of these modes. By adjusting the ambient light, climate control, seat ventilation, sun protection and audio track, the X7 will become your personal life coach.
It’s set up to get you prepared for the next item on your agenda, or wind down after a long day. Another feature we loved was the reversing assistant, which stores the path of the last 50m of driving up to 35km/h.
It’s very handy in a vehicle this size, especially in the city where parking and maneuvering can be a nightmare. Simply select reverse, take your hands off the wheel, and control the speed as the X7 takes over and gets you in and out of tight spots. Brilliant.
Lastly for us, and definitely not least, is the night-time experience the X7 has to offer. Best experienced from the rear seats, the X7 comes to life after dark thanks to an atmosphere of ambient, indirect lighting and highlights that are a feast for the eyes.
Strategically placed LEDs, optical fibres and accents can all be adjusted through six colours to personalise an experience to your taste, that is dominated by the Panorama glass roof.
Thanks to 15,000 lighting elements in the glass roof, you travel under a blanket of brightly coloured stars that never ceases to amaze the eyes. It’s truly beautiful and has to be seen to be believed.
Priced from $184,792 drive away, the 2019 BMW X7 M50d is some $10,000 more expensive than the Audi SQ7, which is its main rival. The X7 though feels like it has that extra special edge, which the Audi can’t match.
While we can’t do the 2019 BMW X7 M50d justice entirely in this review, what we can say unequivocally though is that this is an exceptional vehicle that makes you feel special in a way many others cannot.
From the time you climb inside to the moment you park and walk away, few vehicles will leave you in amazement the way the 2019 BMW X7 M50d can.
Our test vehicle was provided by BMW Australia. To find out more about the 2019 BMW X7 M50d, contact your local BMW dealer.

Much like Walmart, Best Buy offers a slight advantage for some Black Friday shoppers because it has tons of physical retail stores throughout the U.S. Previously, the large majority of people would actually get up early on Black Friday and go wait in line to be the first ones there, and some even camped out from the night before to ensure they never missed out on the biggest door buster deals.
Source: Best Buy
Recently, things have changed and a ton of Black Friday shopping is actually done online, but that doesn't mean people aren't still going out to shop. Black Friday is such a huge shopping event for the company that Best Buy recaps it each year and publishes that online to show how it's evolved over the years. When is Black Friday at Best Buy? Like everywhere else, Black Friday is officially November 29, 2019, but that won't stop the big-box retailer from offering up sales before that. Last year, Best Buy offered different doorbuster type deals that you could purchase online for each day of the month. We expect that big sales will kick off the Sunday before, and several of the biggest ones may even begin on Thanksgiving Day. Looking back at 2018's best Black Friday deals at Best Buy During Black Friday 2018, Best Buy offered up a huge variety of deals on nearly everything. Whether you were looking for a cheap cable to charge your phone, a new TV for your living room, a cooking gadget, or some additional home security, Best Buy had it all. Looking back on last year's offerings helps give us a look into what we may expect to see this year, so let's recap. Best Buy is no stranger to TV discounts, and often times blows out the pricing on a few models to help get people in the doors of its physical stores. Last year, we saw Samsung's UN65NU6070FXZA go on sale for just $599, which was $200 lower than the normal price. It's a 65-inch 4K TV that had some really great reviews. Like other retailers, there were several of TCL's Roku TVs on sale, along with Insignia and Toshiba's Fire Edition TVs, which are exclusive to Amazon and Best Buy. When it comes to smart home accessories and devices, Best Buy is one of the few places that sells both Google and Amazon's devices, which means that it's the best place for most consumers to shop. Last year, Best Buy bundled a Ring Video Doorbell Pro with a Chime Pro and an Echo Dot for just $180. When purchased separately, this bundle would retail for nearly $350. There were also discounts on Ring's Alarm and other security cameras, discounted Echo Dots, and more. On the Google front, the Home Mini dropped down to just $24, the Home Hub hit $80, and the Nest Hello was down to $180. If you've ever been inside a Best Buy store, you likely have noticed the dedicated Apple section within it. Luckily, much of the Apple lineup was also on sale for Black Friday, though in comparison to what we've seen on the deal front this year, last year's offerings were quite weak. Things like the previous-gen iPad mini and iPad were on sale for $50 off, and the iPad Pro was also discounted. Beyond just tech, at Best Buy there was also discounts galore on refrigerators, washers, dryers, robot vacuums, blenders, Keurigs, and so much more. What deals do we expect from Best Buy on Black Friday? Thanks to its vast product selection, there will be all sorts of big deals available at Best Buy on Black Friday. Whether you are in the market for a new TV, iPad, phone, or even appliance, odds are you'll be able to find what you want at a nice discount. Based on the deals we've seen from Best Buy over the past few years, we were able to put together some predictions on what we can anticipate for 2019. Apple's lineup will likely drop to all-time lows
Source: Android Central
Whether it be an iPad or Apple Watch that you are in the market for, the holiday shopping season will most likely bring Apple's products down to some great pricing. Things like the all-new iPad (2019) will be available for $30 (or maybe even $50) off, making it start at just $299. You'll probably be able to save around $75 on the iPad Air (2019), and the iPad Pro models will be up to $200 off depending on which configuration you opt to purchase. The Apple Watch Series 3 is likely to start at under $180, which makes it a no-brainer purchase, and the latest Series 5 will probably drop by $50 or more. Hardware isn't the only thing that will be discounted. Apple's official accessories, like the Smart Keyboard, Apple Pencil, Watch Bands, and more should also receive sizeable discounts. We don't expect many big deals on the unlocked iPhone models, but if you are okay with purchasing on a carrier agreement, Best Buy will be offering deals from AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint. This can include large trade-in bonuses when you switch carriers or even BOGO offers where you get two for the price of one. Amazon and Google will battle for rock-bottom pricing As previously mentioned, Best Buy is one of the few places where you can buy hardware from both Amazon and Google's lineup, making it a great place for everyone to shop. Each year, we've seen both the Echo Dot and Home Mini compete directly in pricing, with the low being $24 so far. Odds are that this year both lineups will start at just $20, if not even down to $15. The choice between the two comes down to personal preference and some of your existing gear, so be sure to see which ecosystem will be best for you ahead of time. In addition, Ring and Google's video doorbells will definitely be on sale, along with discounts on the home security cameras and do it yourself alarm systems. These will likely hit all-time low pricing for the holidays, so if you haven't already bought one you'll want to wait a few more weeks to see what the official deals are. You'll want to wait for Black Friday's TV deals For years, Best Buy has offered some of the best TV deals of any other retailer during Black Friday. We don't expect 2019 to be any different. There will be something for everyone, regardless of size preference, pricing constraints, and features that you're looking for. Best Buy is one of the only places selling the Toshiba Fire Edition TVs, and this year we expect that they can be discounted by $100 or more, which would make them start at just $150. This is insane pricing for a 43-inch 4K Smart TV that has Amazon's Fire TV OS built right into it. If you prefer Roku over Fire TV, the TCL 6-series LED TVs will likely be on sale in all sizes, with discounts of $125 or more. TCL offers sizes from as small as 32 inches all the way up to 65 inches. You should probably upgrade those aging appliances Bundle deals are the way to go during Black Friday when it comes to appliance discounts. That means that pairing a new washer with a dryer will often times offer you the biggest cost savings. Sometimes, you can even outfit your whole kitchen thanks to some hefty discounts. Washers, dryers, stoves, refridgerators, and more from popular brands like LG, Samsung, KitchenAid, GE and more will all be on sale. Combine these discounts with extended financing when using a Best Buy credit card and you've just added a whole lot of value to your home without spending too much upfront.

The Malta-based payments arm of luxury lifestyle management and financial solutions provider Insignia has launched C by Insignia, a market-first corporate payment solution developed for top-tier executives.
Created for businesses that demand an exceptional level of support for high-flying senior management, C by Insignia’s flexible suite of payment cards is underpinned by the organisation’s hallmark high-end travel and lifestyle management service.
The cards are powered by Visa Business for worldwide acceptance and offer substantial spending power, deferred payments on purchases and no interest charges. They can be administered via an online portal – the C-Panel, developed by Maltese-based IT company Insinet – which provides effective expenses management support with real-time control.
Card members are assigned their own dedicated group personal assistant, supported by Insignia’s experienced travel and concierge experts.
The team’s 98 per cent success rate has prompted The Financial Times to refer to Insignia as “the ultimate wish granters”, while its extensive partner network can deliver substantial savings on travel expenses.
Insignia president George Kesidy commented: “Insignia card members, who enjoy outstanding spending power and ultra-bespoke lifestyle management have been asking when they can access that quality of service in their business life too. We’re proud to now be able to unveil this extraordinary product to them and look forward to exceeding the expectations of a greater number of corporate clients beyond.”
Insignia Cards general manager Jonathan Bellizzi added: “The bespoke nature and incomparable quality of our products, combined with the exceptional nature of our customer base, meant it was only a matter of time before we launched our unique offering to the corporate market space.
“I believe there’s no other kind of product out there that matches the power, control and support that C by Insignia offers to businesses.”

With over 19,000 cards in the game, Magic: the Gathering has cemented itself as the most complex game known to humankind so far. Deckbuilding is as much an art form as it is a science, and many players look at their decks are labors of love and art. This is very true of Commander players especially, where a metagame isn’t as enforced as formats like Modern or Legacy. Today, we at Bleeding Cool will be continuing our series of articles on how to improve the Commander 2019 preconstructed decks. A week ago, on Tuesday, August 13th, we improved upon Faceless Menace. Two days later, we worked on Mystic Intellect. Today, we will be focusing on improving “Primal Genesis”. This deck is based highly around the Populate mechanic, and is a token deck at heart. We will be aiming to emphasize this main trait of the deck with our choices.
Choice of Commander for Primal Genesis
As I had discussed in the articles for improving Faceless Menace and for improvinng Mystic Intellect, for this specific series of articles we are first going to be focusing heavily on the “face commander” of the precon. This means the commander who is featured on the front of the deck’s packaging. I may be writing more articles soon about the other commanders in the precons, but for now, let us focus on the face commander for Primal Genesis: Ghired, Conclave Exile.
Best Choices for Cuts
The following twenty Magic: the Gathering cards were cut from Primal Genesis to make room for new addiitons to the deck, for varied reasons. Some were not synergistic with the theme, some cards were outclassed by other cards, and some where simply unecessary in general. The list of cuts and why they were cut is as follows:
Creature (9)
Atla Palani, Nest Tender – Not entirely synergistic in the 99 of a deck, better as own commander
Roc Egg – Generally useless without Atla Palani, Nest Tender
Dragonmaster Outcast – Small body and easily disruptable due to slow speed of effect
Tectonic Hellion – Land destruction is strong but usually begrudged
Doomed Artisan – see Dragonmaster Outcast
Soul of Zendikar – Expensive body that makes expensive bodies
Giant Adephage – Too slow to make effect impactful
Scaretiller – Not synergistic, expensive body for its ability
Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage – Not durable, populate is mana-intensive
Sorcery (3)
Explore – Ramp outclassed by Kodama’s Reach
Harmonize – Superfluous and expensive draw spell
Hate Mirage – Generally outclassed by Mirror March
Instant (2)
Momentous Fall – Superfluous and outclassed by Shamanic Revelation
Trostani’s Judgment – Far more expensive than its effect should cost
Land (3)
Kazandu Refuge – Superfluous and outclassed overall by Talisman cycle
Graypelt Refuge – see Kazandu Refuge
Rugged Highlands – see above, but with the added note that Highlands doesn’t gain you life
Enchantment (2)
Commander’s Insignia – “Anthem” effects were less necessary with larger bodies
Elemental Bond – Superfluous draw effect, and we already have Garruk’s Packleader
Planeswalker (1)
Garruk, Primal Hunter – Outclassed by Garruk Wildspeaker to a degree, too green-intensive
This deck was admittedly quite hard to make cuts for. The deck as a whole is very solid, and the rest of the deck is already quite formidable. Our additions will be great for making this Magic deck even better than it already is.
Choices for Additions, and Where to Obtain Them
Like I did with Faceless Menace and Mystic Intellect, I have compiled a list of the good additions for the deck. I tried to use newer cards from sets mostly in print, although some cards are older and thus are a bit less easily-accessible. That being said, you can view my completed decklist here, with a more detaild list of reasons for the changes. This decklist is in my TappedOut link, here.
Creature (7)
Omnath, Locus of Rage (Battle for Zendikar)
God-Eternal Oketra (War of the Spark)
Voice of Resurgence (Modern Masters 2017)
Armada Wurm (Selesnya Guild Kit)
Sun Titan (Commander 2019)
Avenger of Zendikar (Commander 2018)
Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker (Iconic Masters)
Sorcery (1)
Kodama’s Reach (Ultimate Masters)
Artifact (6)
Strionic Resonator (Commander 2019)
God-Pharaoh’s Gift (Hour of Devastation)
Throne of the God-Pharaoh (Amonkhet)
Talisman of Impulse (Mirrodin)
Talisman of Conviction (Modern Horizons)
Talisman of Unity (Mirrodin)
Enchantment (5)
Anointed Procession (Amonkhet)
Warstorm Surge (Commander 2019)
Mirror March (Ravnica Allegiance)
Luminarch Ascension (Masters 25)
Sandwurm Convergence (Amonkhet)
Planeswalker (1)
Garruk Wildspeaker (Duel Deck Antholog: Garruk Vs. Liliana)
Concluding Improvements
In testing the Magic: the Gathering deck I found it to be quite aggressive right off the bat, even by Commander’s standards. It does the exact thing you want it to do, provided you make sure you time the populating right and pretty much always are on an offensive. If you try it yourself, feel free to comment on how Primal Genesis works for you, and if the improvements we have made are any good.
Magic: the Gathering – Commander 2019 releases to local game stores on August 23rd in English, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian.

Everything You Need To Know To Get Started
Using online casinos to make bets and win cash has as much risk as playing the stock market. However, if you want to try your luck, and you want to feel as though you are somewhat in control of where your money goes, consider some of the best Canadian online casinos. These Canadian online casinos can be played from any desktop or laptop computer, and you can choose from any casino, and any starting bet amount.
Keep in mind that the Canadian dollar is higher in value, and therefore the amounts shown will be higher than you might expect. In the U.S. the winnings will be transferred into U.S. currency, which is less than the Canadian amount. (It helps to keep a currency exchange calculator handy when you begin this process until you get the hang of it.)
Additionally, online gambling is not regulated in any way by state or federal governments, which means that they do not keep track of your gambling habits, your winnings, or the companies that allow you to gamble out-of-state or out-of-country. Even when gambling is illegal in your state (and there are a few states that do not allow certain casino activities), you can still use the best online casinos to play and make some money. In states where you can only gamble and play slots or casino games on Native American reservations, you can still play online casino games at home!
Characteristics Of The Best Canadian Online Casinos
There are many characteristics that define the best online casinos. You should know what to look for when you are searching through these immense lists of Canadian online casinos. To help you out, the following features are definitely what you should be looking for in an online casino.
Multiple Payment Options
Can you deposit money with the casino via digital money transfers, credit cards, bank cards, cash transfers, automated withdrawals, etc.? If so, this is definitely one of the best online casinos in Canada. Being able to take all forms of payment to make a bet ensures that you can control how your account is funded before you make bets and play games. If you like dealing in Bitcoin, there are plenty of cryptocurrency online casinos that take Bitcoin and alt-coins as well.
The casinos that also allow you to select how you will receive your winnings is worth consideration as well. There are only a handful of casinos that will allow you to split your winnings among or between different payment methods, but if you already know that you want your winnings deposited into your Paypal or Venmo account versus receiving the money directly into your checking account, or receiving payment in the cryptocurrency of your choice.
Bonus Spins for Buying in at Specific Levels
Who doesn’t like bonus-anything? Some of the best Canadian online casinos start out asking for “x” amount of dollars to be placed in your betting account, but they are willing to offer bonus spins in slots or roulette if you are willing to buy in at the level they are asking/offering. Since most gambling consumers are likely to plug in that much money eventually, you can do it right away and play out the account, plus your bonus spins!
Best Security Measures
There are always risks with inputting your financial information with a any business online. The Canada online casinos know this, which is why they often request that you place your first bet or deposit over the phone. They can help you establish an account where your information will be protected, and form the right security measures and security links to protect your chosen forms of payment in the future. The best online casinos in Canada also provide guarantees in terms of privacy and security, which they will proudly display on their websites. If you are not required to jump through several security hoops to establish a secure link to a gambling website, you should probably avoid that site (and others like it!).
Best Customer Service
You should be able to contact a casino’s customer service department four different ways; online chat, email, phone, and text. Some other casinos may even use services like Skype so that you can see who you are talking to; it establishes a sense of trust between consumer/player and the online casino. They should be available at all hours, and be able to answer your questions and resolve your issues and concerns fully. If they are not available, can never be reached by any of the communications methods listed, or have very limited means to communicate with you, avoid those casinos.
Licensing Should Be Clearly Displayed
Licensed online casinos have the country of licensing clearly listed on the website’s home page. You should be able to find the country’s insignia, licensing info, and the regulating body for the online casino either at the bottom or the top of the landing page of the casino. If you cannot find any licensing info anywhere, or the site only hints at belonging to this or that country, avoid it. This is probably not a safe online casino with which to do business, and you might be taken for everything you got!
It is also a good idea to see when the online casino was established. Regulation of online gambling in various countries did not begin until recently, but the casinos that have the longest history are a safe bet (pun intended!). If you are wondering if other players are happy with a particular Canadian online casino, find the online casino reviews or the forums where fellow online gamblers have plenty to say about the casinos you are most interested in engaging.
No Requirements, Lengthy Contracts, or Penalization for Closing Accounts
Most online casinos require that you make a first-time deposit. That is acceptable, but it is usually a guideline and not an expected amount before they allow you to play. If you want the promotional bonuses offered, then you do have to comply with requirements to get the bonuses, but that is still your choice. Requirements should never make unnecessary demands or financial burdens on you to allow you to play.
There should never be any lengthy contracts to sign digitally either. All the rules and expectations from the online casino should be straightforward and direct. There should be no double-talk or legal jargon you cannot understand.
Finally, any account you open should be one that you are free to close at any time without any penalties. Playing online casino games should not be financially threatening! In fact, such actions are considered illegal in most countries that license online casinos. If you see any online casino contract that says that your remaining winnings or account deposit belongs to the online casino if you close your account after a certain period is definitely an online casino you should avoid!
A Well-Educated Player Is Safe And Has Fun
Just to help you avoid some of the scarier sites and horror stories about online gambling and casinos, and put you on the right path to the best online casinos, you should be reading up on how to do this right. It can be scary at first, but there are plenty of sites, blogs, and community forums that will teach and instruct you about these sorts of entertainment venues. You might even learn a few things about the odds of winning and cashing out big.
There are about 100 really good Canadian sites you might enjoy, but if and when you are particularly new to online casinos and gambling, it helps to follow informative and educational online posts, like this one. The amount of tips and information you can glean before you start playing could save you hundreds to thousands of dollars in the long run, and protect your financial payment methods from illegal and fraudulent activity. These activities should be fun and exciting, and not terrifying or worrisome. That is why you can count on all of the information provided above, and know that you will have a safe and fun time in Canadian online casinos.
A Final Word About Responsible Gambling
Many online casinos have limits. This ensures that players are not gambling into a monetary hole they cannot get out of. It also protects the online casinos from being sued when family members find out how much money the gambler has lost.
Still, you should be aware that some of the responsibility for gambling falls to you. It is, after all, your money. It can be exciting to play and possibly win some money, but if you start losing a lot, you may want to take some time off from the online casinos and games. If you cannot do that, you may develop a gambling addiction, and recognizing that you may have that problem is the first step toward asking for help. Some casinos may even offer potential addicts referrals to get help, which makes them even better sites to play.

YouTrip is Singapore’s first multi-currency mobile wallet with a prepaid Mastercard® that offers zero transaction fees across 150+ currencies at wholesale exchange rates
US$25.5m raised from major Asian family offices and venture capital firm Insignia Ventures Partners, the largest pre-Series A fintech funding round in Southeast Asia
Over 200,000 downloads and 1 million transactions processed 10 months since launch
Funding will drive development of YouTrip’s technical payment infrastructure, launch of new product features and its regional expansion plans in Southeast Asia


SINGAPORE – Media OutReach – 16 May 2019 – YouTrip , Singapore’s first multi-currency mobile wallet with a prepaid Mastercard ®, has successfully raised US$25.5m in a pre-Series A fundraise. Participating investors include major Asian family offices and venture capital firm Insignia Ventures Partners, founded by ex-Sequoia Partner Yinglan Tan. This marks the largest pre-Series A funding round for a fintech startup operating in Southeast Asia.




YouTrip co-founders, Arthur Mak and Caecilia Chu




The YouTrip team in Hong Kong office
Launched in August 2018, YouTrip is a multi-currency mobile wallet s pecially designed with travellers in mind, allow ing users to pay in over 150 currencies with no hidden fees and at wholesale exchange rates . The mobile app also allows for the exchange and storage of 10 selected currencies in advance through the in-app exchange feature. The YouTrip mobile application works with a linked pre-paid Mastercard ® — issued by EZ-Link — and can be used to make payments at more than 30 million Mastercard accepting merchants worldwide.
Fuelled by growing purchasing power and more affordable travel options , Southeast Asia’s population of over 650 million people represents one of the largest and fastest growing outbound travellers market globally – it is expected to total US$80 billion in outbound travel expenditure by 2020, up from US$67 billion in 2018 or a 10% CAGR. Singapore is the biggest contributor to this region, with Singaporeans being one of the most frequent travellers and biggest travel spenders globally.
Caecilia Chu, co- f ounder and CEO of YouTrip said, “As a frequent traveller, I was surprised with how much banks mark up on overseas transactions – this was among the many reasons why I started YouTrip with Arthur Mak, who is also Chairman of YouTrip . As the regional travel industry continues to post robust growth, YouTrip recognises the pain points of travellers and equally, the immense opportunity to better serve their financial needs. We are dedicated to creating the best mobile financial services for travellers by simplifying overseas spending and creating a fuss-free travel experience.”
Pachara Lawjindakul, Principal at Insignia Ventures Partners added, “The fintech space in Southeast Asia is developing at a relentless pace to meet evolving consumer expectations and the travel industry represents an immense untapped market at the intersection of this growth. YouTrip is led by an experienced team of founders and executive team who are perfectly positioned to capitalise on this opportunity. The success of the initial launch in Singapore provides a great foundation to develop a strong roadmap for growing the multi-currency and cross-border payments ecosystem in Southeast Asia.”
Bank-issued credit and debit cards typically carry an overseas transaction fee that can be as high as 3.5%. O verseas purchases made with credit cards also usually entail a Dynamic Currency Conversion markup, sometimes going as high as 5% or more. YouTrip does not charge any overseas transaction fees nor markup on foreign exchange conversion .

Camouflaged Opel Insignia prototype previews potential mid-life refresh for Holden's German-sourced large car.
The facelifted Opel Insignia Sports Tourer has been snapped by photographers at the famed Nurburgring circuit in Germany, hinting at what's in store for the Holden Commodore Sportwagon.
Like previous prototypes we've seen recently, the refreshed Insignia/Commodore will don revised designs for the front and rear fascias, with rejigged lighting at both ends and subtle changes to the bumpers.
We reckon the new-generation Opel Corsa is a good indication of what the Insignia's general design language will look like.
It appears the changes at the rear will be less pronounced than the front, though the high-spec GSi model you see here will likely get revised LED internals for the tail-lights.

When it comes to keeping cold brew and late-night snacks chilled, a great mini fridge in your dorm room is a total college must-have. But with so many different configurations and sizes, it can be tricky to decide which is the best mini fridge for you — especially since you could be using it for the next four years and more!
According to our Good Housekeeping Institute kitchen experts, dorm fridges are best suited for chilling beverages or storing lunches for a couple days, max. That's because they can rarely be counted on to keep perishable foods cold for long periods of time. In order for food to be safe, meats, dairy, and cut fruits or veggies must be kept below 40°F (and above 32°F, if you don't want them to freeze). Our Lab tests on compact fridges found that most temperatures hovered at the high end of this range, so you don't want to risk it.

What is a good size fridge for a dorm room?
Dorm rooms are small (and often shared with one or more person), so it really depends on how much space you have. Mini refrigerators, also known as compact refrigerators, vary in size from 1.7 cubic feet up to 4.5 cubic feet. The smallest cube-shaped mini fridge measures 17 inches wide, 18 7/8 inches deep and 20 1/2 inches tall. A larger 4.5 cubic foot model with a separate freezer measures around 19 inches wide, 20 inches deep and 43 inches tall. If you're unsure about what size to get, wait until after move-in day so you can measure the space you have available.
Do I need a mini fridge with a freezer?
Probably not. Freezer space in dorm fridges can take up a good amount of real estate, and often isn't used at all. Plus, many of the less expensive models require manual defrosting which could be annoying and time-consuming for already-busy college kids. Think about what you're going to use it for most. If it's just drinks and a few snacks, you might be better off with a beverage fridge with a cool tempered glass front.

A graphic designer from Virginia never expected his fake presidential seal to be featured on stage ... [+] with President Donald Trump. Charles Leazott
The last place graphic designer Charles Leazott expected to see his fake presidential seal was on a screen with President Donald Trump smiling in front of it. The seal, which features "45 is a puppet" and a bald eagle holding golf clubs, appeared behind Trump Tuesday when he took the stage at the Teen Student Action Summit hosted by the conservative group Turning Point USA.
"I'd say it's pretty emblematic of the entire administration. There are only two options here [for why this happened]," Leazott, of Virginia, told me. "This really was an accident and their incompetence knows no bounds [or] someone did this on purpose and they're lying to cover that fact up."
A graphic designer from Virginia never expected his fake presidential seal to be featured on stage ... [+] with President Donald Trump. The Independent
Leazott created the seal in late 2016 as nothing more than a way to vent and entertain his friends and family following Trump's political ascendance. The seal was popular enough that Leazott launched one-term-donnie.myshopify.com for people to buy goods featuring the image.
"I allowed the website to lapse later in 2017 as I didn't have the time to invest in it," Leazott said. "Cut to today and I put the site back up."
Leazott's seal made it to Reddit's front page Thursday where it collected more than 15,000 votes and 800 comments. One comment from redditor IHv2RtrnSumVdeotapes broke down all the details in Leazott's seal:
"45 is a puppet" in Spanish
The hammer and sickles in the flag crest
The golf clubs instead of arrows
The talon gripping cash
The Russian double header eagle
"Today has been a whirlwind to say the least. I've had a huge grin on my face since this morning," Leazott said. "The Trump administration is a dumpster fire and an embarrassment. I'm not saying anything new here."
The audiovisual aide allegedly responsible for placing the seal behind Trump has since been fired, CNN reported.

Buying miles through annual fees instead of requesting for the annual fee waiver may be a good way of growing your miles balance, but be sure to evaluate your alternatives.
One of the main reasons I prefer miles cards over cashback is because paying an annual fee on a miles card can actually make sense.
Pay an annual fee on a cashback card, and you’re now in a net negative position where you need to earn your way back to zero. Pay an annual fee on a miles card and, more often than not, you’ll receive some miles in return.
Therefore, miles card holders are effectively hedged – if the bank waives your annual fee, great! If not, at least you won’t be out of pocket, because those miles are worth something.

Let’s look at the four questions to ask yourself before requesting for an annual fee waiver on your air miles credit card.


Question 1: How many miles will you get from paying the annual fee?
Not all cards are equal when it comes to giving miles with annual fees. Here’s a rundown of the annual fees and miles offered on each card, as well as the effective cost per mile.

Card Income Req. Annual Fee Miles Cost per mile HSBC Visa Infinite $120,000 $488 (Premier banking)
$650 (Regular)
35,000 – First year
0 – Subsequent
1.39 (Premier banking)
1.86 (regular)
SCB Visa Infinite $150,000 $588.50 35,000 – First year
20,000 – Subsequent
1.68 (first year)2.9 (subsequent) Citi PremierMiles AMEX $80,000 $267.50 15,000 1.78 OCBC 90N Card $30,000 $192.60* 10,000 1.93 DBS Altitude Visa/AMEX $30,000 $192.60* 10,000 1.93 KrisFlyer UOB Credit Card $30,000 $192.60* 10,000 1.93 Citi PremierMiles Visa $30,000 $192.60* 10,000 1.93 Citi Prestige $120,000 $535 25,000 2.14 OCBC VOYAGE $120,000 $488$3,210 (alt option) 15,000
150,000 (alt option)
3.25
2.14 (alt option)
SCB X Card $80,000 $695.50 30,000 – First year unknown how many miles will be given with renewal 2.31 UOB Visa Infinite Metal Card $150,000 $642 25,000 2.57 Citi ULTIMA $500,000 $4,160 150,000 2.77 DBS Insignia $500,000 $3,210 100,000 3.21 UOB Visa Infinite $350,000 $1,926 60,000 3.21 UOB Reserve $500,000 $3,852 100,000 3.85
*Annual fee waiver is available. If fee is waived, no miles are granted.
The UOB PRVI Miles card, BOC Elite Miles World Mastercard, AMEX KrisFlyer Ascend and AMEX KrisFlyer Credit Card do not offer any miles with payment of the annual fee.
Do note you cannot pay your annual fee more than once a year to earn additional miles – an annual fee is precisely that: annual!
Question 2: How much should you pay per mile?
A natural question that arises is whether it’s “worth it” to buy miles at X cents each. To answer that, you need to know how to value a mile, and as I mentioned in this post, it’s inherently subjective. A good benchmark to use is about 1.8 to 1.9 cents each, but some people will value them higher and others lower.
When coming to your personal valuation, it’s helpful to consider the full range of options for buying miles, of which annual fees are just one.

Pros Cons Price Range Credit Card Annual Fees Automatically given with payment of annual fee; no effort required on the part of cardholder Can only be done once per membership year. Tends to be more expensive than other methods 1.39-3.85 cents Tax Payment Facilities Offer some of the lowest rates for buying miles Requires IRAS NOA as supporting documentation. You cannot
“overpay” your tax bill to buy more miles



1.14-2.5 cents Bill Payment Facilities (e.g. CardUp, RentHero, Citi PayAll) Allows you to earn miles on things like rent, MCST fees, season parking, education expenses, electricity bills and more Requires supporting documentation, like a tenancy agreement or invoice. You cannot “overpay” your bills to buy more miles 1.21-2.11 cents “Pay Anything” Facilities (e.g UOB PRVI Pay, OCBC VOYAGE Pay) Do not require any supporting documentation Only available on selected cardsTends to be more expensive than tax or bill payment facilities 1.9-2.1 cents
If you have cheaper options at your disposal, then you may not find it worthwhile buying miles through annual fees.
Question 3: Will you get the same number of miles every year?
Standard Chartered is careful to label the 35,000 miles given with the Visa Infinite as a “welcome gift”- you only get it once! More
Most credit cards will give you the same number of miles each year you pay the annual fee. However, this isn’t always the case. Two notable exceptions are the SCB Visa Infinite and the HSBC Visa Infinite – in the first year, they’ll give you 35,000 miles each. In the second, that drops to 20,000 for the SCB Visa Infinite and nothing for the HSBC Visa Infinite.

Combat uniform of Artillery found from his car
Tribune News Service
Amritsar, August 25
Acting on a tip-off provided by Army officers, the police have arrested a fake Army personnel at a checkpoint here on Saturday. He was driving a vehicle with an insignia of Army attached on it. He was identified as Sukhjinder Singh Khera, who hailed from Khera Majjan Singh village in Kapurthala. At present, he was in live-in relationship with a woman at Bath Avenue here.
According to information, Khera’s father, Mohan Singh Khera, retired as a Lieutenant Colonel and had expired around a decade ago. He allegedly morphed and forged his father and mother’s identity cards also.
A case under Sections 419, 420, 467, 471, 473, 170 and 171 of the IPC has been registered against him. He was produced in court and remanded in police custody further interrogation. The police impounded the car with an insignia of Army attached on it. Sources said Army authorities had submitted a complaint against him to Police Commissioner SS Srivastva around a week ago. Following this, the police started a hunt to nab him and he was intercepted at a checkpoint here on Saturday.
During a preliminary probe, the police found two Aadhaar cards from his possession. One was of Ludhiana and the other was of Amritsar. However, he was not living at the two residential addresses giving in these identity cards. A combat uniform of Artillery with badges of flying officer was also found from the car. Besides, the police confiscated around five passbooks and cheque books.
He had been in a live-in relationship with a woman in Amritsar for the past one-and-a-half years. He was fooling her by claiming to be an Army officer. She told the police that on the pretext of going out for duties he used to remain away from home for many days together before returning home.
Sandeep Kumar Malik, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, said though he had admitted that he had fake identity cards of Army in his possession and that his father had retired from the Army. He said his antecedents were being verified.

New Vauxhall Insignia Grand Sport vs used Audi A4 – driving
Sporty handling isn't on the cards with a car as large as the Insignia, but it is at least easy to thread along a twisting country road. Its steering is reasonably accurate and there’s plenty of grip for you to carry speed into a bend. However, the car feels heavy and is cumbersome on tight city streets and in car parks. The last point makes parking sensors an absolute must-have. Ride quality is best on the standard 17in wheels; otherwise, the Insignia fidgets and thumps considerably when it encounters a pothole.
The ride can also be a problem if you go for an S line or sports suspension-equipped A4, so we’re recommending you stick with a Sport model and standard wheels for the best ride and handling combination. Like so, the A4 drives over lumps and bumps with aplomb yet doesn’t feel at all floaty on the motorway. Its steering is light just off-centre but builds up weight in a progressive manner at speed, giving you the confidence to place the car precisely in corners.

Story 25
There’s plenty out there to collect when it comes to the Apollo 11 lunar mission. And for good reason. It’s not like man steps on the moon for the first time very often. 1969 Topps Man on the Moon trading cards look at the lead-up to July 20, 1969 and Neil Armstrong’s small step that has left a mark on history forever.
Over the course of 55 cards, the set offers a brief but intimate look at the planning and work that went into getting Armstong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins into space. Despite the small checklist, plenty of ground is covered. The planning for Apollo 11 started before Apollo 11. Previous missions show the ships, sights from space and the science that went into it all.
Card backs form one of two different puzzles. The 35 ‘A’ cards make one of the Apollo 11 crew: Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins. The remaining 20 ‘B’ cards go together to form the Apollo 10 command module.
Card fronts have both the image and a small caption explaining what’s going on. The result is an abbreviated lesson in the mission. Decades later, the context is a look back at history as it was still unfolding. Not many trading card sets can make a similar claim.
1970 Re-Issue
The original 1969 Topps Man on the Moon set focuses on the lead-up. In 1970 Topps re-issued the set, this time expanding the checklist to include the actual mission and landing.
An additional 44 cards were added to the checklist, some of which feature iconic images still engrained in the collective consciousness.
The first 55 cards are virtually the same. Images and captions don’t change. But there is an easy way to identify them from the original 1969 cards. The number of the back of the re-issue cards all say “of 99.” 1969 Topps Man on the Moon cards have either an “A” or “B” with the number.
So, “19A Launching Pad!” is an original 1969 card. “9 of 99 Launching Pad!” comes from the 1970 reissue.
Down-to-Earth Prices
1969 Topps Man on the Moon ranks as one of the more recognized non-sport sets of its era. However, that hasn’t necessarily translated into high values. Prices on raw singles vary based on condition, which is to be expected. Usually, though, individual cards are no more than a few dollars each.
Other than normal wear of things like corners and sides that come with handling, centering is a significant issue.
Even professionally graded NM-MT copies shouldn’t break the bank on their own. MINT copies creep up somewhat, but not to the same extent of some other sets from the era. Simply put, 1969 Topps Man on the Moon remains a largely affordable set for the average collector.

Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) stock is up by about 4x over 2019, driven by its rapidly expanding software platform business, which sells advertising and streaming video content. Much like Netflix, Roku has benefited from the acceleration of cord-cutting and the pivot toward streaming services. However, the business models of the two companies are different: Roku acts as a platform that connects users with digital streaming content, while Netflix invests heavily in programming. In this analysis, we compare Roku’s growth with the early-stage growth of Netflix streaming platform, looking at key metrics including the number of subscribers, per-user revenues, and margins.
View our interactive dashboard analysis How Does Roku Compare With Netflix In Its Early Years?
We use a 2015 to 2019E timeline for Roku, given that financial data is only available for this period. Moreover, the platform business really came to the fore during these years, before which Roku was viewed primarily as a hardware business.
While Netflix launched its streaming service in 2007, the company offered the service as a bundle with its DVD business, only breaking it out into a separate business in 2011.
For this analysis, we use DVD+Streaming subscribers data from 2008-2011 and Streaming-only figures (U.S. + International) from 2011 to 2015.
No. Of Subscribers: Roku Currently Has A Similar Number Of Subscribers As Netflix Did 5 Years Into Its Streaming Business
Roku had about 27 million platform users at the end of 2018 and the number is projected to grow to over 35 million in 2019. In comparison, Netflix had about 33 million streaming subscribers at the end of 2012, 5 years post the launch of its streaming service.
The growth rates of the two companies’ subscriber bases have been similar, although Netflix’s growth has been more volatile.
As Roku largely caters to users in the U.S. and to an extent in Europe, it may have room to scale-up internationally, just like Netflix.
Netflix ARPUs Significantly Higher Than Roku’s
Roku’s monthly ARPUs are well below Netflix, as it only acts as a go-between between content providers/advertisers and its users, unlike Netflix which actually provides content.
However, it has been posting higher ARPU growth compared to Netflix in its early years of streaming, albeit on a much lower base.
Note: Netflix ARPUs between 2009-2011 include DVD+ Streaming. ARPUs from 2012 onward are streaming only.
Roku’s Platform Revenue Growth Has Outpaced Netflix
Roku has posted higher revenue growth, driven by its rising user base and growing ARPUs.
Netflix growth has been slower, coming in at levels of 20-30% between 2009 and 2011 (when it offered DVD+Streaming bundles), while posting growth of between 30% to 40% post-2012.
Roku’s Margins Are Higher Than Netflix
Roku’s Platform Gross Margins are significantly higher than Netflix Contribution margins since Roku operates largely on a commission basis and doesn’t invest meaningfully in content.
However, Roku’s margins have been trending lower, driven partly by a higher mix of video-ads, while Netflix margins have been rising, likely due to better economies of scale.
Contribution Profits are defined as revenues less Cost of Revenue and Marketing Expenses.
Roku’s P/S multiple, based on projected 2020 platform revenues, stands at 16x.
In comparison, Netflix’s P/S in 2013 – when the company had largely pivoted to the streaming space – stood at about 6x.
Roku’s higher multiple is likely due to its higher platform margins, better revenue growth rates, and the fact that it is an earlier stage company.
Additionally, unlike Netflix, Roku doesn’t spend on content and it could have more platform stickiness given that customers have to invest in Roku hardware or a Roku-powered Smart TV – which they will likely hold for multiple years.
Conclusion
Roku’s platform performance metrics compare quite favorably to Netflix’s metrics during the early stage of its streaming business.
Moreover, like Netflix, Roku could have scope to scale-up its international operations, as its operations are largely focused on the United States at the moment.

New Experian Tool Allows You to Instantly Boost Your Credit Score
Boosting your credit score often requires months of responsible financial behavior. But a new tool from Experian enables you to instantly add utility and cellphone payments to your credit report, potentially increasing your credit score and helping you pay less to borrow. [USA Today]
Here's How that Fed Rate Hike Will Impact You
With the Federal Reserve's latest quarter-point interest rate increase, few consumers are left unscathed. The decision affects rates on all kinds of borrowing, from home mortgages to credit cards. The Fed made its ninth hike in three years and pushed the federal funds rate target to a new range of 2.25% to 2.5%, its highest level in a decade. As the federal funds rate rises, the prime rate does as well, and credit card rates follow suit. Cardholders will see the impact within a billing cycle or two. [CNBC]
Credit Cards Won't Save Airlines From the Next Downturn
There is a dirty secret behind the record profitability of U.S. airlines in recent years: Credit card fees. Credit cards bearing airline insignia are a lucrative business. Delta Air Lines' partnership with American Express should generate $3.7 billion in revenue for the airline next year, it said Thursday--an 85% increase in five years. Merchants pay credit card issuers and banks when consumers use their cards, and some of these so-called interchange fees are passed onto airlines. This arrangement gives airlines margins as high as 60%, meaning they contribute almost a third of the operating profit reported by major U.S. carriers. [The Wall Street Journal]
The Surprising Place Rewards Cardholders are Getting the Most Cash Back
Buying groceries is bagging a lot of rewards. Rewards cardholders are earning the most points and cash back on their grocery purchases, according to a CreditCards.com report. More than one in three (35%) respondents credited supermarket sweeps for earning the most cash back, followed by travel (27%) gas (23%) and dining (14%). The surveyed respondents on average said they spent $6,477 a year at the supermarket, earning back $185 in rewards cash on average using a card offering 3% cash back on everyday purchases.

What is Magecart? Credit Card-Stealing Malware Proves Hard to Stop
Magecart refers to cyberattacks in which hackers implant malicious computer code into websites and third-party suppliers of digital systems to steal credit card info as people enter it at a checkout page. While the digital theft of credit card info, known as skimming, is not new, attacks on payment pages and smaller companies represent a persistent threat that has proven so successful that it has spawned its own small cottage industry. Magecart's success is partly due to that fact that it is nearly impossible for the consumer to detect. [NBC News]
Capital One Savor Cardholders Can Get a Free Postmates Unlimited Subscription
When Capital One relaunched its Savor card this summer, it offered an excellent value proposition to cardholders: 4% cash back on dining and entertainment, 2% back at grocery stores, and 1% back on everything else. Now, Capital One has added a new perk to the card: a monthly statement credit for the delivery service Postmates Unlimited, from now through December 2019. That's worth up to $120 if you take advantage of it starting this month. Postmates is a crowdsourced service that offers delivery from thousands of restaurants and stores. [Business Insider]
GDPR: EU Sees More Data Breach Reports, Privacy Complaints
Privacy watchdogs in Europe say they are continuing to see an increase in data breach reports as well as privacy complaints. That should be no surprise, because the EU on May 25 began enforcing its General Data Protection Regulation.

GDPR also gives Europeans the ability to file class-action lawsuits against breached organizations. [Bank Info Security]

Story 31
It was clear from the outset that the launch of a Valletta FC branded card in November 2013 was not your normal press event. For a start, it was a gala dinner at one of the most prestigious locations, and the guests included top businessmen and decision-makers. When one of the investors behind the card, Michael Surguladze, and his considerable entourage stepped out of their limousines, any doubt was banished.
This may have been the launch of a card aimed at a few hundred football fans, but the long-term investment was clearly something much larger. Within months, more cards were launched by Insignia Cards, under the Yes brand, aimed at the Maltese market, but even then it was obvious that there was yet more to come.
Mr Surguladze, described by interested parties as “a man of means”, is now happy to reveal the larger picture: a bank to process card payments, tied to a card which will target 10 million users and challenge American Express, and one that could employ as many as 400 people.
Normally, when confronted with such a claim, you would Google the investor to see whether he is up to the challenge, but spare yourself the time: you will not find anything about him online, something that the European Central Bank and Malta Financial Services Authority also clearly realised when they embarked on the strict due diligence required before granting a banking licence.
“They asked me why I don’t give interviews and so here I am,” he said with a shrug.
Considering that it has been some 15 years since he granted an interview, Mr Surguladze was remarkably affable and open. But old habits die hard. He absolutely refused to be photographed.
A Georgian by birth, he moved to Russia and when perestroika paved the way for private business in 1987, he and some others went into publishing, first printing everything from classics to Solzhenitsyn, and then importing foreign magazines.
Football was already a passion and his group was the first to privatise a football club. Decades later, he would become heavily involved with the Red Knights, a group of investors who put together a failed £1.5 billion bid to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family.
“I still want to buy Manchester United!” he laughed.
“When we started showing interest in Manchester United, Everton came along, and wanted us to buy them! I am still very close to people who own sports teams; Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is a very close friend of mine.”
Apart from the Insignia Valletta FC card, he also signed a two-year sponsorship deal with the club which enabled them to get a Dutch coach and manager, as well as a few top players, all of which helped them to win the double.
But it was the company’s links with American Express which set him on the path which brought him to Malta. They introduced the card to the Russian market in 1995 and held the sole agency for seven years. In 2001, they decided to go it alone, wanting to offer a more bespoke product, launching first the Royal card in 2002, aimed at high net worth individuals, and the Glamour card in 2005 for women.
Michael Surguladze declined to be photographed.
“Glamour allowed women to break all spending records! Until 2008, when the crisis really affected women’s spending as their cards were removed,” he said, grinning.
The cards were originally issued by mostly European banks through an affiliated programme, but the company handled the processing, benefits limits, risk and compliance. The thirst to go it alone was still not quenched and in 2007, they decided to try to do without the bank, keeping everything in house, similar to the AmEx model that they knew so well. They started to look around for somewhere to base the payment systems bank – but the project was put on hold during the global financial crisis.
When the project was taken off the back burner, Austria emerged as the favourite location but Mr Surguladze then met Joe Zammit Tabona, at the time Malta’s High Commissioner to London, at a Malta Business Network event.
“He persuaded me to come here and I met seven ministers during that trip,” he said. “The authorities wanted to know what I would offer Malta. Malta is clearly too small to be a market for our cards but they all need to be tested and that is what we have been doing so far. We offer a luxury lifestyle card for a fraction of the cost, with all the benefits that AmEx gives its customers, such as a personal assistant service and higher limits and so on.”
And the Valletta FC card also turned out to be a test before they embarked on a much grander scheme for European club cards.
“The next teams will be a big European one and a British one, one of the greatest British teams – but not Manchester United,” he said with another grin.
Ultra-rich people have excellent connections. Soon you will see the headquarters of the biggest companies here
The plans are grand and will clearly represent considerable investment, much of which will be in developing the new skills this activity will require. He plans to take on young lawyers and accountants and send them overseas for training.
In the meantime Insignia opened a sister company to take over lifestyle management, with Frederick Ellul moving over as CEO, and Tim Zrinzo being appointed CEO of the cards business.
Mr Surguladze thinks that the time is ripe for Malta to learn what the uber-rich want, especially as more and more are drawn to the island by the Individual Investor Programme, pointing out that he is a UK citizen as did not need to apply himself.
“They say some countries are cheaper but here you can get it without any problems. In Portugal it is half the price of Malta but you have to know Portuguese! If you pass the due diligence process you are welcome here.
“My friends are very excited about this programme. It was an amazing decision and it is the future of Malta. By the end of this year, you will see how it will affect you,” he said.
“This is already my second home. What is important is the Maltese people. We feel so comfortable here. And I am welcome everywhere. It is the only English-speaking country in the eurozone and Schengen.
“Ultra-rich people have excellent connections. Soon you will see the headquarters of the biggest companies here. Private jets will be coming here but there is no five-star luxury hotel on the island. The Hilton is fine but this is for tourists. You have no experience here when it comes to dealing with these individuals.
“Malta will need a lot of investment. For example, Valletta will be the European Capital of Culture in 2018. It should not look so shabby. You have the chance to become the centre of financial services in Europe.
“There are problems but they are known. There is a big problem with bureaucracy, a big brake for private sector.”
He has worked with both governments and said he was impressed by the transition.
“I like youngsters. When you get old, you like young people! They might have less experience but they are hungry to transform the country. They have one big benefit. They keep stability.”
While they await the final licences, they are setting up a charity for Maltese children who have a health problem, hospital care to overseas surgery.
“We will put our own money into the Wish Granters Foundation. The Valletta FC sponsorship might have been for public relations but this is not for the media; this is for God. God will see what we are doing...” he said.
He is leaving the charity in the hands of Mr Zammit Tabona, clearly uncomfortable with the limelight.
But he is well aware that with his lack of public track record could generate doubt – and suspicion.
“Unfortunately, too many people associate the lack of a public profile with being a criminal or a money launderer or so on... I understand that when people come from nowhere with billions the assumption is that it is money laundering. But there are a lot of anti-money laundering regulations and compliance processes.
“I put myself as the sole shareholder because I knew that I would be scrutinised by the MFSA, the local intelligence service and the European intelligence service. They will do full due diligence on me. I am sure about my background,” he shrugged.
“The same happened with Roman Abramovich. He was very closed but once he bought Chelsea he knew he had to raise his profile. Buying Chelsea is like buying Buckingham Palace! Everyone wanted to know who he was. And there are plenty of top European businessmen who are the same. But people now need to know who am I, so here I am...”
The plans are to eventually bring big American financial institutions on board, and a few individual investors from different countries which will allow them to tap far- flung markets.
“So the number of shareholders will increase – we also plan to go public. It gives transparency and accountability.”
The Universe card, to be launched in spring, will cost around €100 and will target the ‘mass affluent’ – but would still give them the benefits associated luxury cards which cost €5,000. There will be a welcome pack, assistance with travel and lifestyle support, insurance, rewards programme, and even a birthday present.
How can they afford this? He believes the set-up is the key to success.
“There are only a very few banks which are concentrated only on cards. Capital One is huge but is only focussed on a few markets, the US and the UK. We are focused on emerging markets. Of course we will also bring to the US and the UK but this is not our target.
“Our second competitor is Barclaycard, which is mainly focused on the UK. The third is AmEx itself: they are our competitors and we will challenge them.”

First things first: where is your ID?
Most of us only ever see our ID books (or cards) when we need a certified copy to submit with an application for a job or school admission, or when we need to go to the bank. With the election only a few days away, you may be panicking because you have misplaced your ID. You also need your green barcoded ID book (or your modern ID card) to vote. No, you may not use your driver’s licence, student card or any other form of ID.
The only acceptable substitute is a temporary ID issued by the department of home affairs. If you haven’t applied for a replacement, all offices of the department nationwide will be open from 7am to 9pm on May 8 to issue temporary IDs to voters. So take a deep breath and relax – your government has you covered.
Where are you going to cast your vote?
Do you know where your polling station is? Use the voting station finder on the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) website to help you locate your polling station. When you access the site, there is a prominently marked area on the landing page where you can enter your ID number and search for the name and address of the polling station where you are eligible to vote.
It’s important to check your registration details so you are able to cast both ballots – one for the national election, the other for the provincial election.
For the general election, you are able to vote at a polling station other than the one you are officially registered at, although this is not ideal, nor advisable. If you are in a different province from the one where you are registered, you will only be able to vote in the national election, not the provincial one. The rules are much stricter for local government elections, so remember this well.
Ready, set, GO!
So, you’ve found your polling station and you have your ID with you. The only thing left to do now is cast your ballots. Remember, you must get two ballots – one for the provincial election and the other for the national election.

Opel version of liftback spotted with facial camouflage and cladding on the rear, suggesting a mild mid-life refresh is on the cards for now French-owned family hauler.
The updated Opel Insignia – known locally as the Holden Commodore – has been snapped by photographers this week in Europe, giving an early look as to what to expect from the mid-life refresh.
From what we can see in the images, the Commodore/Insignia has most of its changes focused around the front end, with minimal camouflage at the rear.
We're expecting the main revisions to be focused on the front bumper and grille, along with the headlights.
At the rear, there's some black tape around the tail-lights, though the shape of the lighting units appear to be the same with lightly-revised internals.

If you’re looking for a new way to listen to your favorite songs and podcasts, but don’t want to be tethered to the wall when you do it, Bluetooth speakers are outstanding solutions.
With help from Bluetooth speakers, you can wirelessly beam your music and other audio from your smartphone, tablet, computer, or other devices and listen wherever you are. Best of all, there are a variety of improvements that companies are making to their speakers to boost sound quality and expand the sound range to allow you to stream music from farther than before.
The problem with buying Bluetooth speakers, however, is that there are countless numbers of models available. And in order to find the best options, you’ll want to evaluate Bluetooth range, design, speaker quality, and more. And of course, when it’s all said and done, you’ll want to evaluate how all of those features translate to value for the price.
In order to arrive at our list of the five best options, we evaluated the Bluetooth speakers on a variety of metrics, including their range and number of tweeters. We also analyzed their design and compared all of that against their price to see what kind of value they offer. Strong customer reviews also helped to boost the speakers below.
But luckily for you, we’ve taken the guesswork out of finding your next Bluetooth speaker. We’ve evaluated a slew of options available for under $100 to see what kinds of speaker quality and Bluetooth range they offer. We’ve also evaluated them on price and value. And the following five devices all fit the bill of delivering outstanding features, great designs, and an affordable price.

And since it comes with a built-in power bank, you can connect a USB cable to the device and charge your smartphone while you’re using it.

JBL Charge 3
JBL/Amazon
If you’re looking to buy a higher-end Bluetooth speaker but want to save a few bucks, you’ll want to take quick advantage of the JBL Charge 3 deal on Best Buy.
The JBL Charge 3 typically retails for $150. However, for a limited time, the speaker is available for $100, a $50 savings off its regular retail price. In other words, you can get a device that comes with higher-end features at a price that matches lower-end devices.

JBL’s device is designed to be used outside or inside, but it can be dipped in water at a depth of up to 3.3 feet and still work just fine.

Another JBL favorite, the company’s JBL Link 3 is one of the smartest options in this roundup.

Aside from that, the speaker, which comes with a nice black finish, is capable of connecting to other JBL speakers for multiroom listening. And with its built-in battery, you can expect it to last five hours on a single charge.
All in all, it offers a great value for $60.

With Amazon’s early Cyber Monday sales live and Walmart’s initial Cyber deals starting, it is time for Best Buy to respond. And thanks to industry contacts and historical analysis, I have a good idea exactly how Best Buy will fight back and the biggest deals it will unleash…
My Cyber Monday 2018 store guides are already live for Amazon, for Apple, for Target and for Walmart. Thanks go to my holiday season sales partner, BestBlackFriday.com, who helps to collate all of these deals.
Best Buy
After speaking to industry insiders, the important patterns to note are the highlights from Best Buy’s 16-page Cyber Monday ad last year. These were the top deals:
So what do we learn: the consensus is Best Buy will again repeat its class-leading Galaxy S9, S9+ and Note 9 deals, its solid console deals (a key advantage with Amazon dropping out here) and some noticeable improvements to its TV and fitness tracker deals from last year.
Samsung
These are the deals I believe you will see again with Best Buy’s Cyber Monday 2018 sale:
So what’s the bad news? In short: Best Buy is largely repeating its Black Friday sales without any further discounts when others (like Target’s extra REDCard savings) will do better. The good news is you will get a second chance at many of Best Buy’s best Black Friday deals if you missed out the first time.
Key takeaways from the Best Buy Cyber Monday 2018 sale are the likely return of both its iPhone and Galaxy smartphone deals. While Walmart has even better iPhone deals, Best Buy has the top Samsung phone discount this year as it gives a straight cash saving rather than gift vouchers. Best Buy also has some solid TV deals, particularly at 65-inches.

While Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) is best known for its streaming media players, the company is increasingly positioning itself as a distribution platform for digital content. Roku delivers content and advertising to viewers, much like pay TV operators, although it is an asset-light business with minimal infrastructure investments and lower user acquisition costs. Roku’s user base has been growing at a rapid clip, driven by the acceleration in cord cutting in the U.S. and increasing licensing partnerships with TV producers for the Roku OS. In this analysis, we compare Roku’s platform business with the major U.S. pay-TV players.
View our interactive dashboard analysis on How Does Roku’s Platform Business Stack Up Versus Major Pay TV Players?
Roku Is Already Ahead Of Pay-TV Companies In Terms Of Its User Base
Roku’s active accounts grew from 9.2 million in 2015 to about 27 million in 2018, compared to AT&T and Comcast which both saw subscriber declines.
While Pay TV Accounts Are Shrinking, Roku’s User Base Is Soaring
Roku’s base has been growing at over 40% per year, compared to Comcast and AT&T which are losing between 1.5% to 5% of their base each year.
Roku’s ARPUs Are Not Comparable With Pay TV Players
Roku’s platform ARPUs are a fraction of major pay-TV players, since it mostly accounts for content sales on a net basis, with its ad loads also coming in below linear TV.
That said, the metric should improve further with the introduction of premium channels earlier this year and better monetization of ad inventory.
Estimating Roku’s Platform Revenues
Roku’s platform revenues have expanded from around $100 million in 2016 to about $420 million in 2018.
We expect the metric to grow to about $700 million by 2019.
Estimating Roku’s Total Revenues
Roku’s total revenues are expected to rise to about $1 billion this year, driven by the platform business, although the Players (hardware) operations should also see modest growth.
Estimating Roku’s Valuation
We are valuing Roku at about 11x projected 2019 revenues.
Arriving At A Price Estimate For Roku
This translates into a price estimate of about $104 per share, which is slightly ahead of the current market price.

Just like a Fire TV Stick, the included remote works with Alexa voice commands to pick shows, search titles, control volume, and more.
Regularly $430, you can save $130.01 and get it for $299.99.

Kim Kardashian West and President Donald Trump have a new plan to help former inmates tackle unemployment, one of the largest obstacles to their reentry to civilian life.
Their plan: a new partnership with ride-share giant Lyft that would provide formerly incarcerated people with gift cards for transportation to job interviews, work, and family visits.
In a surprise appearance, Kardashian West announced the program Thursday at a White House event that promoted giving former inmates “a second chance at success.”
Proud to partner on this initiative with @Lyft, a company with a history of taking bold action to do what’s right for our community. Thank you for providing ride share credits to formally incarcerated people when they come home. — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 13, 2019
“Everyone wants the community to be safe, and the more opportunity we have and that they have and the support that we help give them, the safer everyone will be,” she said.
The second-chance hiring initiative follows Trump’s success with the First Step Act, legislation that was passed last year to expand job training and reduce sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.
During the speech, Kardashian West said she talked with several people released due to the First Step Act, according to Entertainment Tonight. After hearing the obstacles they faced when looking for new job opportunities, she said she was inspired to find ways to help out.
Neither Trump nor Kardashian West offered details about the ride-share program, but Trump said it — and other steps to facilitate “second-chance hiring” — would help lead to “safe communities, a stronger workforce, and a thriving economy.
“The unemployment rate for former inmates is up to five times higher than the national average,” he said. “My administration has set an ambitious goal: We want to cut the unemployment rate for these individuals to single digits within five years. And we think there’s a really good chance of doing it.”
It remains to be seen if the White House’s push for second-chance hiring will actually be able to achieve that goal, but it’s certainly an issue that’s got two of the country’s most prominent figures paying attention.
The high unemployment rate among former inmates makes reentry to civilian life more difficult
There’s a reason why both Kardashian West and the White House are pushing businesses to hire more former inmates: unemployment rates for ex-felons are incredibly high and undermine successful transitions into civilian life.
According to a 2018 Prison Policy Initiative report, the unemployment rate for the five million former inmates in the US was 27 percent — a stark contrast to the 5.8 percent of the general public.
And as PPI noted, discrimination is a clear factor: Having a criminal record reduces callback rates by 50 percent. Different demographics experience those barriers to varying degrees: Black women experience the highest levels of unemployment at 43.6 percent, while white men experience the lowest levels at 18.4 percent. And even when they do find jobs, the majority of former inmates that are employed receive an income that is well below the poverty line.
But finding employment is one of the crucial factors to ensuring formerly incarcerated people reintegrate into society: A study for the University of Missouri found that recidivism rates dropped by more than 33 percent for inmates who acquired a GED and found a full-time job after release.
The reality TV star is now a serious — and successful — advocate for criminal justice reform
Kardashian West isn’t new to advocating for inmates: She first met with Trump in May 2018 to discuss criminal justice reform when lobbying for the release of Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense. The president granted Johnson clemency shortly after that meeting.
She was then invited to the Oval Office along with Jared Kushner and former Obama administration official Van Jones on September 5, 2018, to help persuade Trump to pass the First Step Act, according to CNN. Although Trump had shown reluctance to supporting the act, Kardashian West said she encouraged him by reminding him of Johnson’s success. Trump ultimately signed the act in December 2018.
Since then, Kardashian West has stood by her commitments to criminal justice reform. Following the passage of the First Step Act, she helped fund the 90 Days of Freedom Campaign: Over the span of 90 days, that organization helped represent inmates that could petition for lower sentences under the act and freed 17 first-time nonviolent drug offenders. She also helped those people travel back to their families following their release.
And it seems to be far from a passing interest.
Kardashian West has also revealed she’s taking matters into her own hands by preparing to be a lawyer, according to Vogue. She is currently undergoing a four-year apprenticeship with a San Francisco law firm in preparation for the California bar exam in 2022. Kardashian West said she was motivated to professionally train herself while lobbying for Johnson. As she sat in the Roosevelt Room with “a lot of really powerful people” to talk about changing the clemency system, she said she realized she needed to know more to become a better advocate.
”One person actually said I should ‘stay in my lane.’ I want people to understand that there is nothing that should limit your pursuit of your dreams, and the accomplishment of new goals,” Kardashian West wrote on Instagram. “You can create your own lanes, just as I am.”

We have initiated coverage for streaming media player maker Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU). The company has been) growing fast, driven primarily by its digital platform business, which makes money by selling advertisements and distributing streaming content. However, the company remains loss-making, on account of its high operating expenses and the declining margins on its hardware. In this analysis, we break down Roku’s key revenues and operating expenses and look at when the company could reach operating break-even.
View our interactive dashboard analysis on When Will Roku Break Even? You can modify our key forecasts to arrive at your own estimates for Roku’s potential operating break-even. In addition, you can view more data for Technology Companies.
Step 1: Estimating Platform Revenues
Roku’s platform revenues have grown from around $100 million in 2016 to about $420 million in 2018, driven by a soaring user base and higher monetization via ads and content sales.
We expect the metric to grow to close to $700 million in 2019 (about 65% of total revenues) and to about $ 1 billion by 2020.
Step 2: Calculating Players Revenues
Roku’s players division, which sells its streaming hardware, has seen sales rise from around $294 million to about $326 million, driven by lower-priced models.
We expect the metric to grow to about $360 million by 2020.
Step 3: Estimating Platform Gross Profits
We expect Roku’s platform gross margins to trend lower, due to:
A higher mix of video ads, which have lower margins.
Introduction of premium subscriptions, which will be accounted for on a gross basis.
Step 4: Estimating Players Gross Profits
Players gross margins could also trend lower, as Roku looks to sell more players at lower prices to get customers onto its platform.
Step 5: Estimating Roku’s Operating Expenses
While total operating expenses have grown at ~40% CAGR over the last 3 years, we expect to see slightly lower growth going forward.
We Estimate That Roku Could Reach Operating Break-even By 2020
While we expect the company to post an operating loss in 2019, it could potentially break even in 2020.

(TNS) — In half a dozen states, including the most populous state of California, the Real ID rollout is a real mess.
Technical glitches, delays and miscommunication are roiling the Real ID implementation in those states, calling into question whether residents will have the secure driver’s license needed to travel by air or enter government-restricted areas after October 2020.
In California and Maryland, miscommunication between the state motor vehicle departments and the federal Department of Homeland Security about which documents are required to prove residency have sent the states and residents scrambling to recertify Real IDs that were already issued but are no longer valid.
A handful of other states initially delayed implementation by passing laws saying they would not comply for various reasons, from privacy concerns to objections to federal mandates. DHS granted those states more time but is refusing further extensions — and has warned states that if they don’t comply, their residents will need passports to board planes. That brought those states on board, but they are running behind in their efforts.
Some of the states are shifting resources to the problem, finding they must hire more personnel and spend extra money to comply by the deadline.
DHS has postponed the original deadline of 2008 many times since the Real ID law was enacted in 2005, but the department says it has no plans to extend the Oct. 1, 2020, deadline.
After that date, only driver’s licenses that meet the Real ID security standards can be used to board commercial airline fights or enter a secure federal building such as a military base. The Real ID Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, requires licenses to be marked with a special insignia or star, indicating that holders have gone through extra steps to prove their identity.
In general, that requires identification documents, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate (for name changes) and original Social Security card, plus two proofs of residency in that state, such as credit card or utility bills, vehicle registration or a bank statement.
A Real ID will not be required to drive a car, so anyone not planning air travel or to enter a secure federal building will not need one. But people lacking the ID who want to board a plane would have to bring another valid document, such as a passport or global entry card.
TSA, which secures U.S. airports, anticipates some confusion come October 2020.
Lisa Farbstein, a spokeswoman for the TSA, envisioned a future traveler with nonrefundable plane tickets:
“They step up to the TSA checking station, and if they don’t have a Real ID, the officer is going to say, ‘I’m sorry, this ID is no longer valid,’” Farbstein said. “There is somebody who is between a rock and a hard place.”
While that person may plead with their airline, she added, TSA won’t budge. “That’s why it’s important to do this sooner rather than later,” she said. “TSA knows a thing or two about what people think about waiting in lines.”
In addition to Real IDs, some states along the northern and southern borders are offering an “enhanced” driver’s license, which allows freer passage between the United States and Canada or Mexico. That, too, will work for getting on a plane. The enhanced driver’s licenses are offered in only a few states to only U.S. citizens.
While TSA is putting out public service announcements about the new IDs, notices at the state level vary.
Maryland began complying with the Real ID law in 2009, requiring new residents or those getting licenses for the first time to provide extra documentation “under a process that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security deemed compliant,” according to Charles Brown, spokesman for the Maryland Department of Transportation and the state Motor Vehicle Administration.
That process required proof of residency and proof of identity, such as Social Security cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates or other identification. The state started issuing Real ID license renewals in 2016. “However, in October 2017, DHS informed Maryland that all customers with a driver’s license or identification card containing the Real ID star, which we began issuing in 2016, must have documents on file” with the departments, Brown said in an email.
As a result, 1 million residents who held the Real ID card had to make a return trip to the MVA so that the state could put copies of their proof of identification and residency on file. The state is scheduling them in groups.
The federal Department of Homeland Security refused to comment on the situation in Maryland and other states, despite repeated requests.
More than 2 million of Maryland’s 5 million licensed drivers are Real ID compliant, Brown said. For customers, Maryland is extending hours at MVA offices, opening satellite offices, allowing customers to set up appointments and pledging that the process will take only 15 minutes if an appointment is made. A recent trip to an MVA office in Beltsville revealed long lines but a sense of urgency by staff members to adhere to the 15-minute time frame.
In notices to Maryland divers, the state threatened that failing to meet the new requirements would “result in a recall of your Maryland driver’s license or identification card.” Many residents scrambled to comply.
California, with more than 26 million drivers, faced a similar problem. California DMV spokesman Jaime Garza also blamed changing DHS standards for creating the mess.
“The US Department of Homeland Security unexpectedly changed its originally approved method by which the CA DMV collected two proofs of residency,” Garza wrote in an email. “CA had followed the same DHS approved method that the state of Wisconsin was using to collect two proofs residency.”
The approved Wisconsin procedure would have allowed residents to respond to a letter from the DMV with a “return receipt requested” designation, sending in one proof of residency, with the mailing itself counting as the second proof. Garza provided Stateline with a 2017 letter from DHS official Steve Yonkers, director of the Real ID program, to the Wisconsin DMV approving that process. California based its procedure on the Wisconsin procedure, with DHS’s approval, Garza said. But Wisconsin ultimately went with in-person applications.
But a DHS letter to California in November 2018 reversed that directive, Garza said, saying the process “does not comply” with the Real ID law. That threw the state into a tizzy, he said.
Now, California is sending letters to all residents who provided only one proof of residency, asking them to sign, date and return the letter in a prepaid envelope as a second proof that was not required the first time. Unlike Maryland, California is not requiring drivers to make a return trip to the DMV. “The goal was to make this process as easy and convenient as possible for Californians,” Garza said, noting that it affects 3.6 million Californians holding Real IDs.
But the state has had a big increase in residents crowding into DMVs because of the confusion. Like Maryland, Garza said, California has increased office hours and hired 2,000 additional employees.
Some states are lagging in issuing Real IDs in part because they fought the idea from the beginning. Seventeen states passed laws restricting or banning its implementation.
Those states get little sympathy from Republican U.S. Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, author of the 2005 law.
“The Real ID Act was a key recommendation of the 9-11 Commission to protect Americans from another devastating act of terrorism,” he said in an email. “States have had more than 14 years to comply with the law, and the Department of Homeland Security has provided additional funding to help along the way.”
Much of the opposition came from tea party Republicans who excoriated the Real ID law as an attack on privacy.
Scott Hofstra, chairman of the Central Kentucky Tea Party Patriots, said in a phone interview that his group is worried the federal bureaucrats at the top of DHS could get all kinds of information on cardholders, including medical and criminal histories.
“It takes away a lot of our privacy on the state level and gives it to the Department of Homeland Security,” Hofstra said. “The head of the DHS could tell the state, ‘I want you to list all their medical records on their driver’s license, or criminal records on their driver’s license.’ That’s from one unelected bureaucrat.”
Hofstra, an aircraft maintenance supervisor from Vine Grove, Kentucky, said he will get a Real ID only if his job requires it. To fly, he will use a passport.
Opposition also came from liberal groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, on privacy grounds. The group contended that despite the state-by-state nature of the Real IDs, information would be “consolidated into a national database,” which could be used to track individuals.
The ACLU sued to block implementation of Real ID in New Jersey. The state settled with the group in 2012, agreeing to open the process to comment and suggestions from the public about implementation procedures. The rollout was delayed.
“In 2018, we were really far behind,” said B. Sue Fulton, chief administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, in a phone interview. “We were not ready for the customer volume that would be generated by implementing Real ID.”
In response, she said, the state hired 300 new full-time employees and revamped its licensing software, equipment, online services and procedures. Now, she thinks the state will have fulfilled the requirements by October next year and avoid some of the problems faced in other states, even those that started earlier.
“What gives me the confidence is that we learned so much from other states,” she said. “We shouldn’t have to backtrack, which some of the states had to do.”
Kentucky, one of the states that resisted the law because of opposition from the tea party and other privacy advocates, is just now starting the Real ID process, with new licenses expected in January 2020.
In 2016, the Kentucky legislature passed legislation requiring the Real ID process to start. Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, vetoed it, saying “it has become increasingly clear that there is tremendous opposition and misunderstanding about the bill.”
After getting a federal extension, Kentucky again passed the legislation in 2017. Bevin, to spare Kentuckians from having to carry a passport to fly after their regular license stops working at airports, finally signed it.
Kentucky Transportation Cabinet spokeswoman Naitore Djigbenou said in a phone interview that it would take two years to get Real IDs to everyone who wants one. Nonetheless, she said she was confident that all Kentuckians who want the compliant license will be able to get one before the deadline.
“We are offering two options: a Real ID or a noncompliant card. Some prefer to use a passport to continue to fly,” she said. “This is completely voluntary. It’s not a requirement by any means.”
But Americans aren’t used to carrying a passport when traveling, according to Wayne Sandford, a University of New Haven professor of homeland security and emergency management and a former deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
He said states that started issuing Real IDs early mostly have fewer problems. “The states that said, ‘Nah, we’re not doing it, don’t worry about it, it will never be real’ are in trouble.
“Now they realize their residents in their states need to have this done or carry a passport. For Americans this would be a really strange request. It’s not like it’s Europe where every country is a state, essentially.”
Sandford speculated that once this initial period of uncertainty and bureaucratic snafus passes, Americans will be pleased with how easily the new licenses allow them to travel. And he pooh-poohs privacy concerns.
Asked if he had privacy concerns, he said in a phone interview, “being from the other side and working in homeland security at the state level, I would say no, I don’t.” His years of working on homeland security issues, he said, have persuaded him that the goal is smooth travel, not invasions of privacy.
“I think it will actually make travel easier.”

This post was created by the Contributor in partnership with BestBlackFriday.com, which specializes in holiday season sales. The deals highlighted within this post were independently selected and do not contain affiliate links.
As Black Friday 2018 approaches, doubts emerge: Will there be a better deal on Cyber Monday? Since this sales holiday is growing even faster than Black Friday, that’s a valid question. So do you wait? When it comes to Best Buy (52-page Black Friday ad scan), we have a very good idea…
This is the second in my Cyber Monday 2018 preview series, following my Walmart Cyber Monday Preview. For this series, I am working with BestBlackFriday.com and will preview all the major stores, including Amazon (Black Friday ad here) and Target (Black Friday ad here) as well as guides to Apple and Samsung products.
Best Buy
The best method for forecasting Best Buy’s Cyber Monday 2018 sales is to analyse its 16-page Cyber Monday ad aggregated by BestBlackFriday.com and posted on November 26th last year. These were the top deals:
So what can we learn from this about Best Buy’s Cyber Monday 2018 sales?
For starters, Best Buy offered free standard shipping on all orders last year as detailed in its Cyber Monday ad scan. For 2018, Best Buy will once again offer free standard shipping on all orders.
Nintendo
Next is Best Buy’s Cyber Monday 2018 ad scan date. I understand it will come out on either Saturday, November 24 or Sunday, November 25. As for deals, don’t worry too much if you miss out on Black Friday offers, many of the top deals will be repeated. That said, in-store only Black Friday deals like the Toshiba 43-inch Class LED 2160p Smart 4K UHD TV with HDR Fire TV Edition for $129.99 (save $200) (See Ad Scan Deal) and Sharp 55-inch Class LED 2160p Smart 4K UHD TV with HDR Roku TV for $249.99 (save $200) (See Ad Scan Deal) are unlikely to be repeated.
Here are the deals I believe you will see again with Best Buy’s Cyber Monday 2018 sale:
These are all solid deals, though Walmart has bigger iPhone and Galaxy discounts. Walmart is also like to introduce perhaps the only PlayStation 4 Pro deal. Kohl’s Cash coupon deals also give it a major advantage on console deals.

If you are the sort of person who needs a credit card having a maximum limit of €50,000, then you could probably benefit from some other services, like a concierge service to deal with your hotel and restaurant bookings, for example, all of which will be automatically charged to your card.
This is just one benefit of the Insignia Platinum card to be launched in the coming months – but it is actually just the tip of what could be a much larger iceberg.
Insignia Cards commenced operations in 2011 and launched its first product locally a few months ago, with considerably more fanfare than one would anticipate for a local card, which was co-branded with Valletta FC.
To understand this, you have to take into account that its roots lie with Insignia Lifestyle, an international firm set up in 1995 to provide lifestyle management services for the high net worth individuals.
It provided credit cards through a third party bank, but it wanted to be able to issue its own and looked to the Maltese jurisdiction as the ideal one.
It eventually got a licence from the Malta Financial Services Authority and has also been accepted as a Visa issuer to issue credit cards. But the reality is that the considerable investment required to operate a credit card infrastructure – including a 24/7 call centre – justifies a much larger market and Insignia is applying to the MFSA to be able to use its Maltese licence to issue credit cards across the EU.
And while they were working on the international expansion, they thought they might as well offer a card to the local market – and decided to issue the Yes Money Card, the Yes Money Visa and the Yes e-Card, as well as to co-brand an Insignia card with Valletta FC, the first cards in Malta which are not issued by a bank.
“Credit cards issued by local banks are usually a secondary product compared to their main banking products, thus are not marketed as actively as ours. For us credit cards are our principal activity,” CEO Frederick Ellul said, explaining the higher emphasis on benefits.
The lower limit card was co-branded with Lighthouse’s Yes brand, which is looking after its marketing through its various consumer products like its door-to-door publication and its TV programme.
The success of both cards has prompted Insignia to plan the Insignia Platinum card, which offers a maximum credit limit of €50,000, a niche, which is not really being catered for by other local cards.
“People who have that sort of turnover on their card are the ones who are constantly travelling. So the concierge services will be invaluable to them,” Dr Ellul said.
From using Malta to issue credit cards, to using Malta’s EU credentials to passport the licence overseas, to issuing local cards, what is next?
Dr Ellul’s eyes twinkled.
“We are also open to other opportunities that crop up over the coming years but the common thread through any expansion would be retaining the focus on high net worth individuals.
“And if there are any other football clubs – anywhere in Europe – who want to co-brand with Insignia once we get passporting rights, well, you know where we are!”

Justin Verlander Rookie Card Rankings and Countdown Share:

If you’re looking for a Justin Verlander Rookie Card, you’ve got lots to choose from — like more than 40 of them. He made his hobby debut at a time when four companies had MLB licenses — Topps, Upper Deck, Donruss/Playoff and Fleer. So not only does that mean a lot of choices, but each company has their own sort of niche.
Despite a Hall of Fame résumé that’s bringing with it some major career milestones of late, you don’t have to spend a lot to get most of Verlander’s Rookie Cards. The majority are regular cards and not autographs or numbered short prints. Those exist, but you can put together an extensive collection and still avoid them.
The autograph Justin Verlander Rookie Card lineup consists of 15 cards and are spread across all four companies.
In most instances, it takes a lot for a pitcher to pop in the hobby. Most play just once or twice a week. Many get injured. And even for those who stay healthy, there’s usually a small window of dominance. While Verlander has had his ups and downs, he is easily one of the best of his generation. Not only did he win the 2011 American League Cy Young Award, he took home the MVP Award as well, something pitchers rarely do.
The 2017 World Series Champion is on the backend of his career. Still, he remains among the best starters in baseball. What you’re likely to start hearing more of as things wind down are his career numbers and debates about where he stands among the greats. With that in mind, he’s no longer a “risk” when it comes to baseball cards. His place in history is set.
New Rules, Not New Rookie Cards
As if 45 RCs wasn’t enough to digest, there’s another layer to consider with Justin Verlander Rookie Cards. Starting in 2006, the MLBPA and MLB went to a more strict definition for what they considered to be a Rookie Card. Specifically it went by debut. In the process, it introduced when they see as their current standard, complete with Rookie Card badges.
By making his debut in July, 2005, that made Verlander “eligible” for the new MLBPA rookie rules. So, many of his 2006 cards have that new designation logo. But these aren’t considered RCs in the traditional sense. Verlander has plenty of 2005 base cards that are considered his Rookies.
Verlander isn’t alone with this logo crossover confusion. The first few years of these new rules meant a lot of transition. Before these rules were put into place, draft picks and prospects could make their way into base sets and be RCs. So those that did prior to the change often have a year where their actual RCs and the logo don’t match up.
In short, Justin Verlander Rookie Cards are all 2005 cards, not 2006.

Real ID, real problems: States cope with changing rules, late rollouts
In half a dozen states, including the most populous state of California, the Real ID rollout is a real mess.
Technical glitches, delays and miscommunication are roiling the Real ID implementation in those states, calling into question whether residents will have the secure driver’s license needed to travel by air or enter government restricted areas after October 2020.
In California and Maryland, miscommunication between the state motor vehicle departments and the federal Department of Homeland Security about which documents are required to prove residency have sent the states and residents scrambling to recertify Real IDs that were already issued but are no longer valid.
A handful of other states initially delayed implementation by passing laws saying they would not comply for various reasons, from privacy concerns to objections to federal mandates. DHS granted those states more time but is refusing further extensions -- and has warned states that if they don’t comply, their residents will need passports to board planes. That brought those states on board, but they are running behind in their efforts.
Some of the states are shifting resources to the problem, finding they must hire more personnel and spend extra money to comply by the deadline.
DHS has postponed the original deadline of 2008 many times since the Real ID law was enacted in 2005, but the department says it has no plans to extend the Oct. 1, 2020, deadline.
After that date, only driver’s licenses that meet the Real ID security standards can be used to board commercial airline fights or enter a secure federal building such as a military base. The Real ID Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, requires licenses to be marked with a special insignia or star, indicating that holders have gone through extra steps to prove their identity.
In general, that requires identification documents, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate (for name changes) and original Social Security card, plus two proofs of residency in that state, such as credit card or utility bills, vehicle registration or a bank statement.
A Real ID will not be required to drive a car, so anyone not planning air travel or to enter a secure federal building will not need one. But people lacking the ID who want to board a plane would have to bring another valid document, such as a passport or global entry card.
The Transportation Security Administration, which secures U.S. airports, anticipates some confusion come October 2020.
Lisa Farbstein, a spokeswoman for the TSA, envisioned a future traveler with nonrefundable plane tickets:
“They step up to the TSA checking station, and if they don’t have a Real ID, the officer is going to say, ‘I’m sorry, this ID is no longer valid,’” Farbstein said. “There is somebody who is between a rock and a hard place.”
While that person may plead with their airline, she added, TSA won’t budge. “That’s why it’s important to do this sooner rather than later,” she said. “TSA knows a thing or two about what people think about waiting in lines.”
In addition to Real IDs, some states along the northern and southern borders are offering an “enhanced” driver’s license, which allows freer passage between the United States and Canada or Mexico. That, too, will work for getting on a plane. The enhanced driver’s licenses are offered in only a few states to only U.S. citizens.
While TSA is putting out public service announcements about the new IDs, notices at the state level vary.
States scrambling
Maryland began complying with the Real ID law in 2009, requiring new residents or those getting licenses for the first time to provide extra documentation “under a process that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security deemed compliant,” according to Charles Brown, spokesman for the Maryland Department of Transportation and the state Motor Vehicle Administration.
That process required proof of residency and proof of identity, such as Social Security cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates or other identification. The state started issuing Real ID license renewals in 2016. “However, in October 2017, DHS informed Maryland that all customers with a driver’s license or identification card containing the Real ID star, which we began issuing in 2016, must have documents on file” with the departments, Brown said in an email.
As a result, 1 million residents who held the Real ID card had to make a return trip to the MVA so that the state could put copies of their proof of identification and residency on file. The state is scheduling them in groups.
The federal Department of Homeland Security refused to comment on the situation in Maryland and other states, despite repeated requests.
More than 2 million of Maryland’s 5 million licensed drivers are Real ID compliant, Brown said. For customers, Maryland is extending hours at MVA offices, opening satellite offices, allowing customers to set up appointments and pledging that the process will take only 15 minutes if an appointment is made. A recent trip to an MVA office in Beltsville revealed long lines but a sense of urgency by staff members to adhere to the 15-minute time frame.
In notices to Maryland divers, the state threatened that failing to meet the new requirements would “result in a recall of your Maryland driver’s license or identification card.” Many residents scrambled to comply.
California, with more than 26 million drivers, faced a similar problem. California DMV spokesman Jaime Garza also blamed changing DHS standards for creating the mess.

Story 48
While the Galaxy Note series is always one of the largest phones released in any given year, the 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display on the Galaxy Note 10 Plus is enormous, even in a world with many other supersized phones. But big doesn’t always mean strong, and the beautiful glass back on the Note 10 Plus won’t stay good-looking for long if it takes a tumble and suffers at the hands of your local concrete.
For the love of Samsung, protect it. The Note 10 Plus starts from a heady $1,100 — are you really going to balk at buying a little protection? Here are some of the best protective cases you can buy to keep your Galaxy Note 10 Plus and Note 10 Plus 5G in fighting shape for longer.
Tech21 Pure Clear case
You didn’t buy the $1,000 Aura Glow Note 10 Plus just to hide it away, but at the same time, that beauty deserves protection. Tech21’s Pure Clear case gives you all the protection you need, while allowing the Note 10 Plus to shine. It’s made from flexible but tough TPU that provides good protection while also being completely clear. It’s drop resistant up to 12 feet (3.6 meters), has built-in anti-microbial protection, a self-healing finish, and is made from sustainable materials. The sides of the case have ridges for extra grip, and there’s a raised bezel around the camera lenses to keep it safe. On the minus side, $40 is expensive, but this completely clear protection is worth paying for.
Speck Presidio Grip case
Glass phones are slippery, and massive ones can be unwieldy. The Note 10 Plus is a huge glass phone, so the problem is doubled down. Stop your Note 10 Plus from slipping from your grasp with Speck’s Presidio Grip. Those raised parallel lines are Speck’s signature, and they offer a boost in grip, ensuring you can keep a solid hold on your phone. If you do drop your phone, don’t worry, it’s still well protected. The Presidio Grip has a double layer construction that includes Impactium cushioning to further bolster against drops. It also has anti-microbial properties, while a raised bezel ensures your phone doesn’t rest directly on surfaces. Some may balk at a $45 price tag — and we don’t blame them — but Speck’s reputation, much like this case, is extremely solid.
Scooch Wingman case
Scooch’s Wingman is the case we never knew we needed until we saw it. While it’s initially odd looking, that strange style has its purposes. The flexible band on the back of the Wingman can be used as a horizontal or vertical stand, a fingergrip, or even a car vent mount, making it one of the most immediately useful cases around. It’s also protective, and uses Exo-D corner airbags to protect your phone from drops. It’s so tough, it meets military standards for drop tests. It’s also clear, letting you show off your Note 10 Plus. It doesn’t have much style, and it’s not as slim as it could be thanks to the band on the back, but it more than makes up for it with its usefulness.
Burkley Bi-fold Magnetic Detachable Wallet case
We love wallet cases, but most tend to lean toward being a case, rather than being a wallet, sporting three card slots at most. If you have a lot of cards to cart around, then look no further than Burkley’s bi-fold wallet case. It comes with a staggering 11 card pockets, a single visible card slot, and two cash pockets, as well as a magnetically attached phone case. It’s made from 100% full-grain leather for maximum luxury and style, and the phone case can be pulled away from the wallet if required. It’s the perfect “hub” to help keep everything you need together. But this look and quality doesn’t come cheap, and all that leather is going to cost you.
Spigen Slim Armor CS
We rarely miss recommending a Spigen case, and for the Note 10 Plus we’re recommending the Slim Armor CS. It’s one of Spigen’s slimmest cases, but it still offers strong protection against a variety of threats. It uses a combination of TPU and polycarbonate for a great mix of hard and soft protection, while Spigen’s Air Cushion technology reinforces it against drops. But it’s not just about protection. Slide the back panel and you’ll find space for two cards, spare cash, or anything else that’ll fit there. It’s slim enough to slip easily into a pocket while being protective enough to guard against most daily hazards. At $16, this is a steal.
Poetic Revolution case
Rugged cases tend to come on the expensive side, but they don’t have to. Poetic specializes in providing the latter. The Revolution is one of our favorite cheap rugged cases, and it’s easy to see why. It’s made from a shock-resistant TPU core with a hard polycarbonate backplate, providing strong protection against drops, scratches, bumps, and more. There’s a built-in kickstand on the back, and raised bezels make sure your phone doesn’t rest on surfaces, preventing it from picking up scratches from dirt and grit. However, it’s certainly a bulky case, and anyone looking for a stylish case that complements the Note 10 Plus’s sleek look should skip this over. But it’s still a must-buy for some.
Ringke Fusion-X case
Looking for a unique style? Ringke’s Fusion-X case is a veteran of smartphone protection, and it’s certainly a case that stands out. It’s made from a hard polycarbonate backplate with a TPU bumper around the edges that helps to reduce the impact from drops and bumps. That hard backplate resists scratches, and it’s also completely clear, so you don’t have to hide your Note 10 Plus away. It’s compatible with Ringke’s Dual Easy screen protector from our best Note 10 Plus screen protectors list, and it even has a lanyard attachment point. The looks are likely to be what turns you off, but if that’s not a problem for you, then you’ll love this case.
LifeProof Next case
If you’re an active person, then you need protection that matches your life. LifeProof’s cases do exactly what they say on the tin, adding loads of outdoor resistance to your Note 10 Plus. The LifeProof Next case has drop-resistance up to two meters and sports extra resistance against snow and dirt. There are plugs for each of the ports, speakers, and the microphone, ensuring there’s no ingress into your device. It’s transparent so you can admire your phone, and it’s pretty slim for a rugged case. An active case for an active user, the Next doesn’t come cheap at $80. But if you can afford it, then there are few cases more protective.
UAG Monarch case
With one of the most iconic styles in case protection, how could we not include the UAG Monarch? It’s hand-crafted from fine grain leather laid over an alloy metal frame, combined with an impact-resistant core and a traction grip on the outside edges to boost grip. It’s so protective it meets military standards for drop protection twice over, and even comes with a 10-year guarantee. We doubt you’ll be using your Note 10 Plus in 10 years, but it’s certainly a statement of reliability. Oversized tactile buttons mean the protection doesn’t interfere with your use. There are issues; it’s expensive, and it adds bulk to an already large phone, but it’s still excellent.
Otterbox Defender case
For the ultimate in everyday protection, you can go wrong with the Otterbox Defender. A hard outer shell combines with a shock-resisting inner core to provide excellent all-around protection, while port covers make sure small particles don’t find their way into your phone. There’s a holster with a belt clip that can be attached, while raised bezels ensure your device doesn’t rest on dirty surfaces. It’s lacking in overt style, but it also doesn’t sport the extremely rugged looks other protective cases go for — which makes it perfect for everyday use when you don’t want to scream about how protective your case is. The $60 price may also put you off, but if you can justify it, it’s a great investment.
Incipio Tran5form 5G-compatible case
Looking for slim drop protection? Then you’ve come to the right place. Incipio is well known for providing thin and lightweight cases that protect well in spite of their slim builds — and now Incipio is offering a strong and light case that’s been engineered to work with 5G wavebands. Thin enough to provide a window through to your device’s good looks, the Tran5form case provides support for both high- and low-frequency 5G bands. Even with that slim build, it’s supremely protective and provides drop-protection from falls of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters). It looks good and it’s extremely protective — so what’s the downside? It’s a little expensive at $40.
Kate Spade New York Scattered Flowers case
The Note 10 Plus is already a stunning phone, but you can always add a little more style. This case comes from the extremely fashionable Kate Spade New York brand, and decorates your phone with a collection of black and white scattered flowers laid over a completely clear case. The effect is striking, and if you think your phone needs a little more pizzazz, then this might be a good choice. It’s protective too, with a flexible hard shell that resists scratches, dents, and protects against damage from drops. It’s fully compatible with Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband, making it a good choice for the Note 10 Plus 5G. It’s expensive at $50, though.
Olixar NovaShield case
Protective cases can sometimes be large, bulky, and — in the worst cases — quite ugly. Not so here. Olixar’s NovaShield uses a flexible and absorbent TPU bumper with a hard PC back panel to resist a variety of damage. Airbags in the TPU bumper fortify the phone against drops, and a raised edge protects the screen, while the hard PC panel will prove especially effective against scratches. The back panel is also completely clear, which means you don’t feel cut off from the Note 10 Plus’s good looks. At just $14, it’s also a bargain. The black bumper edgings won’t be to everyone’s tastes certainly, but it’s a good case regardless.
VRS Designs Genuine Leather Diary case
No material screams “premium” quite like genuine leather, and if you want that feeling for your Note 10 Plus, check out VRS Designs’ Diary case. It’s made from premium, genuine leather with a hard inner case that holds your phone tightly. The front cover folds around your screen and provides protection while you’re not using your phone, and it neatly folds back behind your device when you need it out of the way. As a wallet case, there’s also space for three credit cards or some spare cash. However, expect to pay a lot of money for that utility and style — the price comes in at a hefty $70.
Armor-X BX-series case
Protection is all very well and good, but versatility is also extremely valuable. Armor-X ensures you don’t have to pick between the two. This case is made from a dual-layer construction that uses a TPU frame with a hard PC back panel to protect against drops and scratches, all without increasing the bulk of your sleek phone. But you can find that in many other cases too, so what’s unique here? The X-mount, that’s what. The BX-series case comes with a carabiner and a grip strap to help hold and store your phone — but the integrated X-mount also has support for Armor-X’s bike mount, armband clip, car mount, and more. While you’ll need to fork out for those extra mounts, it’s clear the BX-series is a case designed for a wide variety of people with active lifestyles. At $25 for the basic package, it’s an absolute steal.

MARINE CORPS AIR STATION IWAKUNI, Japan — Some junior Marines in Japan have shredded their meal cards and moved to a simpler system that requires only a common access card, or CAC, to dine at mess halls.
Part of a Marine Corps-wide initiative, the change eliminates an unnecessary piece of paper that can easily be lost or forged, said Chief Warrant Officer 4 Denis Lebreton, director of the Installation Personnel Administration Center, which oversees dining facilities at MCAS Iwakuni.
The CAC system increases accountability and reduces the administrative burden of managing the program, he said. For example, Marines who lost their meal card were required to fill out a statement that had to be routed through their chain of command, the provost marshal office and the mess hall.
Using CACs also eliminates the ability for Marines to loan their meal card to another individual or make a copy that could then be used by someone else, Lebreton said.
The new system has been up and running for months; however, IPAC just recently received official word from the Marines to stop issuing meal cards at Iwakuni, he said.
Marines were instructed to shred their meal cards last month, prompting rumors that they would be put on a basic allowance for subsistence, or BAS.
Lebreton said that is not the case; however, the change should also benefit Marines on BAS, because they will no longer be required to use cash to purchase a meal. Instead, the cost will automatically be deducted from their BAS and reflected on their leave and earnings statement at the end of the month.
Marines receiving BAS can still use cash, but there is now an option if they forget to bring money with them, he said.
The change does not affect members of other services stationed at Iwakuni or other Marine installations, Lebreton said. Sailors based at Iwakuni still need to use a meal card to dine at the mess hall, and servicemembers receiving BAS will have to show their ID and pay cash at the register.
Marines assigned to bases owned by a different service will have to follow requirements at that installation.

There was a time in history when a Buick station wagon was the quite literally the master of the road. So much so in fact that Buick called it the Roadmaster. But somewhere along the way, American car buyers fell out of love with wagons and then later it seems, with cars entirely. Thus when Buick announced the latest generation of the long running Regal nameplate, the two variants were badged as the Sportback and TourX. The latter is a Regal station wagon in all but name and anyone that likes driving but needs some added utility, should really be taking a serious look that this machine.
When planning for the launch of the launch of the latest Regal, Buick product planners clearly saw that brands such as Subaru, Volvo and Audi had achieved a measure of success by hiking up wagons by an inch or so and applying some wheel arch extensions and calling them crossovers. Sadly, based on sales figures, people going into Buick showrooms don’t seem to buying into the whole TourX as crossover charade. Through the first nine months of 2018, only about 11,000 Regals were sold, an improvement over the 2017 generational transition year but still well behind the LaCrosse which is about to be axed.
Sam Abuelsamid
Given that the U.S.-market Regal is imported from Germany and built by Opel which is no longer part of GM since being sold off to PSA a couple of years ago, it seems likely that unless sales pick up dramatically in the near future, this model’s days are probably numbered. Buick also makes Regals in China, but the trade tensions between the current administration and Beijing makes that an unlikely alternate source.
The TourX sits on the same 111.4-inch wheelbase as the Sportback but carries an extra 3.4-inches of bodywork behind the rear axle. Combined with a roof that extends straight back rather than sloping down, it offers considerably more space for carrying larger cargo like antiques from an estate sale or a dog crate or two. In general I have long favored midsized station wagons over the equivalent sedans because they add this extra utility without really sacrificing car driving dynamics as a more SUV-like crossovers do.
Since the TourX only gains one-inch in height relative to the sportback, the impact on handling is pretty minimal. Personally I could do without the essentially non-functional wheel arch extensions and front fascia augmentation meant to make this look more like an SUV. I’d be more inclined the get the conventional Opel Insignia wagon which blends the extended roofline with the rest of the Sportback detailing, but its not offensive enough to entirely turn me off.
Sam Abuelsamid
Overall, aside from the faux-SUV details, I’m quite fond of the design of the Regal TourX. I think it has great proportions and remains a very sleek design. The latest iteration of the Buick grille fits in well and the sharper creases give this new Regal a bit more of an upscale presence than the last iteration. Details such as the chrome side-glass trim that extends down and hooks through the taillights appear to hold the roof down.
Sam Abuelsamid
Inside, the dashboard looks more modern and premium than the last generation. The contrast stitching on the leather for the steering wheel, shifter boot and seats is a nice visual touch. The round analog gauges are clear and readable although they lack the configurability of a fully digital cluster like Audi uses. On the other hand, knowing that all the important information will always be in the same place also has benefits.
The infotainment system is straightforward and responsive although the interface is limited to the touchscreen and some voice recognition rather than any sort of central controller for audio, navigation and settings. The screen is bright and sufficiently contrasty for all lighting conditions. A rotary volume knob is centrally located directly under the screen while a panel below that includes physical knobs and switches to manage climate control as all properly designed interiors should.
Sam Abuelsamid
The rear seat offers plenty of room for three adults and 32.7 cubic feet of your stuff will fit between the power tailgate and the seat back. Folding the split rear seats flat more than doubles that volume to 73.5 cubic feet. For comparison, the Envision crossover only offers 57.3 cubic feet of cargo volume with the back seats folded.
Sam Abuelsamid
While the Regal Sportback is offered in either front or all-wheel-drive formats, all TourX wagons get the twin-clutch all-wheel-drive system. Wagons are all powered by GM’s latest 2.0-liter, four-cylinder turbo engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The TourX is about 10-inches longer overall than the Envision, yet at 3,708-pounds, it is 200-pounds lighter than the crossover. Combined with the 259-hp and 295 lb-ft generated by that engine, the performance is more than adequate under all conditions.
Unlike many all-wheel-drive cars (and make no mistake, despite the crossover branding this is a car) which use viscous couplings to direct some torque to the rear axle, the Regal uses a twin-clutch transfer system. This is more efficient and can provide increased power transfer but I occasionally found that under hard acceleration, a bit of a jerk could felt as it engaged. It's possible this was in fact a rough shift, but other vehicles I've driven with this eight speed didn't seem to exhibit this behavior so I'm inclined to attribute it to the transfer mechanism. It wasn't what I'd call particularly objectionable, but it was noticeable.
One of the reasons often given by customers for buying SUVs or crossovers is the ability to tow a trailer. The Envision does offer a modest 1,500-pound tow rating but the Regal doesn’t have any official rating. If you install a hitch, it’s likely to be limited only to carrying a bike rack. Something like the is wagon also isn’t going to be pursuing any Jeep Trailhawk crossovers down off-road trails either, but frankly most buyers never do that either.

After losing our old dog to the ravages of time, my wife and I took the Regal for a road trip across Michigan to procure a new puppy. Over several hours of driving, I can say that this Regal is as excellent a choice for road trips as it is for commuting around town. The radar-based adaptive cruise control makes for smooth and effortless ride in pre-holiday traffic.
Like an increasing number of vehicles today, the Regal was equipped with rear corner radar sensors for blindspot monitoring and cross traffic alert. In general, in a world of parking lots populated with SUVs and big pickups, cross traffic alert is one of my favorite driver assist features. Getting visual and audible alerts when another vehicle is approaching down the aisle while backing out can be extremely handy. However, in the Regal, these alerts didn’t appear until the vehicle triggering the alert was already in my visual range. The blindspot monitor worked better, but I’d like to see Buick take a stab at recalibrating the sensors to improve this functionality.
Sam Abuelsamid
The choice of 18-inch wheels with 235/50R18 tires for the TourX, means it had more sidewall than found on many contemporary vehicles. The benefit of that is some added compliance that along with the strut front and multi-link rear suspension makes for a comfortable ride, even on an unpaved rural road. While this is no Camaro or Corvette, the Regal has able, responsive handling with decent steering feedback. The extra inch of ride height compared to the Sportback doesn’t seem to manifest itself in noticeable body roll.
Over the course of a week including that cross state road trip, the Regal TourX averaged 24.5 mpg, in line with the EPA ratings of 21 mpg city, 29 mpg highway and 24 mpg combined. That’s comparable to the Volvo V60 Cross Country and Audi A4 Allroad and 2 mpg better than the Envision with AWD and the same 2.0-liter turbo engine.
Sam Abuelsamid
The 2019 Regal TourX starts at $30,000 which includes standard AWD. The top Essence trim level starts at $36,000 and my test example went for $42,200 including delivery. Given the slow sales of the Regal, you can probably negotiate a much better deal that could be in the low 30s for a well equipped example. If you don’t need off-roading or towing capability, the Regal TourX is an excellent alternative to taller utilities that anyone that enjoys driving should seriously consider. It’s not a Roadmaster, but it can definitely master the road.

Oceania Cruises
With changes so sweeping that the cruise line calls it a “re-inspiration” rather than a renovation, Oceania Cruises will be making a $100 million dollar investment over the next two years in its four Regatta-Class ships —Regatta, Insignia, Nautica, and Sirena. These changes are part of an ambitious multi-year project that the line has named OceaniaNEXT.
Guests seem to have a real soft spot for these vessels because they feel “right-sized.” Each one holds a maximum of 684-guests, making them large enough to offer appealing amenities (e.g., gracious public spaces and four restaurants) but small enough to maintain a sense of intimacy and provide pampered service.
First built in France about twenty years ago for the now defunct Renaissance Cruises, these four vessels laid the foundation for the birth of Oceania. The cruise line has been operating Regatta, Insignia and Nautica from 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively, and acquired Sirena in 2016. (The company added Marina in 2011 and Riviera the next year, thus creating a six-ship fleet.)
When the Regatta-Class ships emerge from dry-dock, each will have 62 suites and 280 staterooms with spacious interior designs reminiscent of contemporary private residences. They will also be updated with a bevy of technological enhancements (e.g., USB ports, state-of-the-art TV systems with on-demand movies in multiple languages, real-time weather and itinerary updates, etc.).
Forbes.com interviewed Bob Binder, President and CEO of Oceania Cruises, to get the scoop on what changes guests sailing on these ships might expect to see:
What is it that guests seem to love about these Regatta-Class ships?
For ships of this size, they are unique in every sense: physical size, ambiance, intimacy, and wealth of amenities. With a crew of 400 for a maximum of 684-guests, the staff-to-guest ratio is extraordinary, allowing for uniquely personal service, a level of service that typically find only on ultra-luxury ships that charge double the price.
From a guest experience perspective, everyone loves how warm and “clubby” these ships feel. Guests and staff become family during the voyage. Our guests are intensely loyal; many have traveled 30, 40, or 50 times on these ships.
The Regatta-Class ships each have four restaurants, which is also rare for ships of this size or even larger, along with lavish spas and a multitude of lounges, bars, and public spaces.
In terms of itinerary, these ships traverse the globe, calling on all manner and sizes of ports from iconic cities—such as Rome, Barcelona, Venice, and New York—to off-the-beaten-path ports that larger ships cannot call upon—such as Amalfi, Positano, Sorrento, Capri, Seville, Ullapool, Archangel, Cienfuegos, and Santiago de Cuba.
But if I had to answer the question in just a few words, it’s their ambiance that is unlike that of any other ship.
You’ve stated that this revamp is better than a new build. Why?
It would be very tough to replicate these ships today given the very high standards to which they were built, the extent to which we are transforming them, and the very short period of time in which that is being accomplished.
And the public spaces are being completely transformed to be lighter, brighter, and more progressive. We’re retaining the sense of familiarity but putting a new polish and shine on them.
Since the ships are such fan-favorites, how changed will returning guests find these vessels?
Literally everything in staterooms and suites will be brand new. New bathrooms, furnishings, lighting, closets, desks and cabinetry, upholstery—even the veranda windows and doors. They are being stripped down to the steel and built out entirely new.
The public spaces will have new furnishings from Baker and Donghia, along with fabrics from Rubelli and Kravat. But we will be maintaining a sense of familiarity with iconic elements, such as the polished walnut and mahogany paneling, and the physical structure. But the look and feel will be new and refreshing.
Oceania Cruises
Gone are the bold colors, heavy patterns, and over-sized furnishings. In their place, will be a softer palette of colors and materials inspired by the legendary destinations we travel to.
How will these small ships compare to Marina and Riviera?
Marina and Riviera were the muses for this revamp; much of what is being done has drawn inspiration from them. The new lobby and grand staircase and the chandelier in the Grand Dining Room are perhaps the greatest nods to those two ships.
Oceania Cruises
Who has been helping Oceania with such a massive redesign?
Studio DADO, a renowned interior design firm based in Miami are overseeing the project and have worked hand-in-hand with our internal team to create these phenomenal suites, staterooms, and public spaces.
Why now? Where is such a substantial cash infusion coming from?
The ships were substantially upgraded back in 2013 and 2014 to infuse some of the elements from our then-new Marina and Riviera. As a brand, we are always looking forward and as we spoke to our guests and travel partners over the past few years, we began to outline the next chapter of the Oceania Cruises story.
When we scheduled itineraries for 2018 through 2020, we decided this was the time to transform the ships into something new, better-than-new. As we are a multi-billion dollar brand, the cost of the re-inspiration is coming from budgeted operating capital. This is just the first of many guest-experience enhancements that will be rolled out in 2018, 2019, and beyond.
Insignia will be the first ship to come out of dry dock later this year. Where will it be sailing in 2019?
Insignia will re-enter service in December 2018, sailing to Cuba and the Caribbean, and will kick off 2019 with a 180-day around the world voyage from New York to New York via Central America, Hawaii, the South Pacific, Australia, the Philippines, China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, India, Egypt, the Med, Ireland, the British Island and the Canadian Maritimes. She’ll spend the balance of the year cruising to Bermuda, Canada, New England and Cuba.
The entire Oceania fleet has earned a reputation as a favorite of food enthusiasts because of the excellence of its award-winning culinary programs. Will that be changing?
Each of the ships will retain its restaurant offerings but we are consistently raising the bar on our culinary offerings across the brand.
Oceania Cruises

Hong Kong activists have filed complaints over alleged police misconduct during the clashes with anti-extradition law protesters last Wednesday.
During the demonstration against the extradition bill, police deployed its Special Tactical Squad – nicknamed “raptors” – but many of them did not display any identification numbers or their ranks on their uniforms.
Explaining the issue to lawmakers at the Legislative Council on Wednesday, Secretary for Security John Lee said the uniforms had “no room” for identification numbers.
But Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said news reports relating to protests on June 9 and 10 showed that the team did have identification numbers on the uniforms. He said Lee’s claim was not therefore unconvincing.
Lam made a police report against Lee at the Wan Chai police headquarters.
“No numbers, no insignia on the shoulder, no warrant card – It is very difficult for residents and press to identify police officers who abused their power,” Lam said.
“If the police force allows many officers to hide their identification numbers, the objective effect is to encourage and to allow them to abuse their power, to act illegally.”
Hong Kong has seen the largest protests in its history amid government plans to update the city’s extradition laws to cover territories with which there are no prior agreements. Introduced in February in response to a Taiwan murder, the since-postponed bill would allow case-by-case fugitive transfers to other jurisdictions – such as China – without legislative oversight. The plan prompted a chorus of criticism from democrats, lawyers, journalists, foreign politicians and businesses, who say the mainland lacks human rights protections.
Rush to Citic Tower
During last Wednesday’s protests against the bill – which effectively forced the government suspension – 150 tear gas canisters, 20 bean bag rounds and several rounds of rubber bullets were deployed, according to Police Commissioner Stephen Lo. At least 76 were injured, and 32 were arrested.
The Civil Human Rights Front also filed a complaint against the police on Thursday.
As the unrest unfolded last week, the Front was holding a rally – approved by the police – outside Citic Tower next to the Legislative Council.
Jimmy Sham, convener of the Front, said the police used force to disperse participants of the rally without any warning. He said tear gas engulfed the crowd from both sides, forcing people to rush into nearby Citic Tower, where only one door was open.
“Thousands were at a peaceful rally. Many protesters were trying to find a space [to escape to] and they went on to our stage – and the police shot tear gas at the stage,” Sham said.
Sham said that the police action could have caused a stampede.

If Texas had an official vehicle, it would be a pickup truck. More of the mighty 4x4s are sold in the Lone Star state each year than any other.
Consequently, the annual State Fair of Texas offers more than just livestock exhibitions, leather goods, and smoked meats these days. Taking place in Dallas this weekend, fair organizers dedicate a sizeable chunk of their valuable fairground real estate to, you guessed it, pickups. Called the "truck zone," the area is devoted solely to these valued workhorses and all the accessories a weekend warrior or Texas rancher needs or could want.
Here are the highlights.
2020 Ford F-Series Ford
Ford's Power Play
Of all the truck manufacturers to make news at this year's fair, only Ford announced some headline-making numbers of the type the pickup segment typically trades in. In short, the 2020 version of the company’s 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V-8 has received a bump is power and torque to 1050 lb-ft of torque and 475 horsepower, respectively. That's enough grunt to knock the Cummins diesel-equipped RAM HD, which develops 1000 lb-ft and 400 horsepower, from its perch atop power mountain.
Ford also confirmed that its new 7.3-liter "Godzilla" V-8 gasoline engine, which will also be available in its Super Duty truck lineup, will be rated at 430 horsepower and 475 lb-ft of torque; that's an increase of 29 horsepower and 11 lb-ft of torque over GM's 6.6-liter V-8 and increase of 20 more horsepower and 46 lb-ft of torque over Ram's 6.4-liter gasoline Hemi V-8, respectively.
This being the extremely competitive truck world, expect a response from the competition—and probably soon.
Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Trail Boss Midnight Edition GM
Silverado 1500 Midnight Edition
New for the 2019 model year, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 makes the scene with the return of the popular Midnight and Rally Edition trim packages. The Midnight Edition brings blacked-out accents to the Silverado 1500 Trail Boss pickup while the Rally Edition Silverado 1500 is aimed at upping the visual appeal for the street set.
Available on the Trail Boss Custom and Trail Boss LT trims, the Midnight Edition is mostly a cosmetic option. Featuring a blacked-out grille, bumpers, and exhaust the dark treatment extends to the insignia, with black Silverado badging and Chevy bowtie emblems. Red tow hooks stand out against in the sea of black.
The Trail Boss off-road package is in full effect on Midnight Edition, including the factory Z72 off-road package with Rancho monotube shocks, a two-inch suspension lift, an automatic locking rear differential, skid plates, and 18-inch painted black wheels wrapped in Goodyear Duratrac rubber. The Custom trim Trail Boss Midnight Edition is available with either the 5.3-liter V-8 and six-speed automatic transmission or the 6.2-liter V-8 with a 10-speed automatic while the upmarket LT trim Trail Boss Midnight Edition gets the 6.2-liter and ten-speed as the sole powertrain option.
Neither of these vehicles indeed offers the same degree of open-desert running capability as the purpose-built Ford Raptor, but their well-curated hardware package offers enough off-road capability for the type of situations most owners will encounter.
Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Rally Edition GM
The street-focused Rally Edition Silverado 1500 is essentially the anti-trail boss. Available in Custom and RST trims, buyers can select from Black, Red Hot, Silver Ice Metallic, or Summit White exterior finishes, each one featuring a matching grille. Black striping compliments black tailgate lettering, badging, and exhaust tips.
Chevrolet's turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine and eight-speed automatic transmission is the only powertrain choice for the Custom trim Rally Edition, while the RST trim Rally Edition relies on either the 5.3-liter V-8 mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission or the 6.2-liter V-8 with a ten-speed automatic transmission for motivation.
2020 Ram 1500 Black Edition FCA
RAM 2020 1500 Black Edition and 2020 Ram HD Night Editions
RAM, formerly known as Dodge, has fielded Texas-only special editions like the Lone Star and Yellow Rose of Texas edition in past years, But the company took a less overt tact this year and ginned up the 2020 1500 Limited Black Edition and Heavy-Duty Big Horn and Laramie Night Editions to debut at the fair.
The 1500 Limited is already the top trim level for the half-ton model, and now it's available with more, uh, black. Included in the treatment are the grille and lettering, badging, tow hooks, exhaust, premium LED headlamps, grille surround, bumpers, door handles, and side-view mirrors. Available in both 4x2 and 4x4 configurations the 2020 Ram 1500 Limited Black is available with a variety of powertrains, including the 3.0-liter V-6 EcoDiesel, 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 and 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine with eTorque.
2020 Ram HD Night Edition FCA
The 2020 Ram Heavy Duty Night Editions feature black grille with body-colored surround, black badging and black 20-inch wheels, and 17-inch black wheels with machined pockets on the dual rear wheel models. Available on Ram 2500 and 3500 4x2 and 4x4 Crew Cabs, powertrains include a choice of 6.4-liter HEMI V-8 or the much-ballyhooed 6.7-liter Cummins I-6 with up to 1000-lb-ft of torque.
2020 Nissan TITAN SL-15 Nissan
New-ish 2020 Nissan Titan
Nissan sidestepped the popular blackout treatment, instead choosing to debut it's refreshed 2020 Titan. Comprised primarily of a new grille, bumper, headlamps, and foglamps it offers a fresh take on the polarizing upright Nissan fascia. Three new wheel designs are also on offer. A redesigned interior features an available new nine-inch infotainment screen and onboard Wi-Fi. The design work was carried out by a design team at Nissan Design America in La Jolla, California.

Garmin Marvel Legacy Hero Series Garmin
Garmin is getting into the superhero game.
Marvel Legacy Hero Series
Back when Garmin released the Marvel-themed vívofit jr., the company saw as much, if not more, excitement from parents buying the fitness trackers for their kids. Not ones to ignore untapped opportunity, Garmin got to work creating a brand new line of officially-licensed devices, the Marvel Legacy Hero Series.
The first two devices in the line (I say "first" because you can bet your cosmic cube there will be more) take their styling cues from the two biggest heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Captain Marvel and Captain America.
The Captain Marvel smartwatch is inspired by her costume with a blue leather band and light gold bezel. The Kree insignia is printed on the lens and the back of the case is engraved with "Higher, further, faster."
The Captain America watch has a 1940's vibe, with a nubuck leather band and stainless steel bezel. His infamous shield is printed on the lens and the boast "I can do this all day" is engraved on the case.
Garmin Marvel Legacy Hero Series with Connect app Garmin
Both devices take advantage of the virtual watchface, with several different themes and Garmin Connect avatars to choose from. Both also have similar functionality to Garmin's new vívoactive 4 (more on that in a second), with 24/7 health monitoring, sleep tracking, on-screen workouts, smart notifications, music downloads, Garmin Pay, and more.
Venu, vívoactive 4, vívomove Reveals
Garmin Venu Series Garmin
Additional devices unveiled today include Garmin's brand new Venu series (which, thankfully, is properly capitalized). It has an absolutely jaw-dropping AMOLED screen, which means that it may be the first Garmin device that looks as good in person as it does in its product shots (While I love Garmin, their transflective screens are built to be read in full sun and rarely look as crisp as their press shots). Taking advantage of this, Garmin is bringing new features to the Venu like animated workouts (a feature seen on some high end FitBit devices). There's also respiration tracking and sweat loss estimation - two more arrows in Garmins prodigious fitness tracking quiver. It, of course, has all the health monitoring and fitness tracking you'd expect from a Garmin device.
Garmin vivoactive 4 Series Garmin
The vívoactive 4 series is essentially the same as the Venu, but without the AMOLED screen. This does give it a battery life advantage, 8 days to the Venu's 5.
Garmin vivomove Series Garmin
The vívomove series is going to make you do a double take. It's a smartwatch that looks like, well, a watch. Hidden screens spring to life for all your health and fitness tracking needs. But when you don't need it? The vívomove looks just like any other (very snazzy) watch. The Luxe entries bring Italian leather and Milanese bands to the device, making them some of the most style-forward watches Garmin has ever produced.
I'll have hands-on impressions of Garmin's entire fall line in the next few months. If you'd like to learn more about the new devices (and maybe preorder a couple), head over to Garmin's site.

BRAZIL - 2019/09/11: In this photo illustration the Roku Streaming Player logo is seen displayed on ... [+] a smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) stock is up 4x this year, driven by the growth of its platform business, which sells ads and distributes streaming video content. While revenues of the platform business have grown at a CAGR of over 100% over the last 3 years, the media players business – which was once Roku’s bread and butter – has been growing at just ~6%. Separately, Roku has been increasingly licensing its operating system to TV manufacturers for their smart TVs, reducing its dependence on the players business for bringing new customers on to the Roku platform. In this analysis, we take a look at where Roku’s players business stands and what role it could play in Roku’s future.
View our interactive dashboard analysis Why Roku’s Low-Margin Players Business Remains Important To Its Growth
Low Revenue Growth For The Players Segment
Roku’s hardware revenues have been growing at a CAGR of 6% over the last 3 years, vs. a 100% CAGR for platform revenues.
We expect growth to slow further in the long-run, due to higher competition from rivals such as Amazon and Google.
Trefis
Roku Isn’t Making Money On Hardware
Players gross margins stood at ~11% in 2018, compared to over 70% for the platform division.
Accounting for other operating expenses, it’s unlikely for the company to be making any money on hardware.
This is likely because Roku is subsidizing its players to get more people on to its platform – from which it can generate recurring revenues.
Roku’s OS Licensing Business Is Growing Fast, Reducing Dependence On Standalone Player Sales For Adding New Platform Subscribers
Roku licenses its OS to smart TV manufacturers and this business is gaining traction, with over one-third of smart TVs sold in the U.S. over Q1 2019 being Roku powered.
The smart TV route might be a more efficient means of platform customer acquisition for Roku, as it only needs to license its OS to manufacturers.
Smart TV-based Roku platform users could also be more loyal, as TV sets cost several hundreds of dollars and have long replacement cycles (7 to 10 years per IHS Markit).
In comparison, switching costs for Roku’s streaming hardware is likely to be low, considering its low price points ($30 onward).


Roku Might Still Need To Bank On Its Players To Drive Platform User Growth
Although the hardware business is unlikely to be accretive to Roku’s earnings or valuation, we believe that it will remain important to the company for the foreseeable future.
We estimate that the company shipped about 6 million players in 2018. Considering that Roku’s platform user base grew by about 8 million users in 2018, it’s likely that a bulk of the expansion still comes from players.
Moreover, Roku’s OS licensing is limited to budget and mid-tier TV brands such as TCL, Insignia, and Sharp, meaning that average revenues from these users could be lower. With the Roku streaming hardware, the company could continue to address higher-value customers.

A 23-year-old man has this afternoon (Tues) pleaded guilty to causing the deaths of two friends from Dewsbury in an horrific crash on the M62.
Taryl Moxam, 23, from Barlborough in Derbyshire, was charged last month with causing the deaths of father-of-two Adam Afsar, 34, and 27-year-old Jason Wilby by dangerous driving over a collision on the exit slip road at junction 26 last April.
It was reported at the time of the fatal crash that the men had been in a Skoda Octavia which had been hit by an Vauxhall Insignia which was allegedly being driven the wrong way up the slip road.
Moxam, who arrived at Bradford Crown Court with two large holdalls, formally pleaded guilty to both of the causing death charges when he made his first appearance before Judge David Hatton QC shortly after 2pm.
The defendant was reported at the time to have suffered a broken wrist in the crash.
The judge, who is dealing with another unrelated trial, adjourned Moxam’s sentence hearing until Thursday afternoon saying it was in the interests of many people that the case was dealt with as soon as possible.
He estimated that the case could last at least an hour.
Barrister James Baird, for Moxam, said his client had come to court expecting to receive his sentence and he was making no application for his bail.
“Having regard to his pleas I think it appropriate he be remanded in custody,” said Judge Hatton.
The judge’s comment was met with a loud round of applause from the public gallery and he had to tell members of the public that he would not tolerate any interruptions in the proceedings.
Adam Afsar, 34, was a devoted father-of-two. He died alongside former security officer Jason Wilby, 27. Both were from Thornhill Lees, Dewsbury.
They were travelling in a white Skoda Octavia when it was hit by an oncoming black Vauxhall Insignia being driven the wrong way up the motorway slip road.
Mr Afsar was on his first shift for a delivery firm and Mr Wilby was accompanying him as it was late at night when the tragedy occurred.
Tish told the Examiner on the day of her eldest son’s death: “He is not dead, he has just closed his eyes until I can be with him.”

This is why Screaming Eagles wear cards on their helmets

A civilian oversight board for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department voted Tuesday to condemn a logo used by the agency's East L.A. station that a previous sheriff ordered removed in 2015.
The badge, displayed in several places across the station, features a helmet and boot surrounded by the words "Fort Apache" and "Low Profile." Below the image is a slogan, "siempre una patada en los pantalones," Spanish for "always a kick in the pants."
Some East L.A. residents, like Nicole Rojas, say it's a culturally insensitive reminder of a painful past.
“It’s representation of what has historically, traumatically invaded us as a people,” Rojas said at Tuesday's Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission meeting. “Its a very offense logo, and it needs to be removed.”
Three years ago, former Sheriff Jim McDonnell retired the insignia, along with other similar markings inside the station. But once he took office, Sheriff Alex Villanueva reinstated the logo at the East L.A. station he was formerly assigned to.
Neal Tyler, undersheriff under McDonnell, told the LAist the previous administration's concern was the connotation that deputies were in conflict with the community they policed — like the U.S. Army outpost depicted in the 1948 film "Fort Apache."
"Words have power. Symbols have power," Tyler told the website. "It does matter whether our symbols and our communications are civil and respectful."
But now, the department is adamant that the design has no negative undertones.
“I think they’re looking upon it as symbol of oppression, but it's far from that," current Undersheriff Tim Murakami told KTLA. "It came out of the East L.A. riots, when deputies were told to maintain a low profile. So it's kind of a mockery — that's why the helmet was on the boot... . There's lot of historical meaning behind it.”
But in an interview with the LAist, activist Carlos Montes said the ties to the 1970s Chicano protests is exactly where the problem lies.
"There was no question to us what 'Fort Apache' meant," he said. "They were in an outpost in the middle of the desert among the savages, the savage Mexicans, the savage Chicanos. So they had to have a fort to defend themselves."
Speaking on KTLA after Tuesday's vote, Sheriff Villanueva said the department would "remove the term Fort Apache from the logo in deference to the concerns from the Apache Nation."
"Every station has their own unit logo, and there’s 23 of these logos throughout the department," Villanueva said. "It’s just the same as the Army has Rangers, Green Berets. The Dodgers, they have minor league teams, every one has their own individual logo. So the logo itself, there’s nothing wrong with it."
It's unlikely that will satisfy residents who have deeper issues with the badge.
Brian Williams, executive director of the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission, said the fact that it offends people in the East L.A. community is cause enough for it to be stripped.
"We know there's some historical significance, there's some sheriff's deputies who believe this really is more about esprit de corps," Williams said. "But when we balance the equities between the sheriff's — who are public servants — and the message it sends to the community, we think it weighs in favor of the community and it should be removed."
After Tuesday's approval of a resolution calling for the controversial symbol's removal, the measure now heads to county Board of Supervisors for further action.

Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao Smart Logistics Network had reportedly delivered the first 100 million parcels from the Singles Day Global Shopping Festival in just 2.6 days, illustrating that the e-commerce giant is quite simply on a whole another level to the logistics companies in Southeast Asia which are beset by infrastructure challenges.
While Cainiao has been able to process 5 million parcels through customs clearance in less than 5 hours, and reached an all-time high of 416 million parcels handled domestically in a single day, Southeast Asia's logistics companies can't come anywhere close to matching the company and its partners in terms of scale, network and innovation. Not yet, at least.
Home to over 650 million people with diverse demographics, Southeast Asia's economies are on the rise. The region has been experiencing a robust expansion of its middle-class population, at it goes through a phase of rapid economic growth. Made up of 11 dynamic markets at different stages of development, it is quickly becoming an economic powerhouse.
Nielsen has predicted that the region's middle-class population will reach 400 million by 2020, over twice the size it was in 2012. According to data from the International Monetary Fund, the combined GDP of all ASEAN countries (10 member states) in 2017 amounted to around $2.8 trillion. By the end of 2018, that number is projected to rise to $2.97 trillion.
Southeast Asia's robust economic growth is supported by an increasing amount of consumers from across the region gaining access to the web. In 2018, the internet penetration in the region reached 58%. And with another 3.5 million users coming online each month, consumer behavior is rapidly shifting , which is fueling a boom in the e-commerce industry.
China's logistics market became the largest in the world back in 2012 after the country's retail sales posted an annual growth rate of more than 15% for several years. Southeast Asia is in the midst of a similar boom in consumer spending. According to a study by Google and Temasek, the region's retail sales are forecast to almost double to $1.38 trillion in 2025 from the $720 billion it recorded last year. Although the 11 countries of Southeast Asia share the mutual goals of development and expansion, they also share the similar logistical problems.
The region's logistics sector is still currently dominated by third-party logistics service providers, better known as 3PLs, which have traditionally been characterized as asset heavy and labor intensive. Seeing where the current trends are headed, 3PLs will need to further develop their digital capabilities in order to meet the needs of the region's rapidly growing retail sector, which presents an opportunity for tech-enabled startups to offer their expertise.
Millennials are the biggest adopters of e-commerce, and Accenture has projected that Asian millennials, in particular, have been projected to have an estimated spending power of $6 trillion by 2020. These young consumers are accustomed to receiving the instant gratification offered by today’s apps and services and have similar expectations with online retailers. Thus, e-commerce players in Southeast Asia are continuously focused on catering to this generation. They are racing to provide fast and engaging experiences to win over and retain customers, while capturing a higher average revenue per user (ARPU), and extending lifetime value (LTV).
Despite this, long tail merchants in Southeast Asia are still consolidating bulk orders before sending them to 3PL storefronts in order to save on delivery costs. This delays shipping and poses a major problem in maintaining customer satisfaction, let alone loyalty. Things get even trickier in countries with inadequate infrastructure and higher geographical barriers, like Indonesia.
Over the last three years, the Indonesian government has been spending a great deal of time and effort to accelerate the country’s infrastructure development and solve logistical problems. There have been significant improvements in the sector, as seen in the Logistics Performance Index, a biannual report published by the World Bank. Indonesia jumped 17 positions to 46th place out of 168 countries covered in the report.
Despite the remarkable achievement, Indonesia accounts for most of the region’s e-commerce market, but unfortunately still has some of the highest logistics costs across the region, accounting for 24% of the country’s GDP. While the ratio in neighboring countries, like Thailand and Malaysia reached 13.2% and 13%, respectively.
Quite a few industry players, including those from the digital sector, have tried to come forward and offer their solutions. While e-commerce giant Lazada has built up its own delivery operations in Indonesia to ensure timely delivery, tech startups like Shipper, intends to help cut the inefficiency in local logistics business by creating a first-mile logistics aggregator platform that offers pick-up and delivery services in the hopes of complementing its 3PLs services, while providing merchants the option to have their products delivered to customers on the next day - if not same day.
The age-old logistics industry is primed for technology disruption. Southeast Asian businesses are often run on relationships, with multiple agents facilitating each deal, eating away at the supplier’s profits and driving up prices for consumers as a result. Thus, some form of disintermediation has become essential to reinvent the current processes, especially now that the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies are enabling, while at the same time, demanding logistics providers to embrace tech and take their services to another level.
One of the proofs of this inefficiency can be seen in the trucking sector, which has been used by large FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) companies to carry inventory in bulk. This is a result of the lack of a single data point connecting all FMCG companies, trucking companies, and drivers together, resulting in several problems, such as under-utilized fleets, empty backhaul and insufficient drivers to arise in certain regions.
In Vietnam, another startup called Logivan has been exploring the possibility of utilizing data to better manage resources. By collecting data on truckers’ routes and company fulfillment needs, managers can function like control towers, directing demand to truckers to prevent empty backhauls. Adding to the potential benefits, pricing transparency may also be improved by utilizing a two-sided marketplace that can obtain the fairest price for both truckers and FMCG companies. Seeing the success of models like BlackBuck in India and ManBang in China serves to illustrate the untapped potential of these startups.
With advancements in technology, warehouses will no longer just be locations for storing a wide array of items, but instead can be transformed into fulfillment centers that are able to analyze consumer purchasing patterns and anticipate demand for certain products. By shipping and storing selected items in advance, 3PLs can respond to orders faster and utilize bulk shipments at a lower costs.
3PLs continue to seek ways to expand their service coverage. Aside from offering lower prices and faster delivery services, 3PLs compete with each other by working with agents to open storefronts nationwide that can better serve consumers. Although spreading physical collection points has been the go-to expansion model for ages, it is ultimately expensive to set up and maintain. Meanwhile, 3PLs have the opportunity to shorten the distance between the hubs and consumers by considering several options, such as utilizing spaces like mum-and-pop stores as sorting hubs. This way, it is easier for consumers to drop their packages at the hubs and more efficient for the 3PLs to distribute.

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — The leafy New Zealand city where a self-proclaimed racist fatally shot 50 people at mosques during Friday prayers is known for its picturesque meandering river and English heritage. For decades, Christchurch has also been the center of the country’s small but persistent white supremacist movement.
An expert on such fringe groups says it’s probably more than coincidence that the accused mosque shooter, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, settled in the region, known for a whiter demographic than the country’s north, after frequently traveling abroad in 2016-2018 in what appears to have been an extreme-right pilgrimage.
He went mostly to areas of Europe with a long history of sectarian dispute, including clashes between Renaissance Europe and the Ottoman Empire and the breakup of Yugoslavia following its ethnic and religious conflicts.
The attack has upended New Zealand’s image as one of the world’s safest and most tolerant countries. It also has highlighted apparent failings by security and intelligence services to view white supremacists as a real threat or to take seriously warnings from Muslim groups of a rise in Islamophobic and xenophobic incidents in recent years.
READ MORE: Donate, organize or show up: How to help after the New Zealand massacre
Tarrant planned his attack on two mosques meticulously and had resolved two years earlier to kill Muslims, according to a manifesto he published moments before the massacre. He actively planned the Christchurch shootings for the past three months, he said in the manifesto posted online and emailed to the office of New Zealand’s prime minister minutes before driving to his first target, the golden-domed Al Noor mosque.
Police say they are certain Tarrant was the only gunman but may have had support and are investigating that possibility. He had five guns, two of which were converted into semi-automatic weapons. It’s likely that at least some were legally purchased online from a Christchurch gun store.
Possible links between the shooter and white supremacists in New Zealand’s south have been alleged by recreational gun user and hunting guide Pete Breidahl.
In a video posted on Facebook on Saturday, he said he complained in late 2017 to an arms officer — a local police officer who monitors people’s gun licenses — about the disturbing behavior of members of a rifle club in the southern city of Dunedin that Tarrant reportedly joined.
In the video and comments posted online, Breidahl said the club members had Confederate flags, wore camouflage clothing with rank insignia, vilified Muslims and had homicidal fantasies. He claimed to have met Tarrant, calling him “not right.” Police said they have no record of a complaint but are looking into Breidahl’s claims further.
Academic Paul Spoonley, who has extensively researched white supremacist groups in New Zealand, said they have been relatively quiet in Christchurch since a 2011 earthquake that forced whole neighborhoods to move and altered the city’s demographics with an influx of migrant workers for reconstruction.
“They’ve been quieter recently but they haven’t gone away. They are still here,” he said, citing a 2016 incident in which pigs’ heads were left at the Al Noor mosque, where 42 people died in Friday’s massacre.
A business owner in Christchurch has also attracted media attention since the massacre because his company’s vans were emblazoned with neo-Nazi references including the “black sun” symbol that Tarrant’s guns were covered with. The same images, which are used as the company’s branding, appear on its website.
When AP visited the registered business address, located in one of Christchurch’s poorer neighborhoods, three of its vans were parked opposite, their “black sun” imagery removed but still identifiable by a company website address on them. A visibly hostile man standing beside the vans, who did not appear to be the business owner, did not want to answer questions.
Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a 44-year-old man in Christchurch for distributing objectionable material and he would appear in court the next day.
According to Spoonley, the level of hate crimes in New Zealand is low compared with other countries as is the number of white supremacists, but it’s “always a challenge to get people to accept that they exist.”
“There’s a reluctance to see equivalence between the risks presented by right-wing extremist groups and radical Islamic and leftist groups,” he said.
Neighboring Australia’s white supremacist scene is more virulent, in part reflecting the history of its “White Australia” immigration policy which existed in various forms from soon after Federation in 1901 to as late as 1973. In modern times, the rise of a succession of prominent right-wing politicians — starting with Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party in the mid-1990s — also legitimized such views.
Spoonley estimates there are 200-250 hardcore white supremacists in New Zealand and about 300-400 people on the edges.
“I would be very surprised if Tarrant didn’t make some sort of contact,” he said.
The groups, which emerged in the late 1960s, have evolved over time, coalescing for years around fear of New Zealand moving too far from its British roots, anti-Semitism and opposition to Maori sovereignty and Asian immigrants, and then shifting to Islamophobia following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S.
Spoonley, who researched extreme-right groups in the U.K. in the 1970s, said when he returned to New Zealand in the 1980s he was told by authorities there were no similar organizations.
But he quickly found more than 70 extreme-right groups, many of them in Christchurch. He attributes three murders in New Zealand since 1989 to white supremacists, including two that were ideologically motivated — a South Korean tourist in 2003 and a homeless gay man in 1999.
As Tarrant plotted more recently, Muslim groups in New Zealand were growing increasingly concerned by a rise in abuse against the community but say they were ignored.
“There has been an increasing trend which has been brought to the attention of the authorities several times in the last three to four years, including police,” said Anwar Ghani, a spokesman for a federation of Islamic organizations. “It was treated not so seriously.”
Verbal abuse, hate emails, hate phone calls and assaults that seem to have an Islamophobic and racist motivation, or a combination of the two, are among the hate crimes experienced by Muslims in New Zealand, he said.
The country does not have an official hate crimes database, making it difficult to measure the trend, but some incidents have been widely reported, causing outrage but sparking no real official measures.
Ghani said there are dotted lines between Friday’s massacre, hostility to Muslims among a segment of the New Zealand population and the global rise of extreme right-wing movements.
“If the issue is not addressed in a proper manner then the problem will continue to increase,” he said. “They are getting bolder and bolder.”
Paul Buchanan, a former policy analyst and intelligence consultant for U.S. government security agencies, said the failure of intelligence agencies to detect Tarrant reflects politically based decisions to concentrate resources on monitoring the small number of Islamic extremists in New Zealand.
“My interpretation is that in the past 20 years and since 9/11 a political decision was made to prioritize detection and prevention of homegrown jihadists,” he said.
“They decided to go whole hog, 80-85 percent of resources into detecting jihadists,” he said. “The rest was devoted to Marxists, environmentalists, animal rights activists. They went for the left.”
One such jihadi from New Zealand, along with an Australian, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in November 2013 while fighting for al-Qaida.
There was no political advantage in targeting alienated young white men seen by the wider population as mostly harmless “Pakeha losers,” a Maori word for white New Zealanders, Buchanan said.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said the government will convene an inquiry into the intelligence and security services, seeking to understand why Tarrant was able to escape detection.
Tarrant, according to Buchanan, may have been part of a small cell.
“There could be tacit enablers,” he said.
“He was planning for two years,” Buchanan said. “To be able to do that in utter secrecy suggests someone had to have an inkling that the guy was going to do something and said nothing about it.”

Banca Transilvania announced in October 2018 that it updated its general business conditions, and with this step, it has defined a new type of card transaction – the money transfer. The bank’s aim was to charge top-up fees, that is, transferring money from the bank account to the Revolut or Orange Money accounts.
Banca Transilvania’s customers have been informed that when they use their credit cards to transfer money to applications like Revolut or Orange Money, the transactions will incur fees like a cashback, because Banca Transilvania defines a transaction with a payment card for goods or services only as an operation performed at POS terminals from merchants who have displayed the insignia of the international organization under whose emblem the card was issued (VISA or Mastercard).
With this step, the bank removes from the purchases of goods or services card transactions for other financial services. In this way, cashing an account or card, an application, or simply transferring money through and from an application, as well as internet transactions for money transfer, will be charged.
In the case of credit cards used for such transfers, Banca Transilvania has decided to apply a fee equal to the cash withdrawal from its ATMs or POSs, of 1 percent of the transaction value (but no less than RON 2.5).
Thus, BT is joining CEC Bank and OTP Bank, as well as other European banks who have treated fintech Revolut service the same way.
Finally, BT also decided to stop giving traveling miles for BT Flying Blue card transactions that customers made to money transfer applications and services such as Revolut, BRD Finance IFN, TSI-Paymentwall , IFN Telecredit, Libra Pay, Mobilo Finance, VivaCredit, Volt, M-pesa, or Orange Money.

Armed Men Pose as DEA Agents to Try Get Inside Texas Home, Suspects Still at Large
Pearland police are searching for two men who allegedly dressed up as Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents to try to enter a home in the area on Tuesday.
The pair, who are believed to have been armed with handguns, approached the Texas home at around 7:14 p.m. local time on May 28 dressed in blue jeans and black t-shirts with “D.E.A” written on the front and “police lettering” on the back.
The Pearland Police Department also said the suspects’ faces were concealed with face masks.
“Both men appeared to be armed with handguns, and were wearing balaclavas to hide their faces,” the Pearland Police Department shared in a Facebook post.
“One suspect appeared to be a black male, and the second appeared to be white or Hispanic male.”
They allegedly announced “DEA” as they tried to get into the residence in the 11500 block of Ivory Creek Drive, and claimed to have a search warrant for the home.
Footage of the incident shows one of the men pounding on the homeowner’s door before briefly stepping back to flip through what appears to be a white paper folder.

The second individual remains motionless and stands slightly behind the other.
However, when the homeowner said she was calling the police, the armed men fled the scene, possibly in a Chevrolet SUV, a Suburban, or Tahoe with paper plates, police said.
Footage of the incident was captured by the homeowner’s home surveillance system.
The department added that police searched the area, but could not locate the suspects or their vehicle.
Authorities have warned residents to keep on the lookout for the men, and urged anyone with knowledge of the suspects to get in touch with the Pearland Police Department.
DEA Impersonation
The incident is not the first time individuals have posed as a federal agents, which is violation of federal law, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, Diversion Control Division (USDOJ).
In March, a man from San Jose, California, was charged with impersonating a DEA agent after he allegedly pulled over drivers, including a federal agent who was off-duty at the time, reported the Washington Times.

The 49-year-old named Alex Taylor was arrested after making unauthorized traffic stops in a vehicle with police lights, posing as a DEA agent.
Taylor was arrested on suspicion of impersonating a federal officer, unlawful possession of official badges, identification cards “or other insignia,” and the use and possession of a counterfeit seal of a United States federal agency, the DEA said, the Times reported.
The USDOJ also warned the public in a press release that individuals had been posing as DEA Special Agents, DEA Investigators, or other law enforcement personnel as part of an international extortion scheme.
WARNING: @DEAHQ is warning the public about criminals posing as Special Agents/other law enf. as part of an intn’l extortion scheme.

Posing as DEA agents or law enforcement officials from other agencies, the individuals phone victims—who in the majority of cases purchased drugs online or by telephone in the past—and tell them doing so is illegal.
They then tell the victims to pay a “fine” to prevent enforcement action from being taken against them.
These types of scam calls have gone back as far as 2008, and often target the elderly, officials said, according to Dallas News.
The USDOJ warned that DEA agents never demands payment from the public over the phone.
Terri Wyatt, a spokeswoman for the Dallas division of the DEA, told Dallas News in 2012, “No legitimate DEA agent is going to make a call and threaten anyone like that.”

MISSOULA — To better fit its geographical reach and embrace a more inclusive approach, Missoula Federal Credit Union is now known as Clearwater Credit Union.
Alert your member neighbors and friends – and don’t forget those in outlying areas, where the former Missoula FCU now serves seven contiguous counties in western Montana.
Ahead of the name change, the credit union board and administration garnered feedback from members via surveys and focus groups. Catching members off-guard with the name change is the last thing they wanted.
“Having the opportunity to hear directly from our members has really helped us set priorities to ensure we make this name change as hassle-free as possible,” said spokeswoman Gwen Landquist, the credit union’s brand and communications director.
Some longtime members reportedly love the new moniker; others said they were sad to see MFCU go. Some openly shared their unhappiness with the change.
“That is completely understandable, considering we were founded in 1956,” said Landquist. “Everyone who has reached out with feedback (positive or negative), we have reached back and talked to them about it. In most cases, even those who had an initial negative reaction ended up feeling positive by the end of the conversation. We’ve made a point to listen to all feedback with an open mind and a positive attitude. I think that has made a big difference.”
So why “Clearwater?”
“The name celebrates our roots in Missoula County, which is home to both Clearwater River and Clearwater Lake,” the credit union said in its June 18 announcement to members. “Water sustains us all, no matter where we’re from. The new name is universally appealing and a celebration of Montana’s lakes, rivers, and streams. The name gives us the opportunity to speak to a key element of our core values: transparency.”
Landquist and staff scurried mightily up until Labor Day weekend to complete the changeover, which officially occurs on Tuesday.
“Behind the scenes, we have been busy prepping everything for launch day,” she said. “This part of the brand transition is going to be much more of an instant change. Everything from exterior signage, the website, all the way down to our pens change to Clearwater. Some items will continue to be done in phases (new cards, checks, etc.), but we anticipate being pretty well transitioned before we close out the year.
“We have used these opportunities to design ads that also let people know what is coming,” said Landquist.
The credit union sponsors several events and nonprofits that require updated ads.
In other logistics, the credit union unveiled a new logo that more widely symbolizes Montana and uses state flag colors.
Reads the new Clearwater Credit Union website:
“Our new logo conveys transparency with the ability to see the mountains through the water drop. The mountains themselves reflect the beauty of our state, and even form an ‘M’ in honor of our roots here in Missoula.”
The blues, brown, green and yellow reflect state resources portrayed on the “Oro y Plata” flag depiction.
“Our new colors are inspired by the Montana state flag, reminding us of both the incredible natural environment that surrounds us as well as the people and industry that have shaped this amazing place we call home,” reads the company website.
But will the credit union’s current debit cards still work?
According to the new Clearwater website, the old debit and credit cards will continue to work until members activate the new cards the credit union mails in the weeks to come. The new cards will have a new expiration date.
As for leftover checks bearing the MFCU insignia and logo, members can continue to use them because their routing number and account numbers remain the same.
The next time you need to order new checks, Clearwater will provide those with the new name and logo. As of Sept. 3, members can turn in old checks at any branch, then staff will replace them with a box of new ones for free.
It’s the only name change in the 63-year history of the credit union, which now tallies over 50,000 members and manages over $500 million in assets.
After opening its first branch in Stevensville in 2006, the credit union opened branches in four more counties in 2018: Beaverhead, Deer Lodge, Granite and Silver Bow.
“We’ve been serving three counties for years now – Missoula, Lake and Ravalli,” said Landquist. “When our field of membership expanded to include seven counties, the question was raised of whether or not we should change our name to be more inclusive to all of the communities we serve.”
Eventually, the board decided a name change was in the best interest of the credit union’s long-term success.
“With that, a name that celebrated place and also spoke to our values, felt like the right direction,” she added.
Landquist said the credit union distributed emails to members, sent out press releases, launched an online microsite, and posted on social media to spread the word.
Specifically, staff let members know the word “federal” will no longer be included in the logo.
However, the credit union remains federally chartered.
“Regulations no longer require the inclusion of it (“federal”) for marketing purposes, and it makes it shorter and easier to say,” she added.
“We hope to be known as Clearwater, not CCU,” reads the new website in a user-friendly list of questions and answers. “It also gives us the flexibility to become a state-chartered credit union in the future, were we to agree together to make that shift.”
The credit union board said the survey process “revealed that while we will always love the name Missoula Federal Credit Union, it hinders a sense of belonging for non-Missoulians and limits our ability to demonstrate our values in new communities.”
Involving members in all outlying areas was key, said Landquist.
“And honestly, I think this is the best thing we could have done,” she said. “We are incredibly fortunate to have engaged members. They ask great questions and often have even better ideas. Having the opportunity to hear directly from our members has really helped us set priorities to ensure we make this name change as hassle free as possible.”

Notts County supporters can protect themselves from losing money on season ticket purchases by paying with credit cards.
With the new season just eight weeks away, the Magpies are still threatened by the possibility of administration or liquidation.
On Monday, the Post reported that the National League were understood to be concerned about the lack of progress with Notts' takeover and with the identities of those looking to buy the club.
An upcoming High court hearing on July 10 could see the club fall into administration or be liquidated over a £250,000 unpaid tax bill.
If the worst case scenario of liquidation happens, legal protection is available to supporters should they make season ticket purchases with credit cards, and card companies have no choice about it.
With purchases costing over £100, credit card companies are "equally liable as the retailer" under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.
Whatever rights fans would have held with purchases from the football club, the buyers also hold with their credit card company.
Once a payment is made, the buyer enters into an arrangement to borrow, allowing them these rights.
At last count the Magpies has already sold more than 1,500 season tickets for their debut season in non-league with fans quick to show their support, despite off-field issues. Adult season tickets range from £276 to £345, with the lowest price coming in at £25 for under-12s.

British billionaire Sir James Dyson has donated nearly $24 million (£18.75 million) to his former school to develop a new center teaching robotics, programming, artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Gresham’s School in Norfolk, which Sir James attended from 1956 to 1965 and where both of his parents taught, will open a new center for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education.
The new “Dyson Building” will be designed by architects Wilkinson Eyre and will be completed by September 2021.
Gresham's School @Gresham's
Dyson is famous for attending art school in London yet making his fortune with high-tech reinventions of gadgets like vacuum cleaners, hand dryers and fans. In a statement about the gift, Dyson say that while “engineering and science are the most fulfilling of careers, they are also vitally important to our society and economy.
“To prime a pipeline of young people who want to study engineering, we must inspire them at the earliest possible stage—I hope this building will do just that.”
Addressing the need to catch the next generation of Britain’s “brilliant young minds” as early as possible, the entrepreneur adds that children from around age 6 are “very engaged ... inventive, dreaming up ideas, and curious, wanting to know how they can be made.” He adds, “But these traits get stamped out of them, partly by the system and partly because the teaching of these subjects in schools has not kept up with the pace of technological change. By creating state-of-the-art spaces I hope that we can foster, inspire and educate more brilliant young minds.”

Douglas Robb, Gresham’s headmaster, says: “This is by far the largest donation the school has ever received and the new spaces will have an immense impact. The building will enable new approaches to teaching, encouraging project work and collaboration. Spaces will be equipped with the latest technology to ensure the highest levels of teaching; from robotics and programming, to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning.”
Gresham’s is an exclusive, independent, coeducational day and boarding school for pupils aged 2 to 18, located on the north Norfolk coast.
The fees are £11,660 (US$14,600) per term for senior students, and £8,450 (US$10,700) per term for the preparatory school. The school was founded in 1555 by Sir John Gresham, who went on to become Lord Mayor of London.

“Old Greshamians” (former pupils) include the composer Benjamin Britten, the poet W.H. Auden and hovercraft inventor Sir Christopher Cockerell. More recent alumni include BAFTA- and Oscar-winning actress Olivia Colman and film director Stephen Frears.
Dyson adds, “Both my parents taught at Gresham’s, and my father was head of the classics department. When he returned from fighting with the 14th Army in Burma during the war, he threw himself into the life of the school, producing plays, taking games, the CCF and the sailing club. When he was ill, he carried on teaching but died when I was 9. The generosity of the school meant I could continue there after his death.”
Who Is Sir James Dyson?
James Dyson is chairman of Dyson Inc., which generated $5.8 billion in sales in 2018 from a range of luxury consumer gadgets. Dyson’s entrepreneurial story started with his frustration with his family’s vacuum, leading him to invent a new cyclone-power version in 1978.
Today, Dyson Inc. employs more than 5,800 engineers around the world and says it invests about $10 million a week in product development. Dyson plans to challenge Tesla and other car manufacturers with the launch of an electric car in 2021.

When it comes to uniform unveilings for the annual Army-Navy game, we normally see both teams wait until the week of the game before officially revealing their look for the annual curtain closer for regular season college football. Navy and Under Armour broke that trend when they decided to unveil their uniform design in mid-October. However, Army and Nike decided to wait until the usual time to unveil their look for the big game. The result is yet another creative design for Army at a point when the eyes of the college football world will be upon them.
This year, Army's uniforms for the Army-Navy game are a tribute to the over 28,000 troops who formed the First Expeditionary Division that was sent overseas to fight in World War I. The division wore a shoulder insignia that displayed the number one in red, which explains the nickname of the "Big Red One" and is also the main inspiration behind these uniforms.

The traditional trim color of gold is still present on the collar logos and the name and numbers. Other than that, the presence of red serves as a striking contrast and is the first thing that draws your attention. The Nike logos on the helmet and uniform are all in red, the phrase "Big Red One" is placed on the opposite side of the red Swoosh logo. The Big Red One also plays a prominent role on the helmet, as it serves as the helmet logo in similar fashion to how the Infantry Division's helmets had the same insignia on their helmets.
One of the more interesting design elements is the sublimated black lion design on the sleeves of the jerseys. Once again, this is another tribute to the infantry who fought in World War I, specifically the 28th Infantry that helped win the Battle of Cantigny and became known as the Black Lions of Cantigny.

There are no outlandish striping patterns or anything else that could be considered out of the ordinary on this uniform. Instead, it's one of those uniforms where you have to pay attention to the details and the details are indeed striking. From the bold elements of red to the sublimated black lion, it's a tribute that manages to fit in with the tradition of cutting-edge designs that Nike and Army have put on display in recent years for their biggest rivalry game of the season.
The 2018 Army-Navy Game should be one of the more interesting uniform matchups in the illustrious history of the rivalry. From an aesthetic standpoint, these two academies have come a long way from even the mid-2000s which is when the two teams basically stuck to what they wore during the regular season. That meant that the game was basically a battle between a black-and-gold team and a navy blue-and-gold team.

While Navy is sticking to their colors for the most part, Army will be going with a distinctly new look and from an aesthetic standpoint, that makes this game a very intriguing one to keep an eye on as the college football regular season comes to its conclusion.

Amazon is reportedly looking to expand its own-branded devices to include an Amazon 4K Smart TV.
The Telegraph claims that the online retailer, which is currently hosting its Prime Day sales on thousands of products, is working with a "group of Chinese manufacturers", including Huawei, to make its own television set.
This set will have a 4K Ultra HD resolution, Freeview HD tuner and the ability to watch Prime Video content without the need for a separate set-top-box. Alexa-support will also be built in.
It is in testing by the DTG, it is said, which is the UK's industry body that maintains the country's digital terrestrial broadcast standards.
Amazon is no stranger to working with TV manufacturers for televisions that carry Amazon services. There are several models in the US that are classified as "Fire TV Edition", with Amazon's own Fire TV platform working as those sets' Smart TV systems.
Toshiba and Insignia (Best Buy's own label) are the manufacturers making Fire TV-enabled TVs in the States. However, they are branded Toshiba and Insignia respectively.
The Telegraph report suggests something quite different; the Amazon TV would be branded just that, much like Echo, Kindle and Fire TV devices.
There's no word yet on when the TV might become available - or even if - and Amazon declined to comment to the Telegraph. We'll keep you posted though.
And, in the meantime, you can turn your existing TV into an Amazon Smart one through a 4K Fire TV or Fire TV Stick. They are both on offer now and you can find out more here.

Changes designed to make Robin Hood travel cards in Nottingham safer from fraudsters may mean that some aren't working.
The cards can be used on buses and trams to pay for transport instead of using standard tickets.
Passengers can top up pay-as-you go cards at ticket machines across the city or use pre-paid season cards instead.
When cards are reported as stolen or lost, the cards are blocked.
However, city council officials said there were issues with the previous security system, and some blocked cards were still working.
The council has since been working to upgrade the system, which now means that only cards which have been recently active will work.
Councillor Dave Liversidge, Nottingham City Council’s portfolio holder for transport, said: “When people report a Robin Hood card lost or stolen we block the card to stop it being used fraudulently.
"There were issues with our old system where some blocked cards were still working – which has led to some abuse of expired cards.
"We have now upgraded our system to ensure that only the most recent active cards will work.
“If a card is showing as blocked then either you are using an old card - not the new replacement - or the direct debit has been cancelled in which case it is no longer active.
"If you are having issues, go to the travel centre in the Victoria Bus Station and they can confirm which is the active card, or advise on reactivating a direct debit if this has expired."
Liam Conway, of a group called the Disabled Persons Mobility Pass Campaign, said he recognised the reasons behind the move "in dealing with fraud".
He added: "They should be giving some thought to how they are going to contact people who might be entitled to a card but might still only have the old card."

A late night burglar was locked up for raiding two homes and leaving sleeping families in shock.
After the offences, 19-year-old Jake Shaw went to McDonald's cafés with friends and bought food with stolen bank cards, a court heard.
He already had 22 offences on his criminal record as Recorder Simon King sent him into a young offenders' institution for three years and six months.
And he warned Shaw: "Unless you take steps to turn your life around, things are going to get worse and worse.
"We see in the courts people getting into trouble time and time again. They find it very difficult to get out of that cycle. You will have to wait a while before you have your liberty to start that change.
"You have got to take responsibility," he told Shaw, of Lotus Close, St Ann's.
Eunice Opare-Addo, prosecuting, said the first burglary took place at a house on Third Avenue, Gedling, after 2.47am on November 25. A couple slept through the raid which involved Shaw and three others.
At around 9am, Shaw used a bank card to pay a £21 bill at McDonald's.
Items stolen included computer equipment holding photographs and music collected over 20 years as well as a book which the resident was writing and illustrating.

"Every time she walks through the village she looks down alleyways and in bushes hoping to find the hard drive but it has still not been recovered," said Miss Opare-Addo.
She said the second burglary took place at around 12.40am on February 5. This time the home was on Marshall Road, Mapperley.
On this occasion, two cars were taken and were later seen at a retail park in Mansfield. Four men spent £91 at McDonald's with a stolen card.
Miss Opare-Addo said: "Since the incident, one occupant had sleepless nights and no longer feels safe in her home. It caused significant distress."
Richard Posner, mitigating, said Shaw was with others and told the court: "This is four lads behaving very badly.
"In terms of groups or a gang, and the definition of a group or gang, this is not in the area of gangland offending."
He had a warehouse job lined up at the time. Mr Posner added: "He does want to put things right in his life and stop offending in this way."
Shaw admitted two counts of burglary, handling stolen goods and fraud.

This has probably happened to you: You sit down in front of your TV to watch your favorite movie or show, the credits roll, and everything looks strange. People move around unnaturally, and every shift of the camera is slightly disorienting. You can't shake the feeling that whatever you're watching is somehow too smooth.
That's probably because it is. It's called motion interpolation, a special smoothing effect many TVs can use to push the frame rate past the native rate of the show or movie you're watching (usually 24 or 30 frames per second, nudged up to 60, 120, or even higher). Colloquially it's known as the "soap opera effect," because it makes whatever you're watching look like a daytime soap opera. The TV is adding additional frames, digitally combining and interpolating the images in the video signal to simulate more than are actually there. It can be useful for watching sports and video games, but for most content it's jarring and unnatural.
You don't need to live with it, though. If your TV has motion smoothing features, it probably has some way to turn them off. You just need to dive into your TV's picture settings and flip the switch to make film look like film and primetime TV look like primetime TV again.
For some TVs, the Cinema or Movie mode automatically disables motion smoothing, because it's understood that you want to watch film content (again, 24 or 30fps video) as it's presented. Put your TV in Cinema or Movie mode, whichever is present, and see if it turns off the soap opera effect. If it doesn't, you'll have to manually disable the motion smoothing.
Different brands have different names for motion smoothing features, and you need to be able to identify the right one for your TV. Look for any setting with "Motion" in the name under the Picture or General settings of your TV and see if it's enabled, then disable it. If you aren't sure, here are some of the most common settings for different TV brands.
LG
LG calls its motion smoothing feature TruMotion, and it can be found on most of its TVs. In the Picture menu, select Picture Mode Settings, then Picture Options, then TruMotion. Here you can disable TruMotion.
Samsung
Samsung's feature is called Auto Motion Plus. In the Settings menu, go to Picture, then Expert Settings. Select Auto Motion Plus and set it to Off.
Android TV (Hisense, Sony)
Hisense simply calls its motion smoothing feature Motion Smoothing. For Sony, the motion smoothing feature is called Motionflow. In both Hisense and Sony Android TVs, the features can be found in the same menu. Press the Home button to go to the Android TV home screen, then scroll down to Settings. Select System Settings, then Picture. Scroll down to Motionflow or Motion Smoothing and turn it off.
Roku TV (Element, Hisense, Insignia, RCA, Sharp, TCL, and More)
Roku TVs made by Element, Hisense, RCA, TCL, and other companies all have very similar menu systems because they use the same Roku interface. Not every Roku TV has a motion smoothing feature, but those that do call it Action Smoothing. While on your desired input or playing video from an app, press the Option button to bring up the menu screen. Select Advanced Picture Settings. Scroll down to Action Smoothing and disable it.
Amazon Fire TV (Element, Insignia, Toshiba, Westinghouse, and More)
Several manufacturers use Amazon's Fire TV platform. They include Element, Insignia (both companies makes both Fire TV and Roku TV televisions), Toshiba, and Westinghouse. If any of these TVs have motion smoothing features, they're simply called Motion Processing. Bring up the Settings menu, select Picture, then choose Advanced Options. If Motion Processing is on the list, turn it off.

Capturing the charms of a locale – particularly when it is an interesting one – is not a new concept for hotel designers. But Vintry & Mercer, a new boutique hotel in the heart of the City of London, and sister to the Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington, has gone the extra mile in reflecting the destination’s age-old charms.
(Credit: Amy Murrell)
Found on the narrow, alley-way-like lane that is Garlick Hill, in between Mansion House and Cannon Street, you immediately feel like you’ve stepped away from the hustle and bustle of the city’s wheeling and dealing and transported instead back to a Dickensian time. From the plant-filled lobby to the old trading maps turned into wallpaper in the bedrooms, it’s imbued with quirky references to the area’s heritage.
(Credit: Amy Murrell)
Found in London’s historic Vintry Ward, the hotel uses this location as its starting point. The warren of lanes is where many of the City’s Guilds were founded, such as the Vintry Guild, established in 1363, which traded wines, and the Mercer Guild, in 1304, which traded in fine fabrics – hence the hotel’s name. Bedrooms are artfully curated to reflect the old-meets-new worlds – with lavish claret velvet drapes, oversized velvet button headboards and insignia embroidered cushions to give almost a medieval take on luxury (an oxymoron perhaps, but it works). Retro dial phones, Marshall radios and fitting C.E. Bigelow bath products give a hip touch, perfect for Millennials. Meanwhile, large-format teal metro tiles and power showers in the bathrooms and design-led lighting throughout give a top-end-feel that any city slicker would be satisfied with.

Public areas fuse modern-metropolitan style with a faint hint of Victoriana steam-punk confidence. Forest-green leather chesterfield sofas sit next to marble occasional tables, there’s a wall of vintage suitcases in the basement fashioned to be an art installation, and the library-come-meeting room has bright turquoise cabinetry and a collection of vintage books (inexplicably placed near the ceiling so you'll need to find a ladder to read one).

Off the lobby, a delicate floral chandelier cascades down a circular staircase which leads to the basement rooms. Here you’ll find the subterranean speakeasy bar, Do Not Disturb. Bar staff serve you in butcher-style leather aprons (the men with obligatory whiskery moustaches) and you sit in rose-lit booths reminiscent of a 1920s' New York. There are pictures of Ziegfeld Follies girls on the wall, and burgundy leather banquettes and mustard velvet chairs give an opulent feel. The cocktail list is extensive – from a classic Manhattan to a Hanky Panky – and all have a backstory to make them more enticing. Nibbles and small plates include on-trend polenta fries, tacos and sliders.
(Credit: Amy Murrell)
After drinks in the darkened bar, head upstairs to the star of the show which is decidedly the light-drenched Mercer Roof Terrace. Headed up by head chef Chris Golding, the glass-fronted restaurant looks out on to a characterful terrace, with huge potted plants and strung-up fairy lights – sure to be a hit in the summer months. The space immerses you among the rooftops of London’s buildings – with the dome of St Paul’s feeling like it is gloriously within touching distance – and making you feel like you are in the chimney-sweep scene of Mary Poppins. Inside, in the airy dining room, a Josper Grill serves up tomahawk steaks and racks of lamb – ideal for power meetings. But the highlights of the menu are Golding’s lighter, seasonal touches – a starter of Cornish Crab, Avocado, Cucumber and Watercress Mayonnaise is a pretty picture. While, from the ‘Sea’ section of the menu, the Halibut with Anchovy Butter and Broccoli is a subtle, flavoursome choice. Desserts are twists on classic British puddings – Apple Crumble with Malted Milk Ice Cream or Doughnut Rhubarb & Custard. Deliciously old-school.
(Credit: Amy Murrell)
Golding also oversees the ground-floor bistro, the Vintry Kitchen, which has an industrial aesthetic, and an Asian tapas-style menu. It also has a focus on wine, which is tapped straight from barrels and inspired by the area’s connection to merchant sailors landing from Bordeaux, who used to store their wines nearby. From Steamed Buns to Tempura Shrimp or the genius Beef Rib Teriyaki Arancini – the menu is full of small plates and tasty delights. It’s also the place to start your day with a wide breakfast and brunch menu – the Brioche French Toast, Grilled Banana & Honey is a full-on sugar kick, and, giving a nod to the vegan-trend, it also serves a decent Vegan Full-English.

The hotel also has enough eco-friendly touches to keep abreast of ‘green’ expectations among modern-day travellers – with 100 per cent renewable electricity, sourced from wind, solar and biomass generators, solar panelling, heat pump technology in the air-conditioning system, and a ‘Combined Heating and Power’ system to minimize environmental output. It may be named after an ancient world, but Vintry & Mercer has one foot in the future.
The mid-week rate for a standard room is from £285 per night, vintryandmercer.com

CTV is the portion of OTT that’s watched on an actual TV set. These days, that’s usually between 80% and 90% of all viewing, depending on the platform.
Which is why the TV industry was quite happy this week to see that CTV advertising is booming, growing at nearly unheard of rates.
According to a the latest research from Beachfront, an independent video supply-side platform (e.g., publisher-side platform), ad requests on CTV are up an astounding 1,640% year-over-year.
That’s not a typo, that’s the actual percentage: we went from 1.7 billion CTV ad requests in November 2017 to 29.9 billion in November 2018.
It’s a significant number, says Beachfront CEO Frank Sinton, because the level of spending proves that “connected TV can’t be viewed as an extension of digital spend, or reused linear TV advertising anymore. It is its own unique source for monetization.”
It’s A Roku World
One other interesting fact uncovered by Beachfront’s research is that 87% of all CTV ad requests are made from Roku devices. That’s partly because Roku has a thriving ad business and partly because Roku continues to be consumers’ connected device of choice.
As the “Switzerland of connected devices” Roku has managed to steer clear of the turf wars that have beset its competitors: no Amazon Prime on Apple TV until earlier this year, no official YouTube app on Amazon Fire TV. Roku takes all comers and carries everything from Netflix, Amazon and Hulu to channels from small yoga studios and churches.
The other big news on the device front was the ascendency of Amazon Fire TV, which climbed from fourth place in 2017 to second place in 2018 in terms of ad requests.
The devices matter because they're an indication of where people are watching: while Roku does maintain its own thriving ad business (a business that now accounts for more than 50% of its revenue) it doesn’t sell all of the inventory that runs on Roku devices. (Though it does take a 30% cut of it.)
Many of the larger networks—Hulu, for example—sell their own inventory, and maintain dedicated sales forces in order to do so. (Hulu, in fact, just announced that it would be launching its own private marketplace in which to sell that inventory.)
Amazon’s rise is also worth noting in that it helps confirm something many have been speculating about, the fact that Roku and Amazon appear to be running away with the both the advertising and consumer markets on OTT.
While Roku has already made its move to also control the smart TV interface (over 25% of all smart TVs in the U.S. use the Roku OS), Amazon is starting to making a play there too, striking a deal with Best Buy this summer to put the Fire TV OS on the retailer’s house brand Insignia TVs.
Smart Companies, Bad Moves
Roku and Amazon’s rise is bad news for Google and Apple, the two other players in the connected device market, but they really only have themselves to blame.
Google’s Chromecast device was an early hit, as it was one of the first streaming devices out of the box, but its lack of both an external remote control and an on-screen interface soon proved to be major issues for consumers, who did not want to have to use their smartphones to control their TV sets. Google could have easily remedied that by introducing both features, and their curious decision not to has left them trailing Roku and now Amazon.
Apple’s mistakes are even more curious.
While the Apple TV is a fine device, it sells for $179 and there’s absolutely nothing about it justifies that sort of price differential—in fact many find the $29 entry-level Rokus and Fire Sticks to be superior devices.
What’s puzzling with Apple is that they’ve been here before: when the old school iPod proved too expensive for much of the market, Apple rolled out the low-priced Nano and even lower-priced Shuffle to fill in the gap. Why they haven’t done the same with Apple TV is anyone’s guess.
Apple seems to be largely uninterested in any sort of CTV advertising play, but their new Apple TV app, the one they’re spending billions of dollars on, allegedly relies on viewers having an Apple TV to watch it on, and if very few people actually have an Apple TV, it’s going to be an uphill battle to get them to go out and spend $179 on one just to watch Apple's new programming. Especially when all five of the competing “Flixes” are already on their Roku or Fire TV device.
Back To Advertising
The ad-supported OTT/CTV market should continue to boom this year. Brands love CTV because they get the benefits of television (engaging high production value video storytelling with massive reach) with the targeting abilities of digital.
Not to mention people who actually stay to watch the ads.
We can see that via another Beachfront stat, something they’re calling CTV’s “Video Completion Rate” and it’s at around 90% overall, with numbers as high as 95% for premium content providers.
Given that the launch of at least two of the new “Flixes”—Disney+ and “Warnerflix” is likely to greatly expand the amount of premium ad-supported content next year, 95% is a very nice completion rate to be able to wave in front of advertisers.
Still Room For Growth
A growth rate of over one thousand percent year-over-year is astounding in any business.
But given the rate at which ad-supported OTT and CTV are growing, we’re likely to see that kind of growth rate for the next several years as more viewers discover CTV and more advertisers discover CTV viewers.

Iowans planning to fly may need to get a new driver’s license.
Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, anyone who wants to fly on commercial airplanes or enter a federal building, such as a courthouse or military base, will need a Real ID.
The Real ID Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, requires licenses to be marked with a special insignia to indicate the holder has gone through additional steps to verify their identity.
Although the Iowa Department of Transportation has been issuing Real ID cards since 2013, only 36 percent of Iowans hold Real ID-marked driver’s licenses, according to Andrea Henry of the IDOT.
Real ID driver’s licenses have a gold star in the upper right-hand corner.
Real IDs will not be necessary to drive a car, but not having the gold star has the potential to cause security hassles and delays for travelers or those doing business in federal buildings, Henry said.
Not everyone will need a Real ID, Henry added.
Anyone who doesn’t plan to fly, visit federal facilities or nuclear power plants will not need the new license.
Also, a military ID or passport global entry card will provide the same access as a Real ID.
The Real ID doesn’t affect a person’s ability to use their driver’s license to make age-regulated purchases, such as alcohol and cigarettes, or to gamble at Iowa casinos, Henry said.
The IDOT is encouraging Iowans to get their Real ID driver’s licenses sooner rather than later.
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT
To spread the word, IDOT and the Transportation Security Administration will host an information session a 1 p.m. Tuesday at the Des Moines International Airport.
To obtain the Real ID insignia, IDOT must see documents that prove:
• Identity, such as a certified copy of a U.S. birth certificate, U.S. passport, employment authorization document, permanent resident card or foreign passport with an approved form I-94.
• Social Security number, such as an Social Security card, W-2, or pay stub with full number.
• Residency, such as a rental or lease agreement, mortgage bill, utility bill or employment, medical or school document.
• An original or certified copy of a name change document, such as a marriage certificate or divorce decree, may be required.
Most people make the change when renewing their driver’s license, Henry said. There’s no extra cost to get the Real ID designation when renewing a license. If a driver’s license is not up for renewal, a replacement card will cost $10.
Opposition to the Real ID Act that was passed in 2005 came from both sides of the political spectrum and delayed its implementation.
The Tea Party was concerned it would give the federal government access to all types of information, including medical and criminal histories. The ACLU had similar concerns, warning that Real ID could lead to national databases used to track individuals.

Fried foods can be pretty darn delicious. But they're often dripping with fatty grease, which is both a little gross and a potential health hazard if consumed in excess. That's where air fryers come in, as a way to “fry” food without drenching them in oil.
When deciding whether or not to buy an air fryer, it’s important to ask yourself why you want one. Air fryers won't produce the greasy crunch of traditional fried foods, but they'll definitely deliver a crisp exterior and moist interior without the need for a gallon of oil. How? The air fryers circulate hot air around the food inside, cooking food at a fraction of the time a typical oven requires.
If an air fryer is for you, there are a lot of options out there. Luckily, we've done the research so you don't have to.

In half a dozen states, including the most populous state of California, the Real ID rollout is a real mess.
Technical glitches, delays and miscommunication are roiling the Real ID implementation in those states, calling into question whether residents will have the secure driver’s license needed to travel by air or enter government restricted areas after October 2020.
In California and Maryland, miscommunication between the state motor vehicle departments and the federal Department of Homeland Security about which documents are required to prove residency have sent the states and residents scrambling to recertify Real IDs that were already issued but are no longer valid.
A handful of other states initially delayed implementation by passing laws saying they would not comply for various reasons, from privacy concerns to objections to federal mandates. DHS granted those states more time but is refusing further extensions — and has warned states that if they don’t comply, their residents will need passports to board planes. That brought those states on board, but they are running behind in their efforts.
Some of the states are shifting resources to the problem, finding they must hire more personnel and spend extra money to comply by the deadline.
DHS has postponed the original deadline of 2008 many times since the Real ID law was enacted in 2005, but the department says it has no plans to extend the Oct. 1, 2020, deadline.
After that date, only driver’s licenses that meet the Real ID security standards can be used to board commercial airline fights or enter a secure federal building such as a military base. The Real ID Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, requires licenses to be marked with a special insignia or star, indicating that holders have gone through extra steps to prove their identity.
In general, that requires identification documents, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate (for name changes) and original Social Security card, plus two proofs of residency in that state, such as credit card or utility bills, vehicle registration or a bank statement.
A Real ID will not be required to drive a car, so anyone not planning air travel or to enter a secure federal building will not need one. But people lacking the ID who want to board a plane would have to bring another valid document, such as a passport or global entry card.
TSA, which secures U.S. airports, anticipates some confusion come October 2020.
Lisa Farbstein, a spokeswoman for the TSA, envisioned a future traveler with nonrefundable plane tickets:
“They step up to the TSA checking station, and if they don’t have a Real ID, the officer is going to say, ‘I’m sorry, this ID is no longer valid,’” Farbstein said. “There is somebody who is between a rock and a hard place.”
While that person may plead with their airline, she added, TSA won’t budge. “That’s why it’s important to do this sooner rather than later,” she said. “TSA knows a thing or two about what people think about waiting in lines.”
In addition to Real IDs, some states along the northern and southern borders are offering an “enhanced” driver’s license, which allows freer passage between the United States and Canada or Mexico. That, too, will work for getting on a plane. The enhanced driver’s licenses are offered in only a few states to only U.S. citizens.
While TSA is putting out public service announcements about the new IDs, notices at the state level vary.
States Scrambling
Maryland began complying with the Real ID law in 2009, requiring new residents or those getting licenses for the first time to provide extra documentation “under a process that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security deemed compliant,” according to Charles Brown, spokesman for the Maryland Department of Transportation and the state Motor Vehicle Administration.
That process required proof of residency and proof of identity, such as Social Security cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates or other identification. The state started issuing Real ID license renewals in 2016. “However, in October 2017, DHS informed Maryland that all customers with a driver’s license or identification card containing the Real ID star, which we began issuing in 2016, must have documents on file” with the departments, Brown said in an email.
As a result, 1 million residents who held the Real ID card had to make a return trip to the MVA so that the state could put copies of their proof of identification and residency on file. The state is scheduling them in groups.
The federal Department of Homeland Security refused to comment on the situation in Maryland and other states, despite repeated requests.
More than 2 million of Maryland’s 5 million licensed drivers are Real ID compliant, Brown said. For customers, Maryland is extending hours at MVA offices, opening satellite offices, allowing customers to set up appointments and pledging that the process will take only 15 minutes if an appointment is made. A recent trip to an MVA office in Beltsville revealed long lines but a sense of urgency by staff members to adhere to the 15-minute time frame.
In notices to Maryland divers, the state threatened that failing to meet the new requirements would “result in a recall of your Maryland driver’s license or identification card.” Many residents scrambled to comply.
California, with more than 26 million drivers, faced a similar problem. California DMV spokesman Jaime Garza also blamed changing DHS standards for creating the mess.
“The US Department of Homeland Security unexpectedly changed its originally approved method by which the CA DMV collected two proofs of residency,” Garza wrote in an email. “CA had followed the same DHS approved method that the state of Wisconsin was using to collect two proofs residency.”
The approved Wisconsin procedure would have allowed residents to respond to a letter from the DMV with a “return receipt requested” designation, sending in one proof of residency, with the mailing itself counting as the second proof. Garza provided Stateline with a 2017 letter from DHS official Steve Yonkers, director of the Real ID program, to the Wisconsin DMV approving that process. California based its procedure on the Wisconsin procedure, with DHS’s approval, Garza said. But Wisconsin ultimately went with in-person applications.
But a DHS letter to California in November 2018 reversed that directive, Garza said, saying the process “does not comply” with the Real ID law. That threw the state into a tizzy, he said.
Now, California is sending letters to all residents who provided only one proof of residency, asking them to sign, date and return the letter in a prepaid envelope as a second proof that was not required the first time. Unlike Maryland, California is not requiring drivers to make a return trip to the DMV. “The goal was to make this process as easy and convenient as possible for Californians,” Garza said, noting that it affects 3.6 million Californians holding Real IDs.
But the state has had a big increase in residents crowding into DMVs because of the confusion. Like Maryland, Garza said, California has increased office hours and hired 2,000 additional employees.
Late Adopters
Some states are lagging in issuing Real IDs in part because they fought the idea from the beginning. Seventeen states passed laws restricting or banning its implementation.
Those states get little sympathy from Republican U.S. Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, author of the 2005 law.
“The Real ID Act was a key recommendation of the 9-11 Commission to protect Americans from another devastating act of terrorism,” he said in an email. “States have had more than 14 years to comply with the law, and the Department of Homeland Security has provided additional funding to help along the way.”
Much of the opposition came from tea party Republicans who excoriated the Real ID law as an attack on privacy.
Scott Hofstra, chairman of the Central Kentucky Tea Party Patriots, said in a phone interview that his group is worried the federal bureaucrats at the top of DHS could get all kinds of information on cardholders, including medical and criminal histories.
“It takes away a lot of our privacy on the state level and gives it to the Department of Homeland Security,” Hofstra said. “The head of the DHS could tell the state, ‘I want you to list all their medical records on their driver’s license, or criminal records on their driver’s license.’ That’s from one unelected bureaucrat.”
Hofstra, an aircraft maintenance supervisor from Vine Grove, Kentucky, said he will get a Real ID only if his job requires it. To fly, he will use a passport.
Opposition also came from liberal groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, on privacy grounds. The group contended that despite the state-by-state nature of the Real IDs, information would be “consolidated into a national database,” which could be used to track individuals.
The ACLU sued to block implementation of Real ID in New Jersey. The state settled with the group in 2012, agreeing to open the process to comment and suggestions from the public about implementation procedures. The rollout was delayed.
“In 2018, we were really far behind,” said B. Sue Fulton, chief administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, in a phone interview. “We were not ready for the customer volume that would be generated by implementing Real ID.”
In response, she said, the state hired 300 new full-time employees and revamped its licensing software, equipment, online services and procedures. Now, she thinks the state will have fulfilled the requirements by October next year and avoid some of the problems faced in other states, even those that started earlier.
“What gives me the confidence is that we learned so much from other states,” she said. “We shouldn’t have to backtrack, which some of the states had to do.”
Kentucky, one of the states that resisted the law because of opposition from the tea party and other privacy advocates, is just now starting the Real ID process, with new licenses expected in January 2020.
In 2016, the Kentucky legislature passed legislation requiring the Real ID process to start. Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, vetoed it, saying “it has become increasingly clear that there is tremendous opposition and misunderstanding about the bill.”
After getting a federal extension, Kentucky again passed the legislation in 2017. Bevin, to spare Kentuckians from having to carry a passport to fly after their regular license stops working at airports, finally signed it.
Kentucky Transportation Cabinet spokeswoman Naitore Djigbenou said in a phone interview that it would take two years to get Real IDs to everyone who wants one. Nonetheless, she said she was confident that all Kentuckians who want the compliant license will be able to get one before the deadline.
“We are offering two options: a Real ID or a noncompliant card. Some prefer to use a passport to continue to fly,” she said. “This is completely voluntary. It’s not a requirement by any means.”
But Americans aren’t used to carrying a passport when traveling, according to Wayne Sandford, a University of New Haven professor of homeland security and emergency management and a former deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
He said states that started issuing Real IDs early mostly have fewer problems. “The states that said, ‘Nah, we’re not doing it, don’t worry about it, it will never be real’ are in trouble.”
“Now they realize their residents in their states need to have this done or carry a passport. For Americans this would be a really strange request. It’s not like it’s Europe where every country is a state, essentially.”
Sandford speculated that once this initial period of uncertainty and bureaucratic snafus passes, Americans will be pleased with how easily the new licenses allow them to travel. And he pooh-poohs privacy concerns.
Asked if he had privacy concerns, he said in a phone interview, “being from the other side and working in homeland security at the state level, I would say no, I don’t.” His years of working on homeland security issues, he said, have persuaded him that the goal is smooth travel, not invasions of privacy.
“I think it will actually make travel easier.”

Unless you were living under a rock, you know that Amazon Prime Day, literally the biggest blow out shopping event only rivaling the holidays, took place last week. Amazon created Prime Day out of thin air and, for itself and partners, and it has brought much of the industry out of its summer shopping doldrums. Even Walmart and Best Buy got into the action with their deals.
One of the many draws of Prime Day is Amazon’s first-party hardware. Kindle devices, Echo hardware, Fire tablets, and more, were all on sale during the event. Given the products’ low prices and feature sets, it should be no surprise that Prime Day was the biggest event ever for Amazon devices. What’s more, Prime Day was also the biggest event ever for Fire Amazon TV. The company shared the following tidbits:
Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick 4K: Top-selling deals worldwide were Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, and Fire TV Stick 4K with Alexa Voice Remote.
Top-selling deals worldwide were Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, and Fire TV Stick 4K with Alexa Voice Remote. Fire TV Edition Smart TV: Twice as many Fire TV Edition Smart TVs sold as of last year’s record-setting Prime Day adding to the millions already sold with solid brands like Toshiba and Insignia.
Twice as many Fire TV Edition Smart TVs sold as of last year’s record-setting Prime Day adding to the millions already sold with solid brands like Toshiba and Insignia. Fire TV Recast: July 15 was the best Amazon sales day for the Fire TV Recast, a DVR for cord-cutters.
The Fire TV sales success makes a lot of sense and not just because Prime Day was a huge shopping event, but also because this is where the streaming media player market is—consumers want powerful technology at affordable prices and Fire TV is what consumers want with its level of value and quality. Amazon has also increased its distribution and deepened its product lines. I have used every single Amazon Fire TV product except Smart TV Editions and what I really appreciate is that the experience gets better over time with software iterations adding features and improving UX. The home automation capabilities are the broadest and deepest, too.
First off, if it’s not evident, the market for cable boxes and cable services is being replaced by cord-cutting devices and services. The variety and accessibility of content are incredible, and all we have to do is look to the popularization of Netflix, Hulu, DirecTV Now, and Amazon Video. Along with an easy-to-use, 4K media experience, consumers also expect voice control, smart home control, and the ability to load apps like games, weather, and news. Fire TV devices deliver just that a killer price.
Fire TV devices now ship with the Alexa voice remote control including much easier to use volume control buttons. I’ll admit, volume control with voice works and is cool, but with many family members in the room, the volume buttons help a lot. It also helped that the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote was priced at $14.99, its lowest price ever. The 4K version was half-off at $24.99, a great deal.
While the Fire TV sales performance during Prime Days wasn’t a huge shocker to me, it’s nice to see some of the hard data that says it was. I believe it wasn’t just about the deals as the Fire TV family delivers a compelling consumer value proposition.

Vatican finds former Guam archbishop guilty of child sex abuse
The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's decision is final and no further appeals are possible

The Vatican has upheld its decision convicting the former Archbishop Anthony Apuron in the U.S. territory of Guam for sexually abusing minors.
"Our church on Guam can now continue with certainty, our collective journey toward healing and reconciliation. Most importantly, the victims, survivors and their families who have suffered greatly can have some measure of solace that justice has been rendered in the church's tribunal process," Archbishop Michael J. Byrnes of Agana, said of his predecessor.
The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith rejected an appeal by the now-former Archbishop Apuron upholding its earlier judgment of finding him guilty of abuse of minors.
The doctrinal tribunal's decision is final and no further appeals are possible, it said in a communique published April 4.
"We welcome this closure with great relief. We have needed it badly. It has been a long and painful period for our church and our island community as a whole," Archbishop Byrnes said in a statement released later in the day.
Vatican judges imposed the following penalties against Apuron: the privation of office; the perpetual prohibition from dwelling, even temporarily, in the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Agana, and the perpetual prohibition from using the insignia attached to the rank of bishop.
Apuron, 73, a Capuchin Fransican, was ordained a bishop in 1984 and he "sacramentally" remains a bishop, Alessandro Gisotti, interim director of the Vatican press office, told reporters April 4.
However, Bishop Apuron has been formally removed from the "office" of archbishop of Agana, where he was installed in 1986, and his removal from "ecclesiastical office" means he may no longer wear the usual "insignia" associated with it, such as a bishop's ring, miter and staff, Gisotti added.
Archbishop Byrnes, who was named coadjutor of the archdiocese in 2016, automatically becomes the archbishop of Agana, Gisotti said.
After conducting a canonical trial against Bishop Apuron, the apostolic tribunal of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith announced in March 2018 that it found Apuron guilty of several accusations against him, including the sexual abuse of minors.
However, the original statement never specified the number of charges the bishop faced.
Apuron was allowed to and did appeal the sentence and sanctions and said he was innocent. Because of the appeal, the imposed penalties were suspended until a final resolution.
Apuron left Guam in 2016 after he was accused of sexually assaulting four altar boys when he was a priest at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Agat.
His nephew later accused the priest of raping him in a Chancery bathroom nearly three decades ago when the boy was still a teenager.

Prime "Day" and its 48 hours of sales are now upon us. Deals are coming and going almost faster than they can be mentioned, but we'll do our best to keep this list up to date over the next two days. We're still in the process of adding items to this list — we have a lot to go through and piles of coupons to test — but in the meantime here are many of the current Prime Day promotions.
As always, our price comparisons are free of MSRP bloat whenever possible. With prices always changing, that sometimes means we'll have to express our discounts as a range (i.e.,"$30-50 off" or "up to $40 off"), which might be a bit more work for us, but it works out to a better understanding of the real discount for you. Just because Amazon says "you save: $300" doesn't make it true.
Many Prime Day deals will require that you be a Prime Member to snag them, so consider picking up a free 30-day trial if you aren't. Other deals may have to be triggered via Alexa commands (sometimes Amazon does that) so consider installing the Alexa app. You can also get an extra discount by playing with the camera features on the Amazon app and set alerts for upcoming deals within a certain window. Some in-page coupons may also not appear for everyone, which changes how good a few of the deals below are.
Lastly, although Prime Day is an Amazon event, several other retailers are taking advantage of the opportunity to discount their own products, too. When spotted, we have included them in this list as well, so you don't have to buy stuff from Amazon in some cases if you don't want to.
Now that you're a Prime Day expert, put on some holiday-appropriate music, and let's dive in.

A man has been jailed after he burgled a Nottinghamshire home and used the bank cards he stole from the property.
Simon Hinton, 50, formerly of Newthorpe Common, Newthorpe, appeared at Nottingham Crown Court on Tuesday, February 5, for sentencing after pleading guilty to one count of burglary and three counts of fraud by false representation.
Hinton was caught on CCTV and identified by police after a stolen bank card and credit card were used at a garage in Awsworth, in Nottinghamshire, on July 18 last year.
The cards were in a wallet stolen during a burglary at a property in Newthorpe, which happened between 1am and 5.30am on July 18.
Electrical items, house keys and the contents of a fridge were also taken.

He was jailed for two years and four months (876 days) for the burglary and received five-month prison sentences, to be served concurrently, for each of the fraud offences.
Speaking after Hinton's sentencing, Detective Inspector Steve Wragg, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "It’s good news that another burglar is now locked up.
"Our commitment to tackling and reducing burglaries is ongoing, with two new burglary teams continuing to work hard to tackle the issue in the city and county and bring offenders to justice.
"Tackling burglary remains a priority for the force. We won’t tolerate people committing this invasive and upsetting crime and we won’t stop targeting those we believe to be responsible for such crimes, which we know causes concern in our communities."

Just last week, DHL launched a new service to allow the unbanked in Southeast Asia to buy online through its Cross Border Cash-on-Delivery (COD) service. This follows other new-age players like Grab/Go-Jek aggressively launching initiatives of their own to provide financial services to people who don’t have banking accounts.
Banking services are synonymous with convenience. In modern society, making transfers, paying bills and making loans have all been enabled by banks and they have continued to innovate as we increasingly embraced technology. Many regional banks in Southeast Asia have created mobile applications, a solution seemingly tailor-made to the young population who access the mobile internet more than anybody else in the world.
However, banking penetration remains low in the region, with only 47% of the population in Southeast Asia having a bank account despite these new initiatives. This gap is highlighted particularly in the Philippines, where a staggering 77% of the population is unbanked, according to a recent survey by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. A similar magnitude of people are afflicted with the same problem in Vietnam and Indonesia at rates of 65% and 52% respectively. With this in mind, how can the unbanked be better served in the region?
Online platforms have to be augmented with offline network
“The supply of the banks can’t accommodate the burgeoning number of users. It’s the equivalent of being in Union Square in downtown San Francisco. The people in Mountain View and Oakland would find it difficult to get there,” said Hendra Kwik, CEO of Payfazz, an Indonesia-based mobile platform for financial services, in reference to the banking ecosystem in Indonesia. As most Indonesians store their money as cash, a tech-only approach to banking the population does not suffice. A physical presence is required to digitize the cash for consumers, and Payfazz hopes to provide a solution with its army of offline agents.
While technology makes life much easier for the masses, sometimes the masses are required to make technology work, and companies have to tailor their products to each individual market. For lesser developed areas of Southeast Asia, establishing a strong offline network is key.
Unconventional data is the new-age credit scoring
Consumers are not the only ones suffering from a lack of financial services, with only 33% of SMEs in Southeast Asia having access to loans and a line of credit. This prevents them from executing their growth plans effectively and limits their ability to scale quickly when demand surges. “There are 78 million small businesses in Southeast Asia, that’s three times more than the U.S.,” said Andrea Baronchelli, CEO of Aspire, a Singapore based company offering direct loans to SMEs.
SMEs often fail to get loans from banks due to their lack of credit history and assets for use as collateral. To counter the lack of credit history or collateral these SMEs face, Aspire’s proprietary risk assessment engine taps onto non-conventional data, such as business transactions, data from online accounting software, online ratings, and social activities to create a new-age credit scoring for SMEs.
In this era of social media, there are huge amounts of data freely available online. Customer feedback, ratings, and the traction of a company’s social media account can be used to determine the health of a business. Companies that have perfected the method of tapping this data will have a key competitive edge moving forward.
The need for speed to win over consumers
For the few companies who are fortunate to have their loans approved by banks, the approval often comes after extensive research and credit verification, which typically takes many weeks. SMEs often lack sufficient cashflow to deal with surges in demand and thus need capital quickly. New methods of credit verification and increased processing speed are therefore key in revolutionizing the traditional SME financing method and to help these businesses reach their full potential.
Patrick Lynch, the CEO of First Circle, a Philippines-based startup providing PO financing and invoice financing to SMEs, said, “A typical bank loan takes multiple in-person visits and months to process. First Circle uses a combination of trading history and network data to understand what each SME does and how they interact with their trading partners, cutting down the entire loan process to just 3 days.”
Embracing data analytics through their own proprietary software has allowed First Circle to safely underwrite tens of thousands of invoices for large SMEs as well as those with no credit history in a short amount of time.
Companies must innovate to stay agile, such as automation via data analytics. Additionally, the usage of collaborative cloud platforms and the flattening of decision-making processes will be key to maintaining a competitive edge.
In summary, innovation and adaptability is key
Southeast Asia internet economy is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years, with both customers and businesses starting to demand new frictionless and faster access to financial services. Adapting quickly to the ever-changing needs of consumers is a competitive advantage for startups. As Charles Darwin said, “It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change”.

QAIM, Iraq — Abu Sajjad’s desk is flanked by the Iraqi flag, the official Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) flag and that of Kataib al-Imam Ali, the fighting group of which he is the local commander. On the wall is a large map of the two sides of the border, which he and his men cross regularly. Wearing a T-shirt with the logo of the 1980s American film "Top Gun," Abu Sajjad’s muscular tattooed arms gesture as he talks animatedly about differences between Syria and Iraq, how the United States and Israel are trying to interfere in the country, and how the prime minister’s July 1 decree that the PMU be incorporated into other state security forces is good.
"We are men of the state, and we follow the law," he told Al-Monitor.
"The situation is stable here now. There is a bit of movement" of terrorist groups, he said, adding, "and the Islamic State (IS) is everywhere, but they are 'sleeping.'" He said, "Thanks be to God, the army, the police and SWAT are all here in the border area."
Civilians have repeatedly complained to Al-Monitor during several visits to the area since its liberation from Islamic State control in November 2017 about the dizzying array of security forces, some of whom do not wear insignia of any sort but carry weapons.

Abu Sajjad (a Kunya/nom de guerre) said in an interview in his office in the Husaybeh area of Qaim — which is very close to the border and almost across the street from the police headquarters — that Kataib al-Imam Ali now has "about 200 men" deployed in Albu Kamal in Syria, and they move back and forth across the border regularly.
"Here I can go out in the evening alone, dressed like this, whatever," he said, illustrating the difference between the two sides. He added, "There I need to go out with protection, in a military vehicle. And the Iranians don’t want any photos taken of anything."
Abu Sajjad referred to all the men around as his "brothers" and this correspondent as "sister."
Security is good in Qaim, with roadwork underway and services gradually improving.
Concern, however, remains that apparent dominance of the Iran-linked non-local forces and their continuing cross-border activities may lead to future problems.
The Sunni Anbar province has long been wary of if not hostile to the Shiite-led, non-local PMU presence.
Members of non-local PMU are seen near the Iraqi-Syrian border in Qaim, Iraq, July 7, 2019. (Shelly Kittleson/Al-Monitor)
Anbar encompasses roughly a third of the country but is less populated than many of the poor, job-hungry areas of the Shia south and crowded areas of Baghdad, which many PMU fighters are from. Outside of the fertile Euphrates River Valley are the desert and wadis in which insurgent groups have long found it relatively easy to hide.
The US-led international coalition and Iraqi air power are often used to conduct strikes on IS hideouts there, following tip-offs from local sources and surveillance.
Local security forces including the SWAT team, the police and local PMU now seem more accepting of non-local PMU presence than some months ago when discussing them online and in the presence of others.
This may, however, simply be pragmatic resignation. When alone with some in Qaim, Al-Monitor was told once again that the non-local PMU presence is a problem but nothing can be done.
One man said he is trying to find a way to leave because "Qaim is theirs now; they have control."
Another told Al-Monitor he could not meet with her there "given the situation."
Anbar military operations commander Mahmoud al-Falahi has recently been arrested for allegedly providing the coordinates of non-local PMU to a CIA agent for the purposes of bombing them. Recordings of what is allegedly his voice were released by Kataeb Hezbollah.
Abu Aya, former head of the Qaim SWAT team and now commander of the local PMU Kataeb al-Hamza, told Al-Monitor he seriously doubted the recordings were real and an officer of that rank would not be "that stupid."
After being asked whether any smuggling was continuing in this area, Abu Aya replied, "They don’t need to anymore. The border is open. You can see that."
On the country across the border, the Kataib al-Imam Ali commander said his group has "no contact with the Syrian regime’’ since it is a "Baathist regime, like Saddam [Hussein]'s."
"We are of course in contact with Iranian forces and our brothers in the Muqawama (resistance) he added.
Men in variegated camouflage attire lacking identifying insignia and guns slung over a shoulder can be seen on the main street of Qaim amid vegetable sellers, Zain phone company shops and money changers with large Qi signs on them, referring to debit cards that are being used by the government to send salaries to official PMU fighters.
SWAT members with this correspondent when she saw a group of three young armed men walking near the market said they did not know who the men were, but "they are probably Kataib Hezbollah. There are a lot of them here."
The concern that armed men may be able to disguise themselves and infiltrate the city was voiced by some of the security forces.
For now, non-local PMU control access from the east.
At a checkpoint just before entering the city, a soldier from the army looked at this correspondent’s Joint Operations Command authorization before pointing some meters down the road toward the PMU checkpoint and saying they would need to approve it.
The fighters from the Tufuf Brigade stationed there required that a commander from the non-local, Shia-led PMU approve the request. Phone calls ensued and about an hour was spent before contacts vouched for this correspondent.
Though Asaib Ahl al-Haq flags no longer fly from a major bridge — as they did to the dismay of many local inhabitants for weeks after the battle to retake the city — and insignia of the various individual PMU factions is seen even less, the influence of the various groups seems to have grown stronger over the past year and a half.
The prime minister’s decree is unlikely to change this. It may, however, render less transparent where specific units of the security forces are from and whether they have longstanding ties or informal alliances with Iran.

2018 is shaping up to set record numbers during the Holiday shopping season. Analysts are predicting $134 billion will be spent between November and December. That's a healthy 15.5% increase year over year. Retailers and electronics manufacturers alike are looking to capture their corner of the Holiday action. Everywhere you look, you can see signs that retailers are about to move a lot of TVs! Consumer confidence is at an all-time high. Sales of HDTVs exploded this time last year, moving an unbelievable 4x the amount of product as the previous three quarters. To put it another way, more HDTVs were sold during the fourth quarter than the rest of the year combined in 2017. 4K/UHDTV sales are predicted to skyrocket this year as well, selling nearly twice as many units as two years ago.
With so much money to be made, and confidence levels being so high, this could be a record-breaking year for TV sales. The biggest retailers are already moving in on the market, unveiling a ton of striking Holiday deals well before Black Friday/Cyber Monday.

Credit cards aren’t just a way to bag the most miles. For the elite and society’s bigwigs, all it takes is a flash of these cards for everything to fall into place. But like all things, including “It” bags, high-end jewellery and top-of-the-line cars, credit cards too exist in tiers, and at the very top are cards that are only available through invites. These credit cards are so exclusive that not anyone with a high net-worth can own them. Ahead, we’ve listed five of the most prestigious, by-invitation-only credit cards to own in Singapore.

1. American Express Centurion Card
It’s been name-dropped countless times in songs, movies and books. So exclusive (and elusive) is this card is that up to the 1990s, it was thought of as a myth — you won’t even find it on the Singapore site. What’s famously known about the card is its hefty annual fee, which is said to be more than $7,000. Of course, this could just mean petty change for its target clientele of the ultra-rich. In a nutshell, here’s why the Centurion card is so coveted: It’s the gateway to the best travel services out there, including a dedicated concierge and travel agent, access to swanky airport lounges, automatic elite status at luxury hotels and rooms, and first-class flight upgrades. The card also opens myriad doors — it grants you memberships to the most prestigious private members’ clubs and even personal shopper services.
2. DBS Insignia Visa Infinite
In terms of bragging rights, DBS Insignia Visa Infinite will certainly offer you that — it’s the first Singapore credit card to be fully metal. And it’s good-looking too, as it’s decked in bronze and gold plating and uses cursive etching for the cardholder’s name. For new clientele, the welcome bonus is enormous; upon joining, you’ll be rewarded with 100,000 air miles. It’s not hard to fathom why the card is so desired: It has a credit limit is $1 million and offers significant benefits. You get luxurious two-night stays at more than 40 luxury hotels and resorts in Asia, unlimited Priority Pass membership for access to over 1,000 airport lounges globally as well as airport speedpass access for fast track immigration in airports within Asia.

3. Citi Ultima
For an annual fee of almost $4,000 a year, Citi Ultima assigns you a major asset: A Lifestyle Relationship Manager to cater to not only your credit card preferences but your investments, shopping needs or whims and fancies. The customised services hardly stop there. As the second most expensive credit card in Singapore, you can expect incredible rewards. Cardholders receive a Diamond with Hilton Honours, which gives you the best perks for your hotel stays, luxury retail, top restaurants as well as unlimited Priority Passes.
4. UOB Reserve Card
Have at least $2 million in your reserves and you may be invited to own the UOB Reserve card. Like other by-invitation-only credit cards, the UOB Reserve Card offers myriad travel and lifestyle benefits, including special First or Business class fares, and access to ritzy airport lounges across the globe, as well as complimentary memberships to hospitality clubs. But what this card reportedly has above the others is this: Cardholders are able to purchase unlimited discounted miles from UOB at a rate of $19 per 1,000 miles.
5. Maybank Visa Infinite Card
Black credit cards often symbolise wealth, status and success and the Maybank Visa Infinite is no exception. True to its Visa Infinite family, the card offers its upscale clientele a wealth of travelling privileges. Live the jet-set life with VIP treatments: Kick off your transatlantic travel in style with complimentary limousine airport transfers and access to Changi Airport’s private terminal. Then, breeze through immigration with fast-track passes and luxuriate in world-class lounges in between transits. While you’re abroad, use your card to earn as many miles as possible. Every $1 spent in foreign transactions earns you five Treats Points, which is equivalent to two air miles.

Story 96
On Monday night, HBO aired the two-hour documentary The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley, a much-anticipated companion piece to the gathering slew of fascinating investigative stories about Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. In 2018, Holmes was indicted and charged with federal fraud several years after the Wall Street Journal’s John Carreyrou initially reported that her company’s game-changing technology, which was supposed to be able to run hundreds of different medical tests using only a single drop of blood, wasn’t functioning.
For diehard followers of the Theranos saga who’ll gobble up any and all scraps of new information, The Inventor contained little that hadn’t previously been explored in Carreyrou’s excellent book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup and in the longform ABC podcast The Dropout. One exception was the film’s focus on an ad that was produced as part of a Theranos collaboration with Walgreens, which showed an elderly woman moved to tears by her daughter’s concern for her health.
Subscribe to Observer’s Daily Newsletter
The ad’s purpose was to promote Theranos gift cards, which got us wondering about the physical evidence of the company’s existence and where it had dispersed to—sample processing units, paperweights branded with their logo, etc. Few physical objects that the company manufactured are readily available, but what we found was that new, Theranos-branded merch is now being made.
The online retailer Redbubble, which sells trendy merchandise based on user-submitted designs, offers more than 55 products bearing the Theranos logo on its platform, all of which appear to have been made by a prolific designer (or team of designers) going by the name Millennial Society, or MillSociety for short. It’s not clear whether anyone at MillSociety is associated with Theranos (they did not respond to Observer’s request for comment by the time of publication).
Anyone who’s ever sold “Yankees Suck” shirts to Red Sox fans knows that there’s a great deal of money to be made in manufacturing goods that play into an ongoing controversy, but still, it’s a little bit jarring to scroll through dozens of images of young, smiling models outfitted in flattering Theranos attire. There are Theranos v-neck T-shirts, hoodies, travel mugs, tote bags and iPad cases. There’s a Theranos wall tapestry, a Theranos clock and Theranos postcards. There’s a hardcover Theranos journal. For the true die-hard Holmes-obsessed, there’s even a provocative Theranos mini skirt; a total steal at $33.84. From a Florida-based business called Sunshine T Shirts, you can buy a sporty t-shirt bearing the phrase “I think my soulmate is Elizabeth Holmes.” Sunshine also offers a shirt that reads “It’s an Elizabeth Holmes thing, you wouldn’t understand.” My personal favorite, though, is MillSociety’s Theranos duvet cover. It’s perfect for insomniac scammers-in-training.
But wait, as they say; there’s more. On eBay, a highly-rated seller has listed a “Drucker Theranos Programmable 6-Tube 6500 RPM Centrifuge,” which bears the Theranos insignia and appears to be a laboratory device like the kind used by the company to prepare blood samples for testing. “Centrifuge has been tested working onsite!” the eBay description reads. “Centrifuge has wear from previous use including scuffs and scratches. Unit also has some wear on the seals.” The machine has been priced at $499.99, and is listed as being currently located in Rancho Cordova, California.
Theranos was once a company that was worth billions of dollars, so it seems logical that bits and pieces of its physical existence are both tangible and available for sale to the highest bidder, but there’s an eerie quality to these objects all the same.
This might be because Holmes’ staggeringly brazen conduct during her years as the CEO of Theranos has persisted as she awaits her day in court. Despite being accused of both hoodwinking investors out of billions of dollars and deceiving hundreds of physicians and patients (potentially putting them in harm’s way), Holmes has remained stoic, inscrutable and even visibly cheerful; acting for all the world like a squeaky-clean upstart just biding her time between projects.
Ultimately, the Theranos logo doesn’t belong on coffee mugs or medical devices because the idea that Theranos represented never actually existed: the company was an elaborate cloud of hot air, laced with just enough Elizabeth Holmes magic to convince the right people their work was both solid and groundbreaking. It’s natural to be fascinated by this still-unfolding story of corporate intrigue and technological incompetence, but in the age where everything you’re obsessed with can be worn on a sweatshirt, the Theranos scandal demonstrates that some obsessions are too complicated to be screen-printed.

Throughout Homecoming, the new Netflix documentary chronicling Beyoncé’s monumental performance at the 2018 Coachella music festival, quotes from distinguished black creatives and intellectuals appear at various points, serving as interstitial title cards between footage of the concert and its tireless gestation. They include WEB DuBois, Nina Simone, Toni Morrison and Reginald Lewis, suggesting not only Beyoncé’s reverence for her forerunners but her own by-now-unequivocal stature in the pantheon of black American greatness.
'The swag is limitless': why Beyoncé's Beychella Homecoming is so radical | Candice Carty-Williams Read more
The most potent of these quotes, however, the one most illustrative of the resplendent and genuinely paradigm-shifting show Beyoncé put on in Indio, comes from Audre Lorde. “Without community,” Lorde said in a speech delivered exactly 40 years ago, “there is no liberation.” Beyoncé, joined on stage by more than 200 performers, turns that soundbite into triumphant roar, crafting an experience whose emphasis on the whole – the masterfully synchronized and color-coordinated corps of dancers, back-up singers, majorettes, trumpet players, et al – gives it the feeling of visual, aural communion.
And yet, despite her willingness to share the stage, Beyoncé is the priestess, the ringleader, insistent on her authorship of this one-of-a-kind spectacle, which marked the first time a black woman had ever headlined Coachella. The writer, director and executive producer of Homecoming, which runs 137 minutes and was released in concert with a 40-song live album, Beyoncé has a way of reminding us of her unique ability to hold a crowd in the palm of her hand, to defy the trend toward cultural diffusion and force us to stand at attention.
She did it first in 2013, with the surprise drop of her eponymous visual album. Then again with Lemonade, for which I and countless others forsook our Saturday night plans to watch immediately, as though it were some kind of presidential fireside chat. Coachella 2018 was her hat-trick, and Homecoming, with its savvy structure and breakneck editing, is a joyful celebration of the performance, if not quite the look-behind-the-curtain one expects of the typical concert documentary.
This is, after all, Beyoncé, and her capacity for era-defining moments wouldn’t be what it is if she didn’t defend her right to privacy, to a room of her own. There’s no salacious backstage powwow with her dancers or simulations of oral sex on an Evian bottle, like Madonna in one of the all-time greats of the form, Truth or Dare. Nor is it the kind of scaled-back, cinéma vérité experience of Stop Making Sense, Jonathan Demme’s Talking Heads rockumentary. Homecoming is directed and performed with exacting precision, but it’s freewheeling too, its star favoring spliced and inventive arrangements of her hits, the totality of which make the film feel more like a pinnacle than a pilgrimage. Beyoncé speaks mostly in voiceover, maintaining a kind of phantom presence even in those rare moments of vulnerability, such as the revelations about her difficult pregnancy with twins, or her lifelong dream of attending an HBCU like her father. “My college was Destiny’s Child,” she says. “My college was traveling around the world, and life was my teacher.”
Beyoncé effect fills galleries with a new generation of art devotees Read more
So Coachella, she explains, was the homecoming she never had, but also a paean to the rich culture and vibrant aesthetic of historically black colleges and universities, the insignia of which can be spotted on the bright yellow and pink hoodies worn by Beyoncé and her onstage battalion (the film brilliantly cross-cuts between Beyoncé’s two Coachella sets to create an almost kaleidoscopic effect, edited down to each gyration and stutter-step). And even with the relative sparsity of information about how the concept came together, Homecoming is, alongside the southern gothic feminism of Lemonade, Beyoncé’s grandest articulation yet of her artistic mission. It’s a mission so great, she looks to no less an authority than Maya Angelou to put it into words. “What I really want to do is be a representative of my race,” Angelou says over grainy rehearsal footage near the end of the documentary, in what was the last interview she gave before her death in 2014. “I know that when I’m finished doing what I’m sent here to do, I will be called home.”
Home, for Beyoncé, is the stage. It simply agrees with her, as does every light source, camera angle and audience member, many of whom are seen howling blissfully in the crowd, gobsmacked with pride and hero-worship. But Beyoncé, queen she may be, doesn’t ask us to bend the knee. Homecoming is about the collective. It’s about the experience of viral, transitory togetherness for which musical festivals are one of the last remaining conduits. Beyoncé lets us see as much of the sweat as she’s willing, and some will perhaps want more. But she’s less interested in unraveling the mythology than letting us plebeians revel in it.

In half a dozen states, including the most populous state of California, the Real ID rollout is a real mess.
Technical glitches, delays and miscommunication are roiling the Real ID implementation in those states, calling into question whether residents will have the secure driver’s license needed to travel by air or enter government restricted areas after October 2020.
In California and Maryland, miscommunication between the state motor vehicle departments and the federal Department of Homeland Security about which documents are required to prove residency have sent the states and residents scrambling to recertify Real IDs that were already issued but are no longer valid.
A handful of other states initially delayed implementation by passing laws saying they would not comply for various reasons, from privacy concerns to objections to federal mandates. DHS granted those states more time but is refusing further extensions — and has warned states that if they don’t comply, their residents will need passports to board planes. That brought those states on board, but they are running behind in their efforts.
Some of the states are shifting resources to the problem, finding they must hire more personnel and spend extra money to comply by the deadline.
DHS has postponed the original deadline of 2008 many times since the Real ID law was enacted in 2005, but the department says it has no plans to extend the Oct. 1, 2020, deadline.
After that date, only driver’s licenses that meet the Real ID security standards can be used to board commercial airline flights or enter a secure federal building such as a military base. The Real ID Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, requires licenses to be marked with a special insignia or star, indicating that holders have gone through extra steps to prove their identity.
In general, that requires identification documents, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate (for name changes) and original Social Security card, plus two proofs of residency in that state, such as credit card or utility bills, vehicle registration or a bank statement.
A Real ID will not be required to drive a car, so anyone not planning air travel or to enter a secure federal building will not need one. But people lacking the ID who want to board a plane would have to bring another valid document, such as a passport or global entry card.
TSA, which secures U.S. airports, anticipates some confusion come October 2020.
Lisa Farbstein, a spokeswoman for the TSA, envisioned a future traveler with nonrefundable plane tickets:
“They step up to the TSA checking station, and if they don’t have a Real ID, the officer is going to say, ‘I’m sorry, this ID is no longer valid,’” Farbstein said. “There is somebody who is between a rock and a hard place.”
While that person may plead with their airline, she added, TSA won’t budge. “That’s why it’s important to do this sooner rather than later,” she said. “TSA knows a thing or two about what people think about waiting in lines.”
In addition to Real IDs, some states along the northern and southern borders are offering an “enhanced” driver’s license, which allows freer passage between the United States and Canada or Mexico. That, too, will work for getting on a plane. The enhanced driver’s licenses are offered in only a few states to only U.S. citizens.
While TSA is putting out public service announcements about the new IDs, notices at the state level vary.
States Scrambling
Maryland began complying with the Real ID law in 2009, requiring new residents or those getting licenses for the first time to provide extra documentation “under a process that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security deemed compliant,” according to Charles Brown, spokesman for the Maryland Department of Transportation and the state Motor Vehicle Administration.
That process required proof of residency and proof of identity, such as Social Security cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates or other identification. The state started issuing Real ID license renewals in 2016. “However, in October 2017, DHS informed Maryland that all customers with a driver’s license or identification card containing the Real ID star, which we began issuing in 2016, must have documents on file” with the departments, Brown said in an email.
As a result, 1 million residents who held the Real ID card had to make a return trip to the MVA so that the state could put copies of their proof of identification and residency on file. The state is scheduling them in groups.
The federal Department of Homeland Security refused to comment on the situation in Maryland and other states, despite repeated requests.
More than 2 million of Maryland’s 5 million licensed drivers are Real ID compliant, Brown said. For customers, Maryland is extending hours at MVA offices, opening satellite offices, allowing customers to set up appointments and pledging that the process will take only 15 minutes if an appointment is made. A recent trip to an MVA office in Beltsville revealed long lines but a sense of urgency by staff members to adhere to the 15-minute time frame.
In notices to Maryland divers, the state threatened that failing to meet the new requirements would “result in a recall of your Maryland driver’s license or identification card.” Many residents scrambled to comply.
California, with more than 26 million drivers, faced a similar problem. California DMV spokesman Jaime Garza also blamed changing DHS standards for creating the mess.
“The US Department of Homeland Security unexpectedly changed its originally approved method by which the CA DMV collected two proofs of residency,” Garza wrote in an email. “CA had followed the same DHS approved method that the state of Wisconsin was using to collect two proofs residency.”
The approved Wisconsin procedure would have allowed residents to respond to a letter from the DMV with a “return receipt requested” designation, sending in one proof of residency, with the mailing itself counting as the second proof. Garza provided Stateline with a 2017 letter from DHS official Steve Yonkers, director of the Real ID program, to the Wisconsin DMV approving that process. California based its procedure on the Wisconsin procedure, with DHS’s approval, Garza said. But Wisconsin ultimately went with in-person applications.
But a DHS letter to California in November 2018 reversed that directive, Garza said, saying the process “does not comply” with the Real ID law. That threw the state into a tizzy, he said.
Now, California is sending letters to all residents who provided only one proof of residency, asking them to sign, date and return the letter in a prepaid envelope as a second proof that was not required the first time. Unlike Maryland, California is not requiring drivers to make a return trip to the DMV. “The goal was to make this process as easy and convenient as possible for Californians,” Garza said, noting that it affects 3.6 million Californians holding Real IDs.
But the state has had a big increase in residents crowding into DMVs because of the confusion. Like Maryland, Garza said, California has increased office hours and hired 2,000 additional employees.
Late Adopters
Some states are lagging in issuing Real IDs in part because they fought the idea from the beginning. Seventeen states passed laws restricting or banning its implementation.
Those states get little sympathy from Republican U.S. Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, author of the 2005 law.
“The Real ID Act was a key recommendation of the 9-11 Commission to protect Americans from another devastating act of terrorism,” he said in an email. “States have had more than 14 years to comply with the law, and the Department of Homeland Security has provided additional funding to help along the way.”
Much of the opposition came from tea party Republicans who excoriated the Real ID law as an attack on privacy.
Scott Hofstra, chairman of the Central Kentucky Tea Party Patriots, said in a phone interview that his group is worried the federal bureaucrats at the top of DHS could get all kinds of information on cardholders, including medical and criminal histories.
“It takes away a lot of our privacy on the state level and gives it to the Department of Homeland Security,” Hofstra said. “The head of the DHS could tell the state, ‘I want you to list all their medical records on their driver’s license or criminal records on their driver’s license.’ That’s from one unelected bureaucrat.”
Hofstra, an aircraft maintenance supervisor from Vine Grove, said he will get a Real ID only if his job requires it. To fly, he will use a passport.
Opposition also came from liberal groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, on privacy grounds. The group contended that despite the state-by-state nature of the Real IDs, information would be “consolidated into a national database,” which could be used to track individuals.
The ACLU sued to block implementation of Real ID in New Jersey. The state settled with the group in 2012, agreeing to open the process to comment and suggestions from the public about implementation procedures. The rollout was delayed.
“In 2018, we were really far behind,” said B. Sue Fulton, chief administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, in a phone interview. “We were not ready for the customer volume that would be generated by implementing Real ID.”
In response, she said, the state hired 300 new full-time employees and revamped its licensing software, equipment, online services and procedures. Now, she thinks the state will have fulfilled the requirements by October next year and avoid some of the problems faced in other states, even those that started earlier.
“What gives me the confidence is that we learned so much from other states,” she said. “We shouldn’t have to backtrack, which some of the states had to do.”
Kentucky, one of the states that resisted the law because of opposition from the tea party and other privacy advocates, is just now starting the Real ID process, with new licenses expected in January 2020.
In 2016, the Kentucky legislature passed legislation requiring the Real ID process to start. Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, vetoed it, saying “it has become increasingly clear that there is tremendous opposition and misunderstanding about the bill.”
After getting a federal extension, Kentucky again passed the legislation in 2017. Bevin, to spare Kentuckians from having to carry a passport to fly after their regular license stops working at airports, finally signed it.
Kentucky Transportation Cabinet spokeswoman Naitore Djigbenou said in a phone interview that it would take two years to get Real IDs to everyone who wants one. Nonetheless, she said she was confident that all Kentuckians who want the compliant license will be able to get one before the deadline.
“We are offering two options: a Real ID or a noncompliant card. Some prefer to use a passport to continue to fly,” she said. “This is completely voluntary. It’s not a requirement by any means.”
But Americans aren’t used to carrying a passport when traveling, according to Wayne Sandford, a University of New Haven professor of homeland security and emergency management and a former deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
He said states that started issuing Real IDs early mostly have fewer problems. “The states that said, ‘Nah, we’re not doing it, don’t worry about it, it will never be real’ are in trouble.”
“Now they realize their residents in their states need to have this done or carry a passport. For Americans, this would be a really strange request. It’s not like it’s Europe where every country is a state, essentially.”
Sandford speculated that once this initial period of uncertainty and bureaucratic snafus passes, Americans will be pleased with how easily the new licenses allow them to travel. And he pooh-poohs privacy concerns.
Asked if he had privacy concerns, he said in a phone interview, “being from the other side and working in homeland security at the state level, I would say no, I don’t.” His years of working on homeland security issues, he said, have persuaded him that the goal is smooth travel, not invasions of privacy.
“I think it will actually make travel easier.”

There are a number of stand out deals on this list. Probably my personal favorite would be the Sony XBR-55X900F for $1,098. This 55in TV (the 65-inch version is reviewed here) uses direct LED lighting, where the LEDs sit right behind the screen, with local dimming and outstanding Sony picture processing to deliver one of the best 55-inch 4K and high dynamic range pictures around right now.
The Sony X850Fs, on the other hand, are best avoided, due to their use of low-contrast IPS LCD panel designs.

Samsung’s QN55Q7F is also a stand out deal. This is edge lit rather than direct lit (the Samsung QN55Q8F reviewed here is another good option if you want to step up to a direct-lit set), but it still delivers a bright, impactful, color-rich HDR experience thanks to its use of Samsung’s QLED Quantum Dot technology.
Don’t confuse the QN55Q7F with the QN55Q7C, by the way, as the latter model is curved rather than flat, meaning it costs more while actually delivering a slightly inferior contrast performance.
If you’re in the market for a really big TV, the lure of QLED technology also makes the price of under $2,000 for the Samsung QN75Q6 look very tempting. Though note that the Q6 range does not offer the level of localized backlight control and contrast that you get with the step up Q7F range.
Samsung catches the eye once more with its 65in 65NU8000. This doesn’t use QLED technology, but it’s still a high performance, HDR-friendly edge-lit LED TV that looks a steal at $997.99.
Finally, the deals on a range of LG LED TVs include some seriously hefty discounts, making them a potential option for bright room viewing. I stress the viewing conditions, since all of these LG models use IPS LCD panels that aren’t well suited to use in dark rooms. Especially when watching films, which tend to be rich in contrast.

While many prepaid credit cards bear the insignia of well-known credit card brands such as VISA or MASTERCARD, these aren't credit cards at all.
In fact, contrary to the name, you cannot purchase anything unless there is already money on the card. The card requires no application or credit check and sometimes, you cannot withdraw money from any bank machines with it either.
Not every retailer will accept the card. These cards will often carry a phrase such "Valid only in Canada" and many cannot be used with those card machines retailers have to process debit or real credit cards.
Some parents have started giving out these cards to their children as a way of introducing them to credit use while also limiting their spending. Each card has an amount that's been purchased by someone.
The cards are also useful for online purchases or buying over the phone. They are popular as gifts during the holiday season as well.
Unfortunately, anyone hoping to polish their credit history will be shortchanged. The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) says non-credit products and prepaid cards do not boost credit scores.
There are also other pitfalls to these cards:
They have charges per transaction, averaging about 39-cents each.
They have a monthy service fee after an initial six-month grace period.
They contain other fees (which include service support, activation fee etc...) which can easily make the card too costly to continue with.
Many consumers are also unaware these cards have had an expiry date — any amount on the card is automatically lost if not used up. Fortunately, new rules being implemented by the federal government will do away with the expiry date.
What to consider:

The Europe-sourced Holden Commodore could be in line to receive a new engine.
Holden’s sister brands, Opel and Vauxhall, have introduced a fresh 1.6-litre four-cylinder turbo petrol engine for the Insignia hatch.
Using around 5.2L/100km to produce 147kW and 280Nm outputs, the new engine is more efficient but less punchy than the 2.0-litre turbo engine currently offered in local examples.
The powerplant appears to have replaced that 191kW/350Nm turbo petrol engine in some markets, raising questions about the engine’s future in Australia.
Australian examples of the Commodore - sold overseas of the Insignia - are powered by some of the more powerful engines from the General Motors arsenal. The Commodore is sold here with a 2.0-litre turbo engine serving up 191kW, a 3.6-litre V6 with 235kW and a 2.0-litre turbo diesel with 125kW and 400Nm, surpassing less powerful options such as a 103kW 1.5-litre turbo petrol and 81kW 1.6-litre turbo diesel options sold overseas.
UPDATE: Holden says it "will be continuing with our current powertrain line-up for the ZB Commodore". We'll bring future Commodore news as it arises.

This story has been corrected to say that two of the women in the video, rather than four as it originally stated, are American Airlines flight attendants.
A video that apparently shows four women, including two off-duty American Airlines flight attendants, performing a burlesque-like routine has drawn the ire of two American unions.
The airline said it had nothing to do with the video, which was posted by The Forward Cabin, an airline industry-oriented site that offers comments on airline miles and points awards.
The unions and the airline engaged in a Sunday afternoon battle of prepared statements. The video was deleted once it became controversial.
The video shows four women, fully clothed in flight attendant-like uniforms, dancing and making comedic statements about air travel as they surround a man who portrays an airline passenger seated in a premium seat. A large American Airlines insignia is displayed on the stage. Two of the women are Dallas-based flight attendants
The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents 26,000 American flight attendants, demanded an investigation.
The video showed “individuals portrayed as flight attendants promoting sex appeal as an attraction to AA’s most prominent and lucrative passengers,” APFA said in its statement, which was entitled, “American Airlines Flight Attendant Union Demands Investigation Into Company’s Involvement in Demeaning Sex Object Video.”
“This cannot be happening in today’s environment. We will not tolerate our profession being objectified in a sexist manner,” said APFA National President Lori Bassani. “We want the facts about the company’s involvement and we want answers.”
The Transport Workers Union released a statement saying that American CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom have developed a business plan: “Destroy blue collar America and expose air travelers to potential disaster by fixing AA planes on foreign soil, while simultaneously sexualizing and degrading their own flight attendants.”
TWU and the International Association of Machinists jointly represent about 14,700 mechanics and related employees and about 17,000 fleet service workers.
American said that it “saw a customer’s social media post depicting a group of American flight attendants at a customer-organized and hosted event.
"What was portrayed in the skit was not sanctioned by the airline and is not representative of the 27,000 professional flight attendants who take great care of millions of customers each year,” the carrier said. “We spoke to the customer who posted the video and shared our concerns that the actions depicted in the skit he witnessed are demeaning to our professional flight attendants and crew members throughout the industry. We appreciate that he listened to our concerns and that he agreed to remove the video. “
On The Forward Cabin, which has 22,500 followers, site creator Jamie Larounis posted twice Sunday afternoon. He said the Saturday night event “was not an American Airlines sanctioned event and was held on private property." However, he said, “The people in the skit were on the payroll of AA. They have an out of work group called Salute that performs at shows.”

The train of alternate uniforms in college football continues to roll across the nation and this time, its latest stop is in Starkville, Mississippi. The Mississippi State Bulldogs don't normally go into the deep waters of alternate uniforms, as they prefer to stick with simple recolors of what they consider as their normal uniforms. However, you have to imagine that it would take a truly special occasion for the program to switch their uniforms up in a major way and that has come in the form of honoring World War II veteran and Mississippi State alum G.V. Sonny Montgomery.
Mississippi State's latest alternate uniforms have been unveiled and like a big chunk of the alternate looks that you see nowadays, the uniforms themselves are gray. Just as black alternate uniforms had their time under the sun, it seems as if gray uniforms have become all the rage when it comes to alternate looks and in this case, Mississippi State and Adidas are no different and have fallen into that trend as well.
The main difference is that the uniforms themselves actually have an inspiration for being gray that is beyond just the idea of gray being a trendy color to wear. The difference here is that the uniforms are supposed to emulate a military plane that is named after Montgomery. The exterior of the plane itself is gray, so that means that the uniforms are going to follow suit.
The plane also includes the familiar Mississippi script insignia that is used on all sorts of official signage and documents in the state. The insignia made its way onto the helmet, which is easily the best part of this entire uniform. While the jersey and pants are relatively bare-bones and simple (which is intentional given that the font and numbering are supposed to emulate what you would see on a military aircraft), the Mississippi script insignia almost brings a sense of elegance and class to the helmet.

The helmet itself still feels a little cluttered due to all of the other elements that have been placed on it (even if the meaning behind those elements is honorable), but the script insignia is hard to ignore and it's what makes this helmet stand out from other alternate helmets. Personally, I place its quality at a notch below what we saw from Air Force when they unveiled their airplane-inspired alternate uniforms earlier this year. If Air Force's look was the gold standard, then Mississippi State's look would be the silver (or gray) standard.
Even though the uniform falls into the gray trend that is starting to get a little tired when it comes to sports uniforms and design, this is still a perfectly okay alternate uniform for Mississippi State. The helmets are definitely what you need to keep an eye on and it's definitely the element of the uniform that Bulldog fans and alumni should be the proudest of.

You can get a much better picture out of your TV by calibrating it. Professional calibration is a time-consuming and expensive process that requires special equipment and training, but you can tweak your TV to look better by spending only $30 on a test disc and taking half an hour to play with some settings. Our instructions will walk you through a very basic calibration process based on Imaging Science Foundation methods and require no experience on your part. All you have to do is order a Spears & Munsil HD 2.0 Benchmark and Calibration Disc and follow the seven steps below.
The Spears & Munsil disc is a very useful tool for consumers looking to calibrate their TVs or just understand more about how video signals work, and is recommended by ISF founder and president Joel Silver. It comes with extensive instructions both on the disc and in the included booklet, but many of them are unnecessary and can be simply disregarded unless you're a professional and familiar with TV calibration to begin with.
This is a standard Blu-ray disc, so it doesn't reach 4K resolution or offer calibration for HDR content. Spears & Munsil is putting the finishing touches on its Ultra HD Blu-ray calibration disc, which will support testing and calibration for 4K and HDR content. We'll take a look at that disc when it launches, and for now you can still tweak your TV to get better colors and contrast with the current disc.
1. Find the Best Picture Mode
You'll get the best results by starting in the correct picture mode. This is the general mode that dictates many of the television's individual picture settings, and often enables some of the higher level options for making calibration adjustments. Ideally, your television will have an ISF picture mode, which means it provides a complete suite of settings to perform a full calibration (you won't need to touch most of them; that's for professionals). Otherwise, look for any Cinema or Theater mode and start from there. If those aren't available, look for Custom. Stay away from any Vivid, Game, or Sports modes.
2. Use the Warmest Color Temperature Setting
Once you find a mode that seems right, look for the Color Temperature setting and make sure it's set to Warm. This works with the picture mode to produce, for most modern TVs, fairly accurate colors across the board. You can get pinpoint precision for color levels with a full white balance/RGBCMY calibration, but that requires a calibration professional with special equipment. For most consumers, the warmest color temperature preset will do the job.
3. Turn Off Unnecessary Picture Features
Your TV probably comes with several options designed to let it tweak the picture settings on the fly to ideally suit whatever you're looking at. They have their place, but they're the bane of calibration. You need to make sure the test patterns you're looking at are displayed with fixed settings and that the TV isn't adjusting them while you're working. In your TV's picture settings menu, look for any submenu that sounds like Advanced Picture, Expert Picture, or Picture Options. Disable any feature with the words Adaptive, Dynamic, Motion, Processing, or Smoothing. While you're there, make sure Overscan is turned off, if it's an option (this will help in the next step).
Incidentally, disabling any motion-enhancing features will reduce that jarring soap opera effect many users dislike. Motion enhancements have their place, often in live sports or video games, but most movies and TV shows are much more pleasant to watch with them turned off. Our guide to refresh rates offers a deeper explanation of just what these modes do and whether it matters that your TV is 60, 120, or 240Hz.
4. Check Picture Geometry
No matter how you adjust other settings, your TV will look best if it is set to display whatever you're watching in the right aspect ratio. This can be a problem for cable boxes if you're flipping between HD and SD channels, but otherwise you should be able to set everything up to display pictures at their native resolution. Look for a button on your remote or a setting in your Picture menu called Aspect Ratio, Picture Size, or Zoom. Make sure it's set to Normal or Just Scan. Don't select anything called Wide, Zoom, 3:4, or 16:9.
You can check that the picture geometry is correct with the Spears & Munsil disc. Under Advanced Video, select Setup and then Framing. A test pattern will appear that displays the boundaries of various resolutions. If your TV is 1080p, the white arrows pointing at the 1920 x 1080 lines will touch the edge of the screen. If you have an ultra high-definition (UHD, or 4K) TV, you can still use the 1080p lines to check your screen geometry; they're the same proportions, and most video sources still output at 1080p, so your TV needs to be able to handle that signal properly regardless.
5. Set Contrast
This is where the Spears & Munsil disc becomes useful. You're going to adjust the Brightness and Contrast settings using PLUGE test charts on the disc. In the main menu of the disc, select Video Calibration and then Contrast. Adjust the Contrast setting on your television until the numbered bars below 238 are distinct shades of gray, and the numbered bars above 238 are white. The gray boxes surrounding the ten colored squares on the top and bottom of the screen should be visible, and the gradient in the middle should ramp down smoothly from a white band in the center to black on the sides.
6. Set Brightness
It sounds counterintuitive, but the Brightness setting of your TV actually adjusts black level. Press right on your Blu-ray player's remote to go to the Brightness test pattern. Crank up the Brightness setting of your TV until all four gray bars in the middle are visible, then slowly turn the Brightness down until just the two right bars are visible and the two left bars have disappeared into the background.
7. Note Your Settings
If you followed these instructions, your TV should now be calibrated as well as it can be without professional equipment. Ignore the instructions on tweaking color or sharpness in the Video Calibration menu; the vast majority of TVs sold in the last few years have sorted out those settings as defaults that work pretty solidly, and trying to change them can lead to picture errors.
You can check your results by going into the Demonstration Materials menu and looking at some of the video clips. They should look full of detail in both light and shadow, with fine textures appearing distinct. Colors should look natural and not garish or tinted blue or pink.
Write down the Picture setting, Color Temperature setting, and any features you disabled, along with the Brightness and Contrast levels. If you make changes in the future, you can fix any problems that arise with the picture by resetting the TV to default settings and using your notes.

The young entrepreneurs making this year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list, are focusing on the region's huge but largely untapped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many of which need to digitalize their businesses to boost efficiencies.
The International Finance Corporation estimates there are 30 million SMEs in developing countries across Asia. These companies employ 62% of the region’s workforce and contribute an average of 42% to each Asian country's GDP, according to the Asian Development Bank. Despite their significant contributions to the economies around the region, there's inadequate government policy support for SMEs particularly in areas of financing and business services, the ADB said in a recent report. Some of this year's list honorees are at least providing services that SMEs can use to expand and automate their businesses.
In Singapore, Kenny Wang is tackling this gap by addressing the security concerns of SMEs. Igloohome, which Wang joined in 2015 as chief operations officer, makes smart locks that can be locked or unlocked remotely via an app. The startup has also developed an online software that can remotely secure facilities and grant access rights, potentially making the management of such facilities easier for small business owners. Now, it is working with over 60 vendors globally to distribute and install the smart locks. Igloohome has attracted more than $10 million in funding from investors including Singapore-based investors Insignia Ventures Partners and Temasek Holdings-backed Wavemaker Partners.
Helping SMEs is also the focus of several startups in China, where entrepreneurs are catering to various needs for better and more efficient online services. For example, Tungee, a Guangzhou-based startup cofounded in 2016 by Chen Kairan and Li Zhan, uses artificial intelligence and data analytics technologies to analyze sales results and customer preferences. Now backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, the startup has developed a B2B search engine, which it claims can allow sales people to find specific customer data more quickly.
Tungee’s local peer Zaihui has developed a similar technology to analyze customer preferences. But the Shanghai-based startup focuses on the online take-out market: It helps restaurant owners manage food-delivery orders, develop loyalty programs and come up with more tailored marketing campaigns. The need for such services is especially pronounced in the country, where as many as 9 million restaurants are competing for the attention of customers through meal ordering platforms like Meituan and Alibaba’s Ele.me. “The mobile internet trend has radically reshaped consumer behavior and preferences," Zaihui cofounder Zhao Yang says in our survey. "Most restaurant owners are merely specialized in cooking tasty food, but not in online customer interaction, marketing and content."
Mobility is another area that has seen the young entrepreneurs developing tailored services. In Pakistan, Roshni Rides is catering to the need for safer and more reliable transportation by providing rickshaw rides to female employees. The idea is a spinoff from the cofounders’ original project—Hanaa Lakhani, Hasan Usmani, Gia Farooqi and Moneeb Mian won in 2017 the $1 million Hult Prize for their idea of arranging affordable rickshaw rides along designated routes between a refugee camp and common destinations such as markets and hospitals. The four Pakistani Americans have since moved back to Karachi, where they are further building their ride-sharing business.
Meanwhile in Japan, Retsu Kitagawa’s SmartDrive is providing an automated fleet management service to business owners. Founded in 2013, the startup has already attracted $30 million in total funding. It installs a small telematics device in their customers' vehicles that's connected to SmartDrive's cloud-based fleet management platform dubbed DriveOps. The system allows companies to monitor driving routes and evaluate whether drivers are driving recklessly, potentially reducing accidents and saving companies from having to pay higher insurance fees.
Equally important to the success of SMEs is finding talent. In Vietnam, Kevin Tung Nguyen’s JobHop is using data analytics to provide tailored services. Its algorithm sorts through applicant profiles across Vietnamese recruitment sites to recommend the best candidates to potential employers, and the startup claims to have helped more than 500,000 jobseekers find jobs and 2,000 enterprises hire staff. “Existing web boards are full of spams and low quality CVs while head hunters are too expensive,” Nguyen says in our survey. Last year, JobHop attracted $710,000 in a seed funding round co-led by Singapore-based KK Fund and Japanese HR services firm Mynavi Corporation.

What's also particularly interesting about Samuel L. Jackson's Instagram post are where it's geotagged and the other pictures attached. The location is listed as Watford, United Kingdom, and Jackson also included snapshots of his Nick Fury goatee, eye scarring and eyepatch. Those latter photos indicate that Jackson is teasing the return of present day Nick Fury, thus taking Captain Marvel off the table (plus, that movie just wrapped principal photography). As far as we know, none of the Avengers 4 reshoots are happening in the United Kingdom, but a Marvel movie that is shooting across the pond is Spider-Man: Far From Home. Does this mean that Fury will appear in the Web-Slinger's next standalone adventure? It's too soon to tell, but since Nick Fury served as Spider-Man's mentor in the Ultimate universe, maybe this relationship will be adapted for Far From Home.

Patrick Stewart is boldly going back to where he’s gone before — just not in a very long time — when he reprises his role as “Star Trek: Next Generation” captain, Jean-Luc Picard in his upcoming CBS All Access series.
The series has now released a trailer and revealed which former “Star Trek” cast members are joining Stewart — who was last seen as Picard in the 2002 film “Star Trek: Nemesis” — when it presented at Comic-Con earlier this month.
With that in mind, TheWrap has rounded up everything that we know about CBS All Access’ second “Star Trek” series.

1. It will premiere later than expected.
We still don’t have a firm premiere date, but CBS All Access is now saying that “Star Trek: Picard” won’t debut until early next year. It was initially believed that the series would debut at the end of 2019, but that plan has apparently changed.
2. It will be the first “Star Trek” series to have a women direct its pilot or debut episode.
Hanelle Culpepper, who directed a pair of episodes for “Star Trek: Discovery,” will helm the first two episodes for the untitled series. Though many female directors have been behind the camera for “Star Trek” episodes over its decades-long history, she will be the first to direct a pilot or debut episode. All 13 “Star Trek” films have been directed by men.
3. He won’t be your father’s Jean-Luc Picard.
Viewers may have a hard time recognizing Patrick Stewart’s former U.S.S. Enterprise captain.
“It’s been 20-plus years, so he couldn’t possibly be that same person anymore,” said Alex Kurtzman, who is shepherding CBS All Access’s burgeoning “Star Trek” universe, during the Television Critics Association Press Tour in February.
“The question becomes: What has happened to him in that period of time? Have there been occurrences that force him to reckon with choices that he’s made in his life?” he continued. “How do you hold on to to being the person that everybody loved, when the circumstances around you may have changed so radically? Those are the big questions that we’re asking.”
Stewart had been reluctant to revisit the role of Picard over the years, but Kurtzman said he agreed to get on board only if he could do something radically different with the character. “Patrick was really clear with us from the beginning he did not want to repeat what had already been done.”

4. Picard, now an Admiral, left Starfleet behind.
Kurtzman wasn’t kidding when he said this version of Picard would be markedly different.
In a brief teaser, we learned that Picard is now Admiral Jean-Luc Picard… or at least he was. That’s because Picard has apparently hung up his Starfleet badge and retreated to his family’s vineyard. All we know from the teaser is that around 15 years prior to the start of the series, Picard, after leading the “greatest rescue armada in history” had something “unimaginable” happen.
We figure the series is going to delve into just what that was, and why it was bad enough that would make Picard leave Starfleet.
5. He won’t be away from Starfleet for much longer.
In the full-length trailer showed at Comic-Con, Stewart is living out his days on the Picard family vineyard, but his retirement is disrupted after he crosses paths with a young women (Isa Briones) who he thinks is in danger. This appears to be the jumping off point for the series, because he’s quickly back aboard a Starfleet ship with a new crew that includes new cast-mates Alison Pill and Santiago Cabrera.
6. He’ll be joined by more “Star Trek” alums, including Data (who died at the end of “Nemesis”).
Stewart will not be the only “Star Trek” actor reprising his role on the CBS All Access series. The android Data, who “died” at the end of 2002’s “Nemesis” appears to be alive and well, and will be joined by his former “Next Generation” crew including Commander Ryker (Jonathan Frakes) and Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis).

7. The Borg are back.
That’s right. The alien race that has tormented Picard throughout “Next Generation” and the films is back, though in what capacity is unclear. Jeri Ryan is reprising her role as Seven of Nine from “Star Trek Voyager,” and Jonathan Del Arco will return as Hugh the Borg. The trailer also showed a brief glimpse at their spaceship, The Borg Cube.
8. It will include a tie-in to the most recent “Star Trek” film series.
The one plot detail that Kurtzman would actually confirm will be a tie-in to J.J. Abrams’ 2009 reboot of the franchise “Star Trek.”
Picard’s storyline will incorporate the destruction of Romulus — the Romulans were a primary antagonist for Picard and the “Next Generation” crew — and whatever happened appeared to be so bad that it led Picard to leave Starfleet behind.
Romulus’ destruction will be familiar to those who’ve seen the three rebooted “Star Trek” films that JJ Abrams kicked off (Justin Lin helmed the third film, “Star Trek Beyond”).
In 2009’s “Star Trek,” the Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) blames Spock (Leonard Nimoy) — now an ambassador — for the destruction of his home planet, which was destroyed by a supernova. This supernova sucks in both Nero and Spock, flinging them back in time by 150 years, and bringing Nero face-to-face with the U.S.S. Kelvin. This is important because George Kirk, the father of legendary captain James T. Kirk, is aboard this ship and ends up sacrificing himself to save his wife and newborn son.
That event creates an alternate timeline — dubbed “The Kelvin Timeline” — that the rebooted franchise, which includes “Star Trek: Into Darkness” and “Star Trek: Beyond,” exists in.
9. It will be the second-furthest in the future that any “Star Trek” property has explored (thanks “Discovery!”).“Star Trek: Picard” will pick up sometime around the turn of the 25th century (2399), which represents the second-furthest any “Star Trek” property has explored. It was going to be the furthest, until “Star Trek: Discovery” blasted its crew some 950 years into the future, which places it sometime int he 32nd century.
Even so, Kurtzman said “Picard” will not get carried away with too much futurism. “No matter what choices we’re making about portraying the future, it has to feel grounded,” he continued. “The easy thing to do is come up with crazy floating skyscrapers and the clichés of science fiction. We’ve tried to avoid that across the board.”
10. It’s called “Star Trek: Picard.”
This followed months of informally calling it that.

Apex Legends is a hit. That much, so far, is undeniable. The combination of a surprise launch during a low period in the calendar and an aggressive paid influencer campaign worked out: the game is sticky enough and addictive enough to get people playing long after they came around just to see what the fuss was about. The game has had 10 million players in 72 hours, with 1 million peak concurrents--all this means so far is that it has had a successful launch, but I'm hopeful that there's enough depth here to parlay the launch into the future. For Respawn and EA, this is good news. The only problem is that a free-to-play game doesn't make money just by being excellent.
So far it's easy to play Apex Legends without spending any money, and the game doesn't particularly compel you to do so. It's the curse of a fun, balanced free-to-play game: it stands well enough on its own that it doesn't necessarily demand that you alter your experience in any way. A game like Apex Legends makes its money through must-have skins and cosmetics: the sort of thing that takes an already cool character in such a different direction that it feels like it can alter what its like to play the game on its own, even though it's just flair. And so far, I just don't see those skins in this game. I sort of like Bloodhound's Japanese skins and Gibraltar has some nice pieces, but a lot of the characters don't have anything that exceeds the complexity of an Epic-tier skin in Overwatch.
Take, for example, this Bloodhound skin below. It's one the better concept skins, actually: a plague doctor is a tried-and-true creepy skin for any number of games, and it's a good fit for the character. And yet the execution here basically begins and ends with the helmet--below the neck isn't a whole lot more than generic body armor. Where are my weird vials, my bloodstained leather apron, my creepy religious insignia? It's a good start, but it needs more before it's going to drive a purchase.

By contrast, check out this plague doctor from Fortnite. It just feels like has more follow-through:

Apex Legends is already on the back foot here as a first-person game where you can't see your skin during gameplay. Clearly, Overwatch has proven that you can still get people to buy skins under these circumstances, but Blizzard has done so with years of excellent character design that has people eagerly clicking through teasers to see new event skins. I don't see that kind of spark here yet, which is hard because Apex Legends is a battle royale game and thus goes up against Fortnite. Not only does Fortnite have some of the best and most expansive free-to-play characters in the business, it has the advantage of being in third-person.
Call of Duty's Blackout Mode had a similar problem, with one major difference: Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 was a $60 box, and so Activision had already made its money off of anyone playing. This isn't the case with the free-to-play Apex Legends. It's the tricky business of being a free-to-play game with cosmetic-driven revenue: the developers have to make a game that people want to play, or there won't be anyone to spend money on cosmetics. But it's ultimately down to the artists to make compelling skins that drive people to actually click that buy button: they're the last step in the monetization process, and it just doesn't work without them.
The next big step in Apex Legends' long-term financial viability will be the introduction of a battle pass, which remains a great way to transform free-to-play players into paid ones, and a great way to build out a free-to-play community that isn't dependent on whales. But even if there's a little more leeway there, a battle pass still needs the sort of great cosmetics that push a player towards a sale, and I'm just not seeing that sort of thing in the game yet.
It's not a disaster by any means, yet. Fortnite's early skins look like paper dolls compared to what Epic is putting out now. But now that the game is clearly solid, Respawn needs to redouble its efforts to get some unique, interesting character and weapon skins that will drive the revenue it needs to follow its userbase.

The bigger they are, the harder they fall. If you decided to go large with the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, then you need to get a case on there to protect it. The largest iPhone in the pack is slippery and unwieldy and all too easy to drop. Keep the glass back and that enormous screen safe and pristine with one of the best iPhone 11 Pro Max cases. We’ve got a range of solid options for you right here.
Razer Arctech Pro Case
Overheating can be a problem, especially when you’re putting the iPhone 11 Pro Max to the test with a marathon gaming session. Razer wants to help with the Arctech Pro case, which has a special thermaphene layer designed to collect heat and dissipate it out through the perforations in the back. Thankfully, you don’t have to sacrifice protection to keep cool, because you’ll also find a microfiber layer inside to prevent any scratches and the Pro case boasts drop protection up to 10 feet.
Noreve Tradition B Wallet Case
This beautifully stylish, leather wallet case brings some French flair to your iPhone. A sturdy shell grips your iPhone and a luxurious leather cover wraps around it, with a stud closure to ensure it stays shut when you want it to. The inside cover hosts two pockets for cards with the option of adding two more rear slots. Noreve offers a range of customizations to enable you to select the precise leather finish and color you want and choose various extras, though this will impact the price.
Nomad Rugged Brown Case
By wrapping polycarbonate in Horween leather which slots neatly into a TPE bumper Nomad has managed to create a rugged case that delivers 6-foot drop protection, but also looks and feels great. The leather will age and develop its own patina over time while the case ensures your iPhone stays in great condition. There’s a pronounced lip to protect the screen, accurate cutouts for easy access, button covers, and it won’t interfere with wireless charging. It’s also available in black.
Incipio Aerolite Case
As Incipio’s most protective case, the Aerolite offers protection from falls of up to 11 feet and it manages to do so without adding a lot of bulk thanks to a special material called FortiCore. There are contours inside the case and reinforced, shock-absorbing corners to take the sting out of drops. You can also get a glimpse of the iPhone within this case, and it comes in three different color combinations.
Case-Mate Twinkle Case
Packed with reflective iridescent glitter foil, this case twinkles in the light like stardust. Beyond the sparkly exterior, there’s a tough case here that offers up to 10-foot drop protection for your iPhone. The flexible sides enhance grip and there are metallic button covers and accurate cutouts. The back also boasts a special anti-scratch coating.
Griffin Survivor Strong Case
If you want to be able to see the design of your iPhone 11 Pro Max, but need some drop protection, then the Griffin Survivor Strong could be for you. There’s a clear polycarbonate back with scratch resistance and a special FortiCore-reinforced bumper that provides grip and protection from falls of up to 10 feet. Griffin does offer a bunch of much tougher and more expensive cases if that’s what you’re after, but this is a good compromise. It also comes in translucent black or green.
Smartish Kung-Fu Grip Case
The iPhone 11 Pro Max is a very big phone, so you may be keen to avoid adding any extra bulk with a case. The Kung-Fu Grip case from Smartish is slim and very light with air pockets to provide some protection against drop damage. The sides are textured to enhance your grip and you’ll find generous cutouts and well-defined button covers. The case also extends at the front to safeguard that enormous screen. This case comes in five different colors.
Skech Stark Case
This clever design manages to offer rugged drop protection for falls of up to 10 feet, but in a minimal form that leaves the iPhone on display and the sides fully accessible. The screen and camera are still protected thanks to raised edges and that hard, clear back is scratch-resistant. The top and bottom edges are where the shockproof protection is. The clear version seems to make the most sense if you’re a minimalist, but this case also comes in four different colors.
VRS Damda High Pro Shield Case
While this case is a standard mix of polycarbonate and TPU it sports an unusual sandstone texture that enhances grip and prevents fingerprints or smudges from accumulating. There are button covers and openings for access to all features, it doesn’t interfere with wireless charging and raised edges protect the camera and screen. As for drop damage, VRS suggests it’s fine for falls of up to 4 feet, which covers you for a typical drop from pocket height.
Mous Contour Case
The new Contour range from Mous hits the sweet spot between style and substance, offering solid drop protection in an attractive package. The curved plastic case has microfiber inside to keep that glass scratch-free and the back is covered in different colors of leather or a textured speckle finish. There are chunky button covers and all the openings you need are present and correct.

Nintendo's Switch has been a runaway success that came just in the nick of time. The hybrid portable and home console has struck a chord with lapsed gamers who don't have enough spare time to sit in front of a TV for hours at a time, along with those who had migrated to playing games on their smartphone.
As someone who's had a Nintendo Switch since the day it launched in March of 2017, I can personally attest to its ability to reinvigorate a long-dormant love of games.
But despite its popularity, the Switch isn't perfect: its battery only lasts between three and five hours when you're on-the-go, its screen can get scratched in your bag, it only has a limited amount of built-in storage, and Nintendo's first-party dock (which is what allows the Switch to connect to a TV) costs nearly $100.
The 10 accessories below can solve all of these problems (and more) without you having to spend more than $50. In many cases, you'll spend less than $30. With a few of these accessories you can keep your Switch protected, fully charged, and ready to hold a massive library of great games without breaking the bank.

March 18 marks the fifth anniversary of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, which capped the most blatant land grab in Europe since World War II. While the simmering conflict in Donbas now dominates the headlines, it is possible to see a path to resolution there. It is much more difficult with Crimea, which will remain a problem between Kyiv and Moscow, and between the West and Russia, for years—if not decades—to come.
The Taking of Crimea
In late February 2014, just days after the end of the Maidan Revolution and Victor Yanukovych’s flight from Kyiv, “little green men”—a term coined by Ukrainians—began seizing key facilities on the Crimean peninsula. The little green men were clearly professional soldiers by their bearing, carried Russian weapons, and wore Russian combat fatigues, but they had no identifying insignia. Vladimir Putin originally denied they were Russian soldiers; that April, he confirmed they were.
By early March, the Russian military had control of Crimea. Crimean authorities then proposed a referendum, which was held on March 16. It proved an illegitimate sham. To begin with, the referendum was illegal under Ukrainian law. Moreover, it offered voters two choices: to join Russia, or to restore Crimea’s 1992 constitution, which would have entailed significantly greater autonomy from Kyiv. Those on the peninsula who favored Crimea remaining a part of Ukraine under the current constitutional arrangements found no box to check.
The referendum unsurprisingly produced a Soviet-style result: 97 percent allegedly voted to join Russia with a turnout of 83 percent. A true referendum, fairly conducted, might have shown a significant number of Crimean voters in favor of joining Russia. Some 60 percent were ethnic Russians, and many might have concluded their economic situation would be better as a part Russia.
It was not, however, a fair referendum. It was conducted in polling places under armed guard, with no credible international observers, and with Russian journalists reporting that they had been allowed to vote. Two months later, a member of Putin’s Human Rights Council let slip that turnout had been more like 30 percent, with only half voting to join Russia.
Regardless, Moscow wasted no time. Crimean and Russian officials signed a “treaty of accession” just two days later, on March 18. Spurred by a fiery Putin speech, ratification by Russia’s rubberstamp Federation Assembly and Federation Council was finished by March 21.
Attempts to Justify
Moscow’s actions violated the agreement among the post-Soviet states in 1991 to accept the then-existing republic borders. Those actions also violated commitments to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence that Russia made in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances for Ukraine and 1997 Ukrainian-Russian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership.
In late March 2014, Russia had to use its veto to block a U.N. Security Council resolution that, among other things, expressed support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity (there were 13 yes votes and one abstention). The Russians could not, however, veto a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly. It passed 100-11, affirming Ukraine’s territorial integrity and terming the Crimean referendum invalid.
Russian officials sought to justify the referendum as an act of self-determination. It was not an easy argument for the Kremlin to make, given the history of the two bloody wars that Russia waged in the 1990s and early 2000s to prevent Chechnya from exercising a right of self-determination.
Russian officials also cited Western recognition of Kosovo as justification. But that did not provide a particularly good model. Serbia subjected hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians to ethnic-cleansing in 1999; by contrast, no ethnic-cleansing occurred in Crimea. Kosovo negotiated with Serbia to reach an amicable separation for years before declaring independence unilaterally. There were no negotiations with Kyiv over Crimea’s fate, and it took less than a month from the appearance of the little green men to Crimea’s annexation.

The Crimea issue isn’t going anywhere
The military seizure of Crimea provoked a storm of criticism. The United States and European Union applied visa and financial sanctions, as well as prohibited their ships and aircraft from traveling to Crimea without Ukrainian permission. Those sanctions were minor, however, compared to those applied on Russia after it launched a proxy conflict in Donbas in April 2014, and particularly after a Russian-provided surface-to-air missile downed a Malaysian Air airliner carrying some 300 passengers.
Whereas Ukrainian forces on Crimea did not resist the Russian invasion (in part at the urging of the West), Kyiv resisted the appearance of little green men in Donbas. Before long, the Ukrainians found themselves fighting Russian troops as well as “separatist” forces. That conflict is now about to enter its sixth year.
Finding a settlement in Donbas has taken higher priority over resolving the status of Crimea—understandable given that some 13,000 have died and two million been displaced in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Moscow seems to see the simmering conflict as a useful means to pressure and distract Kyiv, both to make instituting domestic reform more difficult and to hinder the deepening of ties between Ukraine and Europe.
Resolving the Donbas conflict will not prove easy. For example, the Kremlin may not be prepared to settle until it has some idea of where Ukraine fits in the broader European order, that is, its relationship with the European Union and NATO. But Russia has expressed no interest in annexing Donbas. While the seizure of Crimea proved very popular with the broader Russia public, the quagmire in Donbas has not. The most biting Western economic sanctions would come off of Russia if it left Donbas. At some point, the Kremlin may calculate that the costs outweigh the benefits and consent to a settlement that would allow restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty there.
Moscow will not, on the other hand, willingly give up Crimea. Russians assert a historical claim to the peninsula; Catherine the Great annexed the peninsula in 1783 following a war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. (That said, Crimea was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954, and, as noted above, the republics that emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union in 1991 agreed to accept the borders as then drawn.)
Retaining Crimea is especially important to Putin, who can offer the Russian people no real prospect of anything other than a stagnant economy and thus plays the nationalism and Russia-as-a-great-power cards. He gained a significant boost in public popularity (much of which has now dissipated) from the rapid and relatively bloodless takeover of the peninsula. Moreover, it offers a vehicle for Russia to maintain a festering border dispute with Ukraine, which the Kremlin may see as discouraging NATO members from getting too close to Ukraine.
Kyiv at present lacks the political, economic, and military leverage to force a return. Perhaps the most plausible route would require that Ukraine get its economic act together, dramatically rein in corruption, draw in large amounts of foreign investment, and realize its full economic potential, and then let the people in Crimea—who have seen no dramatic economic boom after becoming part of Russia—conclude that their economic lot would be better off back as a part of Ukraine.
For the West, Russia’s seizure and annexation of Crimea pose a fundamental challenge to the European order and the norms established by the 1975 Helsinki Final Act. The United States and Europe should continue their policy of non-recognition of Crimea’s illegal incorporation. They should also maintain Crimea-related sanctions on Russia, if for no other reason than to signal that such land grabs have no place in 21st-century Europe.

DBS Bank is launching the world's first metal Visa payWave card as an update to its DBS Insignia Visa Infinite Card.
It is the only metal card to have a Visa payWave function, said Ooi Huey Tyng, Visa country manager for Singapore and Brunei.
Members of the card - which is available only by invitation - must have an annual income of at least S$500,000.
There is also a yearly fee of S$3,000 for brandishing the DBS Insignia Visa Infinite Card.
Ms Ooi said at a press briefing on Thursday: "The introduction of the world's first Visa payWave metal card - DBS Insignia - is aligned with the needs of the affluent consumer today who are embracing a cashless lifestyle.
"At Visa, one-third of our affluent cardholders are heavy contactless users, and we are seeing close to 90 per cent year on year growth on Visa payWave affluent users."
According to DBS, the affluent segment - those with a minimum annual income of S$150,000 - is growing at 25 per cent year on year and more are embracing cashless payment methods, with 40 per cent of all face-to-face transactions made in Singapore contactless.
It also said 55 per cent of the affluent segment are active on Visa payWave, with 70 per cent of them using multiple digital channels such as Apple, Samsung, and Android Pay.
Most of the expenditures made by the affluent using the cards are on travel services, such as flights and travel agencies, according to Visa.
For instance, 90 per cent of DBS rewards redemption by DBS Insignia cardmembers are for air miles.
The new DBS Insignia card offers 100,000 air miles for new cardmembers, and are accorded Priority Pass membership. Cardholders also earn two miles for every S$1 spent overseas, and 1.6 miles for every S$1 spent locally.

American Express announced Tuesday that its prepaid debit cards will now be backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the latest indication that a market once shunned by established financial institutions is gaining ground.
The use of reloadable prepaid cards has exploded in the wake of the credit crisis that left millions of Americans outside the traditional banking system. But reloadable prepaid cards do not offer the same financial protections for consumers as checking accounts. They also operate with fewer regulatory constraints.
Facing increasing scrutiny from consumer advocates, the vast majority of card operators have opted in the past few years to carry up to $250,000 in mandatory deposit insurance per customer offered through the FDIC. American Express is one of the last major providers to sign on to that government backstop.
The coverage will apply to Bluebird cards sold at Wal-Mart stores. The card carries the American Express insignia and operates much like a debit or credit card, with features such as roadside assistance and mobile banking. Customers also can write checks with the account and load up to $100,000 a year.
“This product is really designed to be an alternative to traditional banking,” said Dan Schulman, group president of enterprise growth at American Express. “Technology is beginning to blur the distinction between those lines.”
This move could expand American Express’s customer base. Bluebird customers will now be able to have government payments, such as Social Security, military pay and tax refunds, deposited directly onto their cards. Government funds can be deposited only into federally insured accounts.
Demand for the cards exploded as nearly 1 million households exited the banking system between 2009 and 2011. The industry is expected to reach nearly $202 billion in revenue this year, compared with $28.6 billion in 2009, according to consulting firm Mercator Advisory Group.
In the six months since Bluebird debuted, more than 575,000 customers have signed up, placing more than $275 million into their accounts. Many of these customers either had no desire for a traditional credit or debit card or could not apply for such products because of their poor credit histories, Schulman said.
But consumer advocates have warned that prepaid card operators are not always forthcoming about their fees, including charges to load money, activate the card, speak to customer service or check a balance at an automated teller machine. They worry that card operators are steering lower-income consumers into these products without fully disclosing the terms.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to issue rules this year to address some of the consumer advocates’ concerns, including fee disclosure policies. Adam Rust, research director of Reinvestment Partners, a consumer advocacy group, applauded American Express for insuring Bluebird accounts without being prodded by regulators, a sign, he said, that the industry is evolving and responding to consumer demands.
“If used correctly, prepaid cards can be far more cost effective than a regular checking account, particularly if you are someone who doesn’t have the money to set aside for a minimum monthly balance,” Rust said.
But Susan Weinstock of Pew Charitable Trusts is concerned that the FDIC insurance is not being extended to all American Express prepaid products, including a similar prepaid card offered through Target.
“Does it set a precedent that allows other companies to get into this space and avoid FDIC insurance?” Weinstock said. “Should those companies go under, the big question is what will happen to consumers and their money?”
American Express officials said the company is considering deposit insurance for its entire suite of prepaid cards.

En medio del escándalo por las acusaciones contra su protagonista, comenzó el rodaje de la última entrega de capítulos de la exitosa serie
Comentar Me gusta Me gusta Compartir E-mail Twitter Facebook WhatsApp Guardar 30 de octubre de 2017 • 16:55
House of Cards, serie insignia de Netflix , llegará a su fin en la próxima temporada, la número seis, prevista para 2018, tal como confirmaron Variety y The Hollywood Reporter.
La confirmación del final de la serie llega un día después de que la estrella del programa, Kevin Spacey , fuera acusado de abuso sexual de un menor: el actor de Star Trek, Anthony Rapp , declaró en una entrevista con el sitio BuzzFeed, que el protagonista de House of Cards abusó de él tras una fiesta en su departamento en 1986. Rapp tenía 14 años, Spacey, 26.
Dada la enorme repercusión que tuvo esta noticia en el mundo, la compañía de entretenimiento vía streaming decidió emitir un comunicado en el que reitera las palabras de Beau Willimon, creador de la serie, sobre las acusaciones contra Spacey [Willimon dijo que la denuncia era "profundamente preocupante"]: "Media Rights Capital y Netflix están profundamente preocupados por las noticias de anoche sobre Kevin Spacey". "En respuesta a las revelaciones, los ejecutivos de ambas compañías viajarona Baltimore esta tarde para reunirse con nuestro equipo y elenco y asegurar que ellos continúan seguros y cuentan con nuestro apoyo. Tal como estaba programado con anterioridad, Kevin Spacey no está trabajando en el set en este momento", explica el mensaje enviado a The Hollywood Reporter.
Horas después de que se publicaran las declaraciones de Rapp, Kevin Spacey pidió disculpas en un comunicado y dijo no recordar el episodio. En el mismo mensaje decidió hablar por primera vez de su sexualidad y se declaró homosexual. El texto, publicado en sus redes sociales, provocó el repudio de la comunidad LGTB por haber intentado desviar la atención de la acusación de abuso de un menor revelando su homosexualidad y, aún más grave, por haber asociado su elección sexual con un caso de pedofilia. Zachary Quinto, de Star Trek, fue uno de los que expresaron su preocupación por el mensaje de Spacey con un duro comunicado: "Es profundamente triste y complicado el modo en que Kevin Spacey decidió salir del closet, no desde el lugar del orgullo -bajo la luz de sus muchos premios y logros- y tratando de inspirar a decenas de miles de chicos que lidian con cuestiones referidas al colectivo LGBT alrededor del mundo, sino con una calculada manipulación para distraer la atención de una muy seria acusación de quien él intentó molestar. Siento mucho pesar por la experiencia de Anthony Rapp y subsiguiente sufrimiento. Y me da pena que Kevin haya buscando dar a conocer su verdad de modo que le sirva, del mismo modo en que negarlo le sirvió durante tantos años. Ojalá sea la voz de Anthony Rapp la única que se haga oír aquí. Las voces de las víctimas son las únicas que merecen ser escuchadas"
Además de ser el protagonista y figura fundamental de la serie en su rol de Frank Underwood, Spacey es uno de los productores de House of Cards. Desde su estreno en 2013, la ficción fue nominada a 53 premios Emmy, incluyendo cinco nominaciones a la mejor serie dramática.
El rodaje de la sexta temporada comenzó este mes en Maryland. Todavía no se confirmó la fecha de estreno pero se espera que será en el primer semestre de 2018.

2017 Upper Deck Goodwin Champions Checklist Heads to Oz, Outer Space and Beyond Share:

2017 Upper Deck Goodwin Champions knows no bounds. In addition to a variety of sports, big and small, various aspects in the product travel the world, explore space and even the wonderful world of Oz.
Just like the themes it covers, the types of cards in 2017 Upper Deck Goodwin Champions are just as eclectic. Proof of that can be found in the hobby box hits. Each has three total from a list that includes autographs, memorabilia cards, art cards, relics, 3D cards and embroidered patch cards.
Base Set
The 2017 Upper Deck Goodwin Champions base set features 150 cards. The first 100 are regular cards covering athletes from many sports. While many will be household names with sports fans, traditionally some come from fringe sports as well.
The final 50 cards are Black and White short prints.
Parallels are done in a variety of minis. Basic Mini cards land every four hobby packs. Numbered minis include Canvas (/99), Cloth Lady Luck (/25), Black Metal Magician (/17), Wood Lumberjack (/8) and Gold Presidential (1/1).
Autographs
Like the base set, autographs come from a wide range of athletes. Of the signed cards, Goodwin Autographs are the most common at 1:67 packs. These have Black and White (1:1,440) and hand-numbered Inscription versions to go with the regular ones.
Goudey Autographs are 1:640 hobby packs while Goudey Sport Royalty Autographs are 1:3,200.
Museum Collection World War II Signatures (1:244) honor veterans from the war.
One-of-one Goodwin Cut Signatures are also randomly inserted.
Memorabilia Cards
Goodwin Memorabilia (1:36) are the banner in which a lot of the gear cards fall. Besides the regular versions there are Dual Swatch (1:240) and Black and White (1:375) cards. Each of these have numbered Premium Series versions with upscale swatches.
The Goudey name has a few relic levels, too. These include Goudey Memorabilia (1:150), Goudey Sport Royalty Memorabilia (1:1,600) and Goudey Sport Royalty Memorabilia Dual Swatch (1:3,200). These each have numbered Premium parallels as well.
Relic Cards
Relic cards take 2017 Upper Deck Goodwin Champions in some of its wildest directions.
For starters, there’s a new batch of manufactured patch cards. Canine Companions delve into various breeds. A standard for the brand for years, patch cards have a tiered structure that make for a major set-building challenge. Canine Companions has five levels: Sporting (1:90), Working (1:271), Hearding (1:451), Hounds (1:752) and Toy (1:1,353).
After delving into Alice in Wonderland in the 2016 set, this time The Wonderful World of Oz is featured in a couple of premium inserts. Goodwin Masterpieces are hand-painted booklet cards. The full set has 21 different cards, each limited to ten copies. Like sketch cards, the art is done directly on each card. Only these aren’t sketches. They’re full-on paintings created for the trading card medium.
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Illustration Relics take early copies of the classic novel and embed pages into the cards. They’re like jersey cards but for books. A first edition copy of the book is one of those being used to create these relics.
Museum Collection Relics come with World War II memorabilia embedded in them. Basic Museum Collection Relics land 1:240 hobby packs while Jumbo Relics are 1:974. Booklet versions come with the form of Global Impact (1:974) and Legacy (1:3,247).
Ancient Currency Relics come with really old coin cards in them. Pieces come from authentic pirate treasure, Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire.
It’s safe to say that 2017 Upper Deck Goodwin Champions is all over the map. World Traveler Map relics (1:53) highlight different parts of world with a piece of a map embedded in them.
Vintage map relic cards from various National Parks are also included in the product: Yosemite (/90), Yellowstone (/72), Smoky Mountains (/34) and Rocky Mountains (/15).
Inserts
The Goudey name isn’t limited to autographs and memorabilia cards. It’s also included on a trio of regular inserts: Goudey (1:8), Goudey Animals (1:13) and Goudey PResidents (1:22).
3D Wonders of the Universe (1:32) are done in lenticular and go into deep space. Using artwork, cards include scientific looks at the galaxy and imaginings that go beyond. A total of 42 cards make up the premium insert set.

What We Do For Fun

Story 127
AS A BOY visiting his family in the early 1980s, Tommaso Fantoni would dash through the garden of the villa completed in 1945 by his grandfather, the designer and architect Osvaldo Borsani. Along with his older brother, Giacomo, he raced bicycles on the stone paths behind the 30-foot-high ivy-covered wall shielding the estate from a main street of Varedo, a 20-minute drive north of Milan. They swam in the small pool by the austere stucco-and-brick manor, with its flat tile roof and 13-foot-tall living-room windows, through which slashes of light fell onto geometric parquet floors as well as the angular modern furnishings that their grandfather had designed and a towering ceramic fireplace sculpted by Osvaldo’s friend, the artist Lucio Fontana.
The paterfamilias himself was rarely there to witness his grandsons play; though he was in his 70s by then, nearing the end of a half-century career, he still worked full time, conceptualizing new pieces and determining how to fabricate them. “What I remember most from those years,” says Tommaso, 45, who now has a Milan-based architecture practice (his brother is a corporate executive), “was his voice as he came through the door: low and deep and calm.”
Osvaldo, who died in 1985, was an understated yet monumental figure in the world of Italian Modernism, less well-known than his peer, the architect Gio Ponti, but perhaps as culturally significant. As part of the Rationalist movement of the 1930s — an unadorned alternative to the traditional classicism of Novecento Italian design, which also flourished in the prewar years — he was equally interested in the mechanics of mass producing his furniture and objects as he was in creating one-off designs, which set him apart from his purely artisanal contemporaries. He operated from Varedo only because that was where his father, Gaetano, had a custom woodworking atelier (Gaetano had acquired the land next door so that Osvaldo could build Villa Borsani for the family). Starting in the late 1940s, Osvaldo designed homes with Art Deco and Modernist touches for some of Italy’s emerging industrialists, including the wool magnate Ermenegildo Zegna, but as the years passed, he was drawn to more forward-looking silhouettes. He torqued the polished-wood minimalism of the midcentury by designing chairs and sofas in materials such as black-enameled steel and rubber. He also pioneered so-called adjustable furniture, including the P32 armchair, from 1956, which swivels on visible metallic mechanisms and returns automatically to its original position.

These and many other fascinating insights are from CB Insight’s Amazon Strategy Teardown: Amazon’s Barreling Into Physical Retail, Financial Services, Healthcare, And AI-Led Computing (PDF, 64 pp., opt-in). This report is an excellent read and provides insights into how and where Amazon is finding their greatest growth opportunities. CB Insight’s report also shows that Amazon’s approach to acquisitions is completely different than many other tech companies, especially those competing in enterprise software.
Amazon’s largest acquisitions include Whole Foods for $13.7B in 2017, online shoe retailer Zappos for $1.2B in 2009, and smart doorbell & security camera manufacturer Ring for approximately $1B earlier this year. In 2014 Amazon acquired e-sports streaming site Twitch for $970M, and warehouse robotics maker Kiva Systems for $775M in 2012. As of today, Amazon has more than 45,000 robots in its warehouses. The following graphic from the CB Insights report illustrates a more aggressive M&A strategy that has been the case in the past:
Unlike software companies’ merger & acquisition strategies being focused on building product portfolios or buying customers, Amazon is on the hunt for underserved market areas with high transaction volumes and undifferentiated channels that deliver margin growth. Many enterprise software acquisitions are consolidation-driven while Amazon’s are focused on building and extending new business models. Taking this business model-based approach to evaluating Amazon’s potential acquisitions, the following companies deserve to be on their shopping list for 2018.
Who Needs To Be On Amazon’s Shopping List In 2018 And Why
Expanding outside of traditional retail and consumer markets is where Amazon will find the greatest opportunities for rapid growth in the next several years. Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services, and Marketplace is the framework acquisitions are being evaluated against today. Expect to see Amazon add to this framework, as Jeff Bezos has alluded to the company’s plans to expand beyond these three core businesses in recent interviews.
Look for Amazon to make an acquisition in medical supply chains and industrial MRO in the next few years as companies in these industries are developing deep expertise in API and cloud integration, which is a perfect fit for fueling Amazon Web Services (AWS) future business growth.
Here are who needs to be on Amazon’s Shopping List for 2018:
Best Buy – Earlier this week Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) announced an exclusive multi-year partnership that covers the launch of more than ten 4K and HD Fire TV Edition models from Insignia and Toshiba, beginning this summer. 60% of the products sold by Amazon are electronics; please see the graphic below for specifics. Best Buy’s buyer demographics are perfectly aligned with Amazon Prime customers’ income levels. The partnership announced this week looks like a beta test of a much broader strategy aimed at removing the biggest roadblocks to generating more electronics product revenue. First, acquiring Best Buy gives Amazon an immediate way to capture 100% of every sale that begins with showrooming, or where customers browse items in a store and then buy them online. Second, combining online and in-store promotions to launch new high-end electronics products will increase transaction velocity and open up lucrative opportunities for upselling, and cross-selling customers while they are still in the store. Third, Amazon’s proven ability to drive down vendor prices will have an immediate positive effect on Best Buy’s gross margins and profitability.

What’s in your (waiter’s) wallet?
Visitors to the US are often mystified about the “right” amount to tip for service, and it turns out Americans don’t agree too much either.
An analysis of tens of millions of transactions across the US by payment service Square revealed that, when customers left a tip, Alaska (17%), Arkansas (16.9%), and North Carolina (16.8%) registered the three highest average tips for any US state. Delaware (14%), Hawaii (15.1%), and South Dakota (15.3%) registered the three lowest.
The highest average tip for any individual city was Denver, Colorado, at 16.8%, followed by Chicago (16.7%), Tampa (16.4%), Atlanta (16.3%), and Austin (16.2%). The nationwide average, according to Square’s data, is roughly 16.1%.
It’s worth noting that Square’s data aren’t perfect. The tips it logs are paid out not in cash, but using credit cards, which likely tempt customers into doling out a bit more cash than they would otherwise. Studies have shown that as little as a credit card insignia can lead to heftier tips (pdf). In fact, technology in general, justified or not, has been blamed for encouraging “guilt tipping.”
But Square serves a number of business types in each state, including restaurants, cafes, taxi services, and small vendors—meaning that its tipping wings spread across all sorts of tipping lands. The average transaction size per state also doesn’t deviate much. And the distribution of businesses in each state is fairly similar.
Square’s data is in fact fairly in line with perceived nationwide tipping trends. ”Those numbers are pretty consistent with what we’ve found,” Michael McCall, a professor at Ithaca college who specializes in consumer behavior, told Quartz. “The average tip was once about 15%, but it’s creeping up towards 20%.”
A bigger surprise, in fact, is Square’s data on the percentage of customers who tip at all. This varies from Illinois, where people left a little extra over 61% of the time, to Delaware, where fewer than 38% of transactions added a tip. (McCall had no light to shed on why the variance is so big.)
​
While it’s tempting to look for trends that might explain the variation, it would be hasty to establish any definite links, according to McCall. “There are certain cultural norms that develop across the country in terms of tipping,” he said. “If you’re traveling through and not coming back, there’s probably less incentive to tip well.” States like Delaware, for instance, that sit along major thoroughfares, likely deal with more transient customers. “But I’m not sure, for example, how much something like politics has to do with it,” McCall added. According to his research, a sense of empathy and culture of hospitality are harder to define, but would likely serve as better indicators.
So have a look at how each US state tips, but be easy on drawing any conclusions.

Over recent seasons, the military service academy schools have gotten creative with their alternate uniforms, with both Army and Navy proudly flexing their creative muscle during their annual rivalry game. With that being said, if you haven't been paying attention to what Air Force has been doing with their alternate uniforms, then you're missing out on a treat when it comes to uniform creativity. The Falcons turned heads back in 2016 with their Legacy Series alternate uniforms that included helmets based on the famous shark tooth design that adorned plenty of fighter planes dating back to World War II.
Air Force made their mark on the college uniform landscape in 2016 and they've come back just as strong with their alternate uniforms for 2018. Their latest offering in the Legacy Series is based on the AC-130 gunship that has been utilized by the United States Air Force in some form or fashion since the 1960s. As such, the entire uniform is a monochrome shade of steel gray. The jerseys and pants are simple enough, which is good since you don't really want to take attention from what should be the real eye-catcher of this entire uniform.
I'm talking about the helmets, which are absolutely amazing. The artwork on the left side of the helmet utilizes what has been described as a "never before used technique" in order to place an incredibly detailed look at an AC-130 gunship in action.
The other side includes two different squadron patches. There's no word yet on whether or not this will differ from offense and defense in similar fashion to how Navy's helmets from the 2015 Army-Navy Game had a different naval ship hand-painted onto each helmet for certain positions. This could be the same case for these uniforms, or it could be an option for the team to decide on. Either way, it's an excellent example of paying attention to detail.
On top of all of those details, the back bumpers have the word "SPOOKY" emblazoned upon them, which is a clear nod to one of the variants of the AC-130 gunship.
Overall, it appears that the Air Force will once again take the title of best alternate uniforms in college football. There's really nothing bad that can be said about this uniform. If the goal was to make the players look like miniature AC-130 gunships complete with squadron emblems and all, then the designers absolutely nailed it. You're going to be hard-pressed to see a better alternate uniform at any level of football this season, much less in the FBS subdivision of college football.

Meghan Markle has officially received her own coat of arms, but the personalized emblem also breaks with royal tradition. The symbolic gift usually goes to the father of the bride ahead of the royal wedding, but this time the palace has decided to bestow this honor on only the Duchess of Sussex herself.
A Coat of Arms has been created for The Duchess of Sussex: https://t.co/mJb3mqZfaZ pic.twitter.com/0EgbiS29Rb — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 25, 2018
The custom design includes a blue background representing the Pacific Ocean and two golden rays signifying the sunshine of the Duchess's home state of California. The three quills embody "communication and the power of words," according to a statement from Kensington Palace. Meghan previously wrote her own lifestyle blog The Tig and she's also valued activism throughout her life. At just 11-years-old, she wrote a successful letter campaigning against a misogynistic advertising slogan.
Golden poppies, California's state flower, and wintersweet, which grows at her new home in Kensington Palace, sit below the shield. Both of these motifs also appeared on her wedding veil, along with flora representing all 53 Commonwealth countries.
The left side of the shield comes from Prince Harry's own coat of arms, with a harp for Ireland and lions representing Scotland and England. "The arms of a married woman are shown with those of her husband and the technical term is that they are impaled, meaning placed side by side in the same shield," the palace explained.
The lion holding one side — known as a "supporter" in heraldry — is another one of the Duke of Sussex's symbols. The red escallops on the collar actually come from his mother's coat of arms, but the majority of his design stems from the Queen's.

Now his lion joins another supporter representing his new wife. "The Supporter relating to The Duchess of Sussex is a songbird with wings elevated as if flying and an open beak, which with the quill represents the power of communication," the palace statement says.
At the top sits her assigned coronet, another rank symbol in heraldry. Hers actually applies to any sons and daughters of the Heir Apparent (in this case Prince Charles), according to the Royal Warrant of 1917. It includes two crosses patée, four fleurs-de-lys, and two strawberry leaves.
Meghan Markle worked closely with Thomas Woodcock, Garter King of Arms on the design of her new emblem, which Queen Elizabeth II approved. The final result undoubtedly reflects her background, but the shield does not include any elements specifically related to other members of her family.
This decision stands in contrast to Kate Middleton's coat of arms. Her father Michael Middleton received it as a gift before her wedding to Prince William. Three acorns — one for each of his children — symbolized the oaks in Berkshire, where they live. The gold chevron reflected the Duchess of Cambridge's mother, Carole Middleton, whose maiden name is Goldsmith.

While rumors initially suggested Meghan's father would receive a coat of arms, the palace statement made no mention of the Markle family. Thomas Markle of course made headlines before the May 19th wedding when he admitted to staging paparazzi photos of himself. The scandal coincided with a turn in his health and subsequent heart surgery prevented him from walking his daughter down the aisle as planned.
The Duchess of Sussex also received another special insignia. The statement released today also revealed Meghan's new letterhead: the letter M topped with a crown, the same as the coronet on her coat of arms.
Today was also the first time that @KensingtonRoyal sent out a press release using Meghan's official letterhead: pic.twitter.com/G3XSgXqW9m — Omid Scobie (@scobie) May 25, 2018
There's more coming down the pipeline too. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will likely receive a conjugal coat of arms in a few years, which shows their shields displayed side by side. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge received theirs in 2013, two years after they tied the knot.

These special gifts sure beat the regular, old monogrammed sheets on other wedding registries!

Bentley
To put Bentley's upcoming 100th birthday into perspective, consider the world in 1919.
World War One had ended less than a year before. Sound hadn't yet come to the movies. The population of the United States was but 104.5 million. (It's 327,174,341 as of yesterday.)
And the first-ever Bentley got rolling.
To celebrate, the company's adorning all 2019 Bentleys with a “Centenary Specification” package. Buyers will get uniquely developed Centenary Gold badge highlights, a Centenary Gold thread for your car's headrest logos, contrast stitching and cross stitching and a Centenary welcome light on the car's exterior.
Bentley
Centenary badges featuring gold accents and a reminder of the auspicious occasion (1919- 2019) are on deck, too. The gold will also be featured on your gear selector, key fob and your wheel's center caps. A special centenary welcome light will greet passengers.
Bentley
Centenary Gold, for those not familiar, is a refined metallic gold, with an elegant warm tone and a deep fluid shadow. Inspiration for some of the birthday designs were taken by the exquisite metalwork found on vintage Bentleys – such as EXP 2 of 1919 and the 1929 "Birkin’ Blower.”
Bentley
And if you don't want any gold or birthday wishes on your Bentley, it's ok with them. Each model's hand-made, remember.
It's been a long, exciting ride for this iconic brand. Through decades of expertise and innovation and support from loyalists who've seen challengers come and go and markets rise and fall, Bentley has designed, engineered and built the world’s most desirable Grand Tourers with a unique combination of luxury and performance.
Bentley
Yet it was all started by just one guy who, if he were alive today, would be 130 years old.
Bentley
W.O. Bentley grew up as an engineer enthusiast who loved trains. He eventually turned to building cars that would live up to his exacting, bespoke expectations as a driver, an engineer and, it's said, a gentleman. Bentley Motors was established in 1919 and by September 1921 the first production model was delivered to its owner, Noel van Raalte, at a cost of $1,357. (That's $19,767.18 in 2018 dollars. To give some perspective, oil changes alone for a Bentley Continental GT will currently cost around $500 for the year, and other required service will run you about $1,400 to $2,500 per year.)
Bentley
The car carried Bentley’s hallmark radiator casing and Flying ‘B’ insignia, even then. The Bentley models of the 1920s became some of the most distinctive cars of the era, and W.O. also became a fan of developing racing engines. His cars beat the pants off all challengers at Brooklands, Indianapolis and the Isle of Man. The legendary achievements of the Bentley Boys brought success at Le Mans on five occasions, too.
The Centenary Specification will be available on all Bentley models including the Continental GT, the Flying Spur sedan, the flagship Mulsanne and the Bentayga SUV.

LOS ANGELESIt's an easy law to break, and dog cheats do. By strapping a vest or backpack that says "service animal" to their pet, anyone can go in stores and restaurants where other dogs are banned, creating growing problems for the disabled community and business owners and leading to calls for better identifying the real deal.
Those with disabilities are worried about privacy and the safety of their highly trained service dogs, while business owners are concerned about health violations and damage to merchandise from impostors abusing the system.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, it's a federal crime to use a fake dog. And about a fourth of all states have laws against service animal misrepresentation. But privacy protections built into the laws make it nearly impossible to prosecute offenders. It's even more difficult because no papers are legally required for real service dogs. Often, people who want to take their pets into restaurants or retail stores just go online to buy vests, backpacks or ID cards with a "service animal" insignia.
The law says those entering businesses with animals can be asked just two questions: Is this a service dog? What is it trained to do for you?
Efforts to make the law more prosecutable have begun, but few agree on what will work best. Ideas range from ditching privacy to doing nothing.
Corey Hudson, chief executive officer of Canine Companions for Independence in San Rafael and president of Assistance Dogs International, a coalition of training schools, is leading the effort to get the U.S. Department of Justice involved. He started writing to the agency 18 months ago but has not received a response.
Hudson wants to open talks and explore ways to identify the real from the phony.
But the International Association of Assistance Dog Partners in Michigan worries that bringing in the Justice Department could set back access rights won by those with disabilities in the past 20 years.
"While we deplore those who might be so unethical as to impersonate a disabled person by dressing their dog up as a service animal, we equally deplore the frenzy of alarm being stirred up about the risk of such abuse," said Joan Froling, chairwoman of the IAADP.
There needs to be a standard, said Jennifer Arnold, founder of Canine Assistants in Atlanta. "The sticky part is who will do the testing and what will be the criteria for allowing dogs to be considered assistance dogs."
An ID card might be the simplest answer, she said, adding that she doesn't think the loss of privacy will be the big issue that some think it will be.
There is a big difference in the behavior of real service dogs and impostors inside businesses, experts said. A true service dog becomes nearly invisible. Pets might bark, urinate, sniff, scratch and eat off the floor.
Real service dogs can be the victims of unruly fakes, said Wallis Brozman, 27, of Santa Rosa. She has dystonia, a movement disorder that left her unable to walk and barely able to talk. She needs a wheelchair, voice amplifier and her service dog, Caspin, who responds to English and sign language.
"When my dog is attacked by an aggressive dog, he is not sure what to do about it and looks to me. It becomes a safety issue, not only for my dog, the target of the attack, but for me if I am between the dogs," Brozman said.
Business owners also face problems. In August, Russell Ireland banned a dog from his Oxford, Mass., diner after its owner put a plate of food on the floor for the dog.
James Glasser claimed it was a legitimate service animal and took part in a boycott of the diner. There was talk of a lawsuit. Ireland apologized. The dog's actual status is unclear.
Cook Justin Fisher said his boss' reputation took a beating. Business is just now returning to normal.
Marv Tuttle, a volunteer guide at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, said he believes he spots phony service dogs two or three times a week. He has also experienced the other side. Tuttle uses a service dog, Yara, because of a spinal cord injury from a traffic accident, and he and his wife were once stopped from entering a furniture store. "A girl greeted us and said she'd be glad to hold my dog outside," he said.
The clerk told them that two weeks earlier, a fake was allowed in the store and urinated on several expensive Indian carpets.
In terms of solving the dilemma, Tuttle doesn't think any kind of legislation will work.
"They can write new laws, but there is no way to enforce them. We don't have enough police to stop murders, much less stop people from hauling around pseudo service dogs," he said.

Story 138
As I reported in an earlier story, the launch of Sony’s PS4 Pro has been plagued by widespread problems with getting the console to ‘talk’ properly to TVs.
Some people have been getting no picture at all from their PS4 Pro, while others can’t get the console to output 4K and HDR at the same time even though their TVs seemingly should be able to handle it.
There are also many reports of people being unable to feed their PS4 Pros through AV receivers into their TVs even when those receivers apparently carry HDMI ports compatible with the necessary HDCP 2.2 digital rights management protocols and latest HDMI 2.0a specification.
PlayStation has already acknowledged problems with some TVs that will apparently need a firmware update (from either PlayStation or the TV manufacturers) to fix. However, reading through some of the complaints of PS4 Pro connection woes on various forums and social media feeds makes me suspect that at least a few of the issues some users are experiencing may be solvable without having to wait on Sony and/or the TV manufacturers to come up with new firmware.
Here, then, are nine things for afflicted PS4 Pro owners to try before they rip the last tufts of their hair out.
Please note that I’m assuming that your TV has a native 4K resolution, supports HDR, and has HDMIs that can support HDCP 2.2. If you’re not sure that your TV fits the bill on these points, check its specification with the manufacturer before exploring the tips below.
1. Make sure you’re using the correct HDMI port.
Some 4K TVs, especially budget models or sets from 2015, don’t support 4K HDR on all of their HDMIs. Consult your TV’s manual to ensure that the HDMI input you’ve got the PS4 Pro connected to is definitely up to spec.
Individual HDMI spec is something to check, too, if you’re experiencing issues with an AV receiver, as again it’s not uncommon for only a few HDMI ports on a receiver to support the latest specifications.
2. Make sure your HDMI port is switched to HDR mode
This, I suspect, will be by far the most common cause of fixable PS4 Pro connection problems. The thing is, with most HDR TVs you have to manually set an HDMI input to receive HDR signals. This crucial fact is hardly ever made clear enough in either TV instruction manuals or the instructions you get with external HDR sources like the PS4 Pro.
To make matters worse, every TV manufacturer calls the HDR mode on their HDMIs by a different name. With Samsung TVs, for instance, you have to go into the Picture menu and find the feature called HDMI UHD Color, and make sure it’s set to On for the PS4 Pro’s HDMI input. With LG TVs, the mode is called Deep Color, and again needs to be set specifically for the correct HDMI. With Panasonic TVs you just have two differently numbered HDMI ‘modes’ to choose from. And so the confusion spreads with every different brand of TV.
It’s not just TVs that are affected by this crazy situation either. AV receivers often have two 4K modes for their HDMIs, so try toggling between these for the HDMI your PS4 Pro is connected to. Bear in mind that some AV receivers only let you toggle their 4K HDMI modes on the units themselves, not via their onscreen menus.
3. Update ALL your firmware
Not running the most up to date software in your TV, console and even games could explain some of the issues people are experiencing.
For instance, it's been annoyingly common this year for some manufacturers to sell a TV as HDR ready that actually doesn't support HDR via its HDMIs until it's received a downloadable update - and sometimes these updates haven't appeared until weeks or even months after the TV launched.
If you have your TV permanently connected to the internet it's likely you will already have the latest software running. If you don't, though, add the set to your network and track down its 'software update' option, usually in its 'System' menus.
It's more likely that you'll have your PS4 Pro connected to your online network permanently, and if you do it will have done a firmware update when you first installed it. It's still worth selecting the System Update option in the Settings menus to check, though.
Finally, most PS4 Pro-enhanced games require you to download a patch before their HDR/extra resolution features are enabled. So again, be sure to be online with your PS4 Pro next time you play an enhanced title, so that the update can be applied.
4. Perform a factory reset of your PS4 Pro
For some reason (possibly because the PS4 Pro potentially stores information on the information it first receives from your TV) resetting the PS4 Pro to its factory settings can fix some people's connection issues.
This solution is especially effective for people (such as some LG TV owners) who are still struggling with connection issues despite their TVs receiving firmware updates that were supposed to fix the problem, and for people who initially either connected their PS4 Pro to the wrong HDMI port on their TV, or who initially tried running the PS4 Pro through an incompatible AV receiver.
You can reset the PS4 Pro to factory settings by entering its Safe mode. Instructions on how to do this are included in point 7 of this article.
5. Take your AV receiver out of the equation.
As hinted in passing in the previous point, if you’re looping your PS4 Pro via HDMI through a receiver and tip 2 hasn’t worked, try connecting the console directly to your TV.
Hardly any older receivers will support HDCP 2.2 and/or the necessary data bandwidths through their HDMIs, and I’m hearing plenty of anecdotal information to suggest that even models that are apparently up to HDCP 2.2 spec aren’t passing the PS4 Pro data through as they should. Or more accurately, they don’t seem to be feeding back the capabilities of the TV properly to the PS4 Pro.
Within my own set up I’ve discovered that if I connect my PS4 Pro directly to my Samsung KS9500 (KS9800 US) TV I get HDR RGB support, whereas if I loop my PS4 Pro through a Samsung K950 sound bar I can only get HDR YUV420 support. Even though the HDMI loopthrough on the K950 has appeared to be completely neutral with other source kit.
If removing the amp from the HDMI equation works for you then you’ll have to connect your PS4 Pro to your receiver via the console’s optical digital audio output if you want it to make use of your sound system.
6. Check your HDMI cable/HDMI splitter
It’s possible that the HDMI cable you’re running between your PS4 Pro and TV can’t carry enough data to deliver the full 4K HDR experience.
This isn’t as likely to be the cause of any problems if you’re using a short cable run, and the cable you get with the PS4 Pro works just fine. But if you’re not using the cable provided by Sony, it’s still worth giving that cable a go to see if it makes any difference.
Cable issues are much more likely to be a factor if you’re using a long cable run. If you are, make sure the HDMI cable you’re using is ‘Premium Certified’, meaning it has actually been certified as capable of handling 4K HDR levels of data.
Premium Certified cables do not have to cost substantially more than ‘ordinary’ HDMIs, by the way. This isn’t something you need to be spending hundreds of pounds on!
Also, if you’re getting sound but not a picture, as many people are reporting, this is not going to be your cable’s fault, as cable failure is an ‘all or nothing’ deal.
Some people run their sources through HDMI splitters into multiple screens. If that’s you, then again you need to make sure that your HDMI splitter is up to 4K HDR spec. Which very few are, as it happens.
7. Run your PS4 Pro in Safe mode and change the HDCP setting from 2.2 to 1.4
This solution was put forward by Sony on its EU forums in response to all the feedback from PS4 Pro users who can’t get any sort of picture to appear on their TVs. It goes like this:
1. Access Safe Mode on your PS4. To do this you need to turn off the PS4 Pro by pressing the power button on the front panel of the console. Once the PS4 Pro is fully off, press and hold the power button down again for around seven seconds until you hear a second ‘power up’ beep. Then connect your joystick via USB, and press its PS button.
2. Select option 8 (HCDP Mode adjustment)
3. Select option 2 (HDCP 1.4)
4. Your system will restart when you select OK.
This solution should mean that pretty much anyone who hasn’t previously managed to get an image from their PS4 Pro will be able to see one. However, since the HDCP 2.2 level of digital rights management is required for playback of many 4K HDR sources, this HDCP 1.4 solution is very far from ideal, and is clearly being proposed as only a temporary solution until a better firmware fix can be provided by either your TV manufacturer or Sony.
It’s worth repeating Sony’s Safe Mode disclaimer, too: “Some Safe Mode options could result in loss of data. We do not recommend using Safe Mode unless you are experiencing issues with your PS4 and one of our support articles has directed you to perform a step in Safe Mode.”
8. Make sure you're playing an HDR- and/or 4K-compatible game
This may sound like a no-brainer to some, but there seems to be a lot of confusion out there about how the PS4 Pro enhancements work in relation to games, especially where HDR is concerned. The bottom line is that only games that have been remastered to work in HDR will actually play in HDR. The PS4 Pro doesn't magically add HDR to titles that don't have HDR written into their code.
A list of PS4 Pro-enhanced games can be found here - but just to confuse you more, these enhancements can come in a variety of flavors, with some titles just adding HDR, some just adding higher resolutions, and some adding both. Remember, too, that as noted in an earlier point you have to download the HDR/resolution patch that's been retrospectively launched for many of the current enhanced titles, otherwise you'll see no enhancements at all.
Your PS4 Pro will only actually switch to HDR output if you start playing a game that's encoded for HDR; the console's home screen is not HDR by default. So fire up a game such as Deus Ex: Mankind Divided or Uncharted 4 and see if you get an HDR playback confirmation message on your TV (or see if your TV's menus have switched to HDR picture settings if your model is one of those, like 2015 Samsungs, that doesn't give some sort of 'HDR is now playing' onscreen message).
It's unlikely that firing up an HDR game will suddenly alert the PS4 Pro to your TV's HDR capabilities if the console hasn't already detected them and revealed this in the Video Output Settings. But it's worth a shot.
Where resolution is concerned, I have received reports of people being told in the PS4 Pro's Video Output Information screen that their TV can only support 2K, only to have the console's 4K output magically kick in anyway when a resolution-enhanced title such as Rise Of The Tomb Raider is played.
9. Try changing the RGB range and the resolution
This solution probably won’t work for many people, as the way the HDR/4K system works with the PS4 Pro is so dependent on what capabilities the console auto detects from your TV. But if you’re not getting HDR images when you think you should be, head into the Video Output Settings part of the Sound and Screen options and change the RGB range from Automatic to Limited. Or try changing the Resolution setting from Auto to 2160 RGB or 2160 YUV. It’s a long shot, but hell - if nothing else has worked this is a pretty easy last throw of the dice.
Given the range of problems being reported around the PS4 Pro’s TV connectivity it’s possible - probable, even - that there may be other potential solutions I’ve not thought of. If you think you have one, feel free to share it in the comments - or send it to me via my Twitter feed so that I can add it to this article. And finally... Good luck!

September 2018 - final test
The year we’ve spent with the Insignia has flown by. It seems like it’s just getting into its stride as it makes its way back to Vauxhall preparing for its second life as a used car.
In that time the Insignia has provided almost 14,000 trouble-free miles, with fuel consumption that has seemed to improve away from the commute to a genuine 60-plus mpg.
I know I’ve said it before, but it’s remarkable for a car this size and with its decent performance.
I remember during Fleet News Award judging earlier this year, although it didn’t take the win in its category (Vauxhall’s poor sales year in 2017 played its part), there was no end of praise for the Insignia’s capabilities.
It makes so many things about the ownership experience easy, whether it’s steering into a parking space, preventing you from straying outside the lane marking and into danger, swallowing a load of luggage on the way to the airport, or spending the day pounding along the motorway.
I was worried when I first tried this SRi VX-Line Nav that there was no lumbar support for the driver’s seat, but, in the end, it was never a problem. The seat comfort and support is as good as anything else available for the money.
There are more wins than fails when it comes to ergonomics, too. The process of entering POI destinations in the navigation is a bit hit and miss, and the voice control functions are sometimes uncooperative.
But the optional head up display has the easiest height adjustment of any on the market, and I loved the way the heated seat function monitors the outside temperature so that on cold days they are already on.
The Insignia is a far more smartly developed and user-friendly car than its predecessor, and now that I’m seeing more on the roads, I’m sure company car drivers and fleets are also recognising its strengths.

August 2018 - 40th birthday special Insignia Grand Sport and 1980's Cavalier comparison
Our current long-termer, the Vauxhall Insignia, is, objectively speaking, one of the best large family cars on sale today.
Brimming with safety and convenience features in this SRi grade, along with a handful of desirable options, anyone driving it as their company car would want for little.
But how would a company car from Vauxhall produced 40 years ago (when Fleet News was born) measure up?
We thought it would be fun to ‘re-test’ the Vauxhall Cavalier, which was introduced in 1976, essentially a replacement for the Victor.
Based on the Opel Ascona, the Cavalier’s front end was taken from the Opel Manta to give it a Vauxhall identity (at the time Vauxhalls and Opels were sold alongside each other across Europe).
The Cavalier was initially produced in Antwerp, Belgium. It arrived at a crucial point in the timeline of company cars.
Ford’s Cortina Mk 3 was looking tired and dated, and the then recently partly-nationalised British Leyland had spent the decade in crisis.
The Cavalier was an instant hit and, from 1977, production was expanded to Luton.
We got behind the wheel of a Luton-built 1980 Cavalier 2000 GLS saloon – effectively the range-topping engine and equipment grade combination – and this beautifully-preserved example in the Vauxhall heritage collection has just 36,000 miles on the clock.
Finished in royal red paint and with a luxurious black vinyl roof, it certainly looks the part in isolation, but is dwarfed alongside the Insignia.
The Cavalier is 4,445mm long, 1,651mm wide and 1,384mm high, riding on 13-inch Rostyle wheels; the Insignia is 4,897mm long, 1,863mm wide and 1,455mm high with 17-inch alloys.
Some of the highlights of the Cavalier’s spec include a rev counter, a clock, push-button LW/MW radio, a four-spoke steering wheel, velour-covered seats and fully-upholstered doors.
Its 2.0-litre engine produced 100PS which, combined with four-speed manual transmission, allowed the Cavalier to sprint from 0-60mph in 10.5 seconds.
The six-speed Insignia produces 135PS and reaches 60 in 9.9 seconds with much better fuel consumption – 65.7mpg compared with the Cavalier’s meagre 28mpg.
I spent around 140 miles behind the wheel of the Cavalier, and it was largely smooth and comfortable even by today’s standards.
Engine refinement was good, although there was little done to suppress noise intrusion to the cabin in the 1970s.
The rev counter was showing 3,000rpm plus at 60mph in top gear, which we had all forgotten about in these times of six-speed gearboxes and modern turbocharged petrol and diesel engines.
No power steering makes the Cavalier harder work around town and to park.
The Insignia not only has power steering, it can also steer itself into a parallel or perpendicular parking space, and while this and other convenience systems such as the head-up display, sat-nav and Wi-Fi show the march of technology across seven generations of car, the improvements in safety are mind-boggling.
The Cavalier has front seatbelts and that’s pretty much all there is to say about it with regard to safety.
The Insignia has sophisticated brakes with ABS, electronic stability control, and sensors that warn the driver to intervene during a collision risk, with the car applying the brakes itself as a last resort.
These warning messages are repeated in the head-up display, including when a pedestrian or cyclist is detected ahead to ensure the driver has spotted them.
There are airbags everywhere and seatbelts in the rear. Sensors and cameras read speed limit and other traffic signs help keep the Insignia within its lane markings and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front when in cruise control.
Warning lights in the door mirrors alert the driver of approaching vehicles in the blindspot, while these same sensors can also warn of approaching traffic or people when reversing out of a parking space.
The advance in vehicle safety features during the lifespan of Fleet News has no doubt saved the lives of many company car drivers, or at least reduced the severity of injuries.
These features in the Insignia, competing in a sector of the car market that’s around 80% fleet, is doubly comforting considering Fleet News has been at the forefront of campaigning for improved safety over the years.

Vauxhall may be slightly optimistic about the Insignia's fuel economy, but it would be impossible to replicate in a petrol car.
The Insignia’s consistency in regularly achieving more than 60mpg cannot be over-emphasised.
You may be familiar with economy runs where drivers deliberately try techniques that should deliver better fuel consumption than official figures.
This ‘who can be the most frugal?’ contest is also sometimes played out at car media launches when, given we journalists are so competitive, it’s difficult to resist the temptation to deny a writer from a rival publication the glory of winning.
That said, without resorting to this kind of frugal driving, the Insignia Grand Sport has still achieved impressive figures.
Most of my journeys in it have been long – 100-plus miles.
I travel locally occasionally, but it’s usually driven to airports or meetings.
Often there is congestion on these routes, with a few miles of slow-moving traffic, so it isn’t as if the car and its 136PS diesel engine escapes the challenges of urban driving.
The trip computer on the Insignia’s last tank of diesel read 72.1mpg.
We know from an earlier update that the car is a little optimistic about its achievement. But measuring brim to brim, it still achieves 68.5mpg.
With customers deserting diesel for a variety of reasons it’s worth pointing out that it would be impossible to achieve fuel economy like this in a similar-sized petrol car in everyday driving.
And, unless every journey was short and urban-based, it would be extremely unlikely in a petrol hybrid, too.

WLTP ups the Insignia Grand Sports' BIK by 5% but fuel consumption remains impressive, says Simon Harris
Had you taken delivery of an Insignia Grand Sport as your company car at the same time as us last spring, you would have chosen a large family hatchback with competitive CO2 emissions of 114g/km.
At the time, the Insignia fell into the 24% BIK tax band. And, if it will be your company car for the next few years, your BIK tax will rise progressively, with a spike for 2018/19 because of the change in the diesel supplement from 3% to 4%.
Essentially, the first year BIK tax bill for a 40% taxpayer was £2,183.53 for the car without the options fitted.
However, were you to take delivery of an identical model now, you’d be facing a significantly higher tax bill.
This is because the car has now been recalibrated under the new WLTP test cycle, with a correlated CO2 emissions figure. It now has emissions of 124g/km and falls into the 29% bracket for BIK.
Inflation and a five percentage point higher BIK tax band as the starting point will give a 40% taxpayer a first year bill of £2,813.15 – more than £50 extra a month.
Under WLTP, intended to be more reflective of real-world driving, the car now has an official fuel consumption of 60.1mpg on the combined cycle.
But, during the past few days, I’ve more or less matched the old NEDC figure of 65.7mpg. This means CO2 emissions would have been more in line with the original 114g/km.
The Insignia’s fuel consumption has been impressive for such a large car that never feels lacking in performance. It’s a surprise that it has been reaching the old NEDC figure, let alone bettering the more ‘realistic’ WLTP data.

After taking the Insignia to the dealer network, Simon Harris reflects on the future of Vauxhall.
It’s a long time since I’ve spent any significant time behind the wheel of a Vauxhall. It’s even longer since I had the opportunity to interact with its dealer network.
Recently we received a notice from Vauxhall that a safety check needed to be carried out on the rear seatbelts of our Insignia Grand Sport, and perhaps with claims of slow reactions over fire risks with the second-generation Zafira, the company is extra keen to ensure any problems are dealt with promptly.
While Fleet News is located on the outskirts of the sprawling Peterborough metropolis, I’m based in the Lincolnshire fens.
It meant that rather than using the main dealer in Peterborough, around 15 miles away, it was more convenient for me to travel just six miles to Taylor’s of Spalding.
Set along a busy main road in the town, the facility feels as modern as the one in Peterborough, and the friendly service desk staff were able to accommodate me within 48 hours of my call.
The work was carried out within 10 minutes, and I was on my way again with barely enough time to drink my complimentary hot chocolate. There was no problem with our car.
Much has been written about Vauxhall dealers recently, with an expected downsizing of the retail network following the brand’s takeover by PSA.
It was reported in April that contracts would be terminated and retailers would need to reapply to take on the franchise again.
No doubt dealers will act in their best interests, but it would be a pity if the network was to lose any of its quality outlets.

The Grand Sport name might be daft but the performance is very impressive, as Simon Harris reveals.
There are so many new cars launched each year that it’s impossible, even for someone whose job often involves evaluating the latest vehicles, to try every one in timely fashion.
So I was happy to finally get behind the wheel of the latest Vauxhall Insignia this month, and put around 700 miles on it.
While the Grand Sport name is a bit of a daft alternative to hatchback, the car is, for the most part, very impressive.
I was surprised that our SRi model was priced at just under £23,000 (of course, most large end-user fleets will pay much less) and by the value of some of the options fitted.
For example, the head-up display is priced at £290. These displays can give cars a real premium feel. This one shows speed, traffic sign and navigation information so drivers can see the figures without taking their eyes off the road. Compare this with a premium alternative such as a BMW 3 Series, which would set you back £825.
The Insignia’s sophisticated, automatically adjustable LED headlights at £1,010 are a bit steep, but priced in line with rivals, although we’d probably leave those well alone.
It’s also disappointing to see car manufacturers making money out of flat paint finishes. It used to be that metallic paint, or black paint commanded a premium.
On the Insignia, only Aegean blue is described as ‘solid’. Non-metallic summit white, and lava red (as on our test car), are listed in brochures as ‘brilliant’ (no more brilliant than other solid paint), and command a premium of £285.
Someone please put a stop to this.

Luke Neal finds that automatic phone locks and accidental lock-outs are easily resolved with the Insignia
Our Insignia comes equipped with Apple CarPlay which Apple calls ‘the ultimate co‑pilot’.
It says: ‘CarPlay is a smarter, safer way to use your iPhone in the car. CarPlay takes the things you want to do with your iPhone while driving and puts them on your car’s built-in display.
'You can get directions, make calls, send and receive messages, and listen to music, all in a way that allows you to stay focused on the road.’
When entering the car, my phone automatically connects via Bluetooth to the Insignia in seconds. Done. But if I plug my phone in to charge, it automatically disconnects my phone from the car and activates Apple CarPlay.
This, currently, can only be used by manually unlocking my phone to access its functions. It’s very frustrating.
I recently received a call while driving but couldn’t answer it without finding my phone and unlocking it first which prompted me to look through my CarPlay connectivity options.
It’s worth noting that drivers do have the option for CarPlay to function while the phone is locked, which might be useful for some, or to forget the connection completely and stick to the Insignia’s perfectly good Bluetooth phone connection and sat-nav which are already built in.
As I don’t want to access the majority of my iPhone’s functions while on the move (and I also find CarPlay sometimes slow to react) I have chosen the later.
On a recent trip, I mistakenly locked the Insignia keys in the boot and the keyless entry wouldn’t function.
After a few moments of panic, I realised this was because the boot was only caught on the first latch and not fully closed.
Once I had pushed it tight shut, the keyless entry was able to recognise the key was in close range and allowed the boot to open. Phew!

Luke Neal debates whether the Insignia's head-up-display is an important addition for business drivers in his long term review.
Our Insignia is equipped with a head-up display (£290) which is optional on all Insignia Nav models with the exception of the Design trim level.
It’s the first long-term vehicle I’ve driven that is fitted with one.
As you are probably aware, a head-up display (sometimes known as HUD) presents data without requiring users to take their eyes off the road.
It was developed for military aviation so pilot’s eyes do not need to refocus to view the outside after looking at the in-cockpit instruments.
The Vauxhall display shows current speed, rpm, gear change indicator and collision warning but will also display turn-by-turn directions when navigation is in use. It feels like an important safety addition, keeping drivers’ eyes facing forward.
Previously I’ve often wondered whether a head-up display is just an annoyance or distraction.
Not so. In fact, quite the opposite, I find I rarely even notice the head-up display and, instead, look to the car’s conventional speedometer and navigation screen for information.
However, a colleague has recently commented on how useful he finds the head-up display. Whether it’s an important addition for business drivers may well be judged on a case-by-case basis.
Another important safety system included on our car is lane departure warning with lane assist.
It comes as part of Driving Assistance Pack One which also includes:
Forward collision alert with automatic city emergency braking
Following distance indicator
Traffic sign recognition
Lane departure is an impressive system which keeps the car between the white lines should you need it. If you change lanes, without indicating, the system will fight to keep you within your lane until you have crossed the white lines.
It can be switched off by a dash-mounted button or overridden when the indicator is used.

After two months of testing, Luke Neal has grown attached to the Vauxhall Insignia Grand Sport.
I have received positive comments on its premium good looks and the 1,845 miles have seen it begin to loosen up nicely.
It has an impressive turn of speed for a relatively small (1.6-litre 136PS eco tech) diesel engine and is returning a healthy average fuel consumption of 55mpg which is impressive compared to the Equa Index ‘real world’ figure of 47.9mpg but still shy of the manufacturer’s claimed 65.7mpg.
On the subject of fuel (and it’s only a minor point), the fuel flap on this car is huge.
I was expecting to at least find the AdBlue filler inside to justify its enormous size, but there is nothing but the fuel cap.
I will have to consult the owner’s manual to locate the AdBlue filler as I haven’t been able to find any details online.
Our VX line trim car has many optional extras fitted over and above the standard and with cold weather just around the corner, I am pleased our car has the Winter Pack Four as an optional (£410) extra.
The pack includes three stage-heated front seats and a heated front windscreen which, from past experiences, will be an absolute joy on frosty mornings.
I have recently discovered that the heated seats can be set to automatically activate via the on-screen vehicle settings menu so I have already begun enjoying their benefits.
The car also has a heated flat-bottomed leather steering wheel which is part of the VX line trim rather than the Winter Pack, although it is available as an optional extra on other Insignia trim levels.

The first test of the Vauxhall Insignia Grand Sport reveals it to be good looking, well specced and fuel efficient.
We first drove the Insignia Grand Sport back in March.
It’s certainly a good looking car and editor Stephen Briers said at the time: “We were always a fan of the underrated Insignia’s exterior and the new car retains its position as one of the best looking in its class.”
Our long term vehicle is an SRI VX Line Nav, costing £22,960 on the road.
It comes well equipped with Navi 900 Intellilink system and driving assistance pack one, which consists of: forward collision alert with automatic city emergency braking, following distance indicator and lane departure warning with lane assist.
It also has the VXR styling pack (sports-style front and rear bumpers, side sills and visible tailpipe) and of course, Vauxhall OnStar.
We also opted for additional extras of head-up display, intelligent headlights, DAP 4, wireless charging, eight-inch instrument display, brilliant paint and winter pack four (heated front seats and windscreen) pushing the price up to £26,125.
Under the bonnet is a 1.6-litre diesel engine which develops 136PS and 320Nm of torque. It isn’t the most efficient unit in the range (that’s the 1.6 110PS turbo diesel with CO2 emissions of 105g/km).
But with CO2 emissions of 114g/km and combined fuel consumption of 65.7mpg it’s likely to be the best balance of performance and efficiency.
Inside, the dashboard is home to two eight-inch screens, the first is the touchscreen Navi 900 intellilink display which controls the audio functions, navigation, bluetooth and vehicle settings as well as Apple Carplay and Android Auto.
The second is a digital instrument display which, along with the speedometer and rev counter can be customised to display fuel economy, average speed, tyre pressure information and oil life.
The interior has a premium feel, there is a good blend of leather and soft-touch materials, smart metallic detailing and ‘mood’ lighting.
There is plenty of legroom for both front and rear seat passengers and the boot’s 490 litres feels cavernous.
Economy-wise it’s returning an average 56mpg (just 10mpg below the official figure).

Since the beginning of summer, football clubs from all across Europe have been unveiling their kits for the upcoming season. With the start of the 2019/20 Premier League and Ligue 1 only a few days away (Germany’s Bundesliga, Spain’s La Liga and Italy’s Serie A kick off in the following weeks), we’ve curated a list of the best football kits from the upcoming seasons.
This year’s list features more Away kits than Home, due to the fact that clubs can experiment more outside of their signature colors with the former style. That tends to produce more eye-catching looks, while still incorporating the team’s ethos and resonating with their fans.
While you wait for the actual games to begin, read through our list of the top 10 football kits for the upcoming 2019/20 season, with new looks from the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1. Pick up the latest kit for your favorite team, or, even if you’re not a football fan, you can add some shop for new styles to add some athletic flair to your streetwear staples. Let us know your favorites — as well as which team you’ll be supporting — in the comments.
Leicester City – Away Kit
1 of 2 2 of 2
Although the color is rarely seen in the Premier League, pink is the star player of Juventus’ 2015/16 away kit — which was made famous by Drake back in 2016 and subsequently became a must have item for both streetwear and football enthusiasts around the globe. Leicester City is now looking to tap into that same hype with its 2019/20 away kit, which features the bold pink hue throughout. Contrasting black then hits adidas’ Three Stripes branding on the sleeves, along with the sponsorship branding, adidas‘ insignia on the right chest and Leicester’s celebrated club badge on the left.
Price: £55 GBP (approximately $69 USD)

Paris Saint-Germain – Away Kit
1 of 2 2 of 2
After embellishing Paris Saint-Germain‘s third kit last year (which was worn frequently during the Champions League), Jordan Brand has been promoted to designing the club’s away fixtures. Dressed in an eye-catching “Infrared” color scheme, the standout co-branded kit is definitely helping to elevate the growing relationship between streetwear and football. Contrasting hits of black can be found circling the sleeves and collar, along with the Jumpman insignia featured on the right chest, the club’s celebrated badge on the left and finally the sponsorship branding.
Price: €149 EUR (approximately $156 USD)

Real Madrid – Home Kit
1 of 2 2 of 2
Although they got knocked out of the Champions League in the Round-of-16, Real Madrid looks to start the 2019/20 season off right with a clean, crisp Home kit. The fresh white jersey is detailed with the perfect balance of regal gold — taking inspiration from the club’s crown spotlighted on its crest — found on the Three Stripes branding, FIFA Championship badge and “Fly Emirates” sponsor logo
Price: $90 USD ($130 USD for the Authentic)
Where to buy: adidas.com and realmadrid.com
Liverpool – Away Kit
1 of 2 2 of 2
Another fresh white iteration comes way of Liverpool‘s Away kit. Unlike its signature bold red Home jersey, this minimalistic take pays homage to the club’s first European Cup win back in 1977. Other subtle details include a graphic pattern which represents the street signs seen around Anfield stadium, along with the signature of famous manager Bob Paisley found inside of the neck. Blue and red detailing help to elevate the piece without going overboard.
Price: $95 USD

Arsenal – Away Kit
1 of 2 2 of 2
Arsenal returns to its adidas roots this year, so it’s only fitting the club’s Away kit draws upon the iconic “bruised banana” kit worn during the early ’90s. The updated jersey features the same classic design, albeit a bit toned down, such as the zig-zag pattern and hits of navy blue. adidas also managed to do wonders for Arsenal’s Home kit, however their Away kit was slightly stronger in our opinion.
Price: $90 USD
Where to buy: adidas.com and arsenal.com
Bayern Munich – Home Kit
adidas has once again nailed Bayern Munich‘s kit. Unlike the red-and-white-stripped pattern of previous seasons, this year’s kit sees the German giant introduce a new diamond-pattern — inspired by Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena home stadium — to the lauded kit. When seen from afar, the graphic design gives the kit an almost quitted look. Finally, the Three Stripes branding on the sleeve blends in with the outfit’s signature red color palette.
Price: €90 EUR (approximately $100 USD)
Where to buy: adidas.com and fcbayern.com
AS Roma – Away Kit
1 of 2 2 of 2
Inspired by Jupiter, the Roman God of the Sky, AS Roma‘s Away kit features a lightening bolt graphic running diagonally across the chest. Dressed in hues of crimson red, orange and yellow, the bolt makes a striking appearance on the white jersey and makes the Giallorossi look as though they’re wearing a sash. With Roma’s famous colors intact, the kit remains true to the club’s identity while celebrating the city’s mythology.
Price: €91 EUR (approximately $101 USD)
Where to buy: nike.com and asromastore.com
Chelsea – Away Kit
1 of 2 2 of 2
Chelsea’s new clean Nike kits are inspired by the 1960s Mod culture, which once thrived on the club’s doorstep of King’s Road. The polo jersey is predominately dressed in white while hits of blue and red trim both sleeves and the button-down neck collar. Two buttons at the neck inscribed with “The Pride of London” help to finish off the overall look of the kits, along with a blue Swoosh insignia on the right chest and Chelsea’s club badge on the left.
Price: €90 EUR (approximately $100 USD)
Where to buy: nike.com and chelseamegastore.com
Inter Milan – Away Kit
1 of 3 2 of 3 3 of 3
Inter Milan‘s stunning mint-colored Away outfit is no doubt one of the best kits Europe has to offer for the 2019/20 season. Complemented with black and gold embellishments, the jersey also pays homage to the city of Milan as well as the club’s recent triumphs. The aquamarine color also dressed the goalkeeper’s kit worn by Julio Cesar during the 2009/2010 season, the same season that saw Inter claim their historic treble in the Champion’s League, Serie A and Coppa Italia.
Price: €91 EUR (approximately $101 USD)
Where to buy: nike.com and inter.it
Barcelona – Home Kit
1 of 3 2 of 3 3 of 3
For the first time in the club’s history, Barcelona have ditched their iconic stripe design for a new checkerboard pattern. The new revamp is to honor the city, specifically the Eixample district, which is home to many iconic buildings designed by Antoni Gaudí. The yellow and red colors of the Catalan flag remain at the collar to the delight of fans.

Story 141
Hiring a taxi in Paris can be costly if you don’t understand how the system works. That’s because there are many choices and a lot of illegitimate or unscrupulous operators who may charge up to triple the government authorized rate.
Gare du Nord (the main railroad hub in the northern part of Paris from Charles de Gaulle airport) is a perfect example. It snags many unsuspecting tourists with huge fares by unscrupulous operators.
I am often in the city and usually take the RER B train from CDG to this point, and then a taxi to my hotel. In front of the station are many drivers soliciting their unlicensed taxi services. They will lie about what the normal rates should be for other cabs, which means the charges can be exorbitant. They will also tell you they are “regular” taxis, implying they are licensed, when they are not.
Often the unsophisticated tourist will not know the difference until it is too late. Example: my colleague and I were accosted by multiple taxi drivers and told the fare would be about 55 Euros to our hotel which was only a couple of miles away. Our actual fare from a licensed taxi was about 10 Euros.
At Gare du Nord, as with every other facility, there is an official taxi queue at the side of the station. The rogue drivers congregate in front of the main entrance to catch the unsuspecting. Unless you read the signs or know the location of the designated queue point, you can end up paying a lot for your lack of knowledge. If you choose one of these scammers, they can overcharge, drive you in circles around the city to jack up the fares, refuse to give you change for larger denomination bills, will not accept credit cards, and may demand extra payments for luggage or passengers. That is why only regulated taxis can be trusted.
Legitimate and licensed taxis are very distinctive: they all have a roof status sign with green or red LED lights to indicate their availability. You should never get into a taxi that does not display this signage. However, you should also learn what the authorized displays look like, because of course there are counterfeits as well, although there are heavy penalties for the drivers if they are caught.
A registered taxi in Paris will always have a roof-top status light and sign.If you stay at a hotel, be warned that having the concierge or desk attendant call for a cab can cost extra in addition to the base fare. Until three years ago, customers were billed for the distance the cab had to drive to get to your location! I have noticed that drivers will enter higher amounts because they assume the passenger does not know the difference.
The better practice is to flag a taxi on the street or go to a specified taxi stand, which are in most of the popular locations. Hotels can also get a kickback from drivers for longer trips, especially to airports. They will rarely if ever disclose this to their guests, who assume that the hotel is looking out for their best interests.
Pay attention to the display on the rearview mirror when you get into the cab. The number on the right is the minimum fee that is built into the overall fare.
Marc Weber Tobias
Legal taxis will always have the following attributes:
A mileage meter with the displayed price as it accrues;
A physical plaque with its license number;
Some form of insignia on the windshield;
A lighted display on the roof.
Be certain that you have enough cash to cover your fare, because most taxis do not accept credit cards. However, the exception to this rule are those cabs that go to any of the airports.
There are three primary taxi companies in Paris, and they all have smartphone apps: G7 (331 41 27 66 77), Alpha Taxi (331 45 85 85 85), Taxi Bleu (331 49 36 1010).
How fares are computed
There are many variables in fares for licensed cabs in Paris:
Airport or within the city: There are fixed fares in Paris to travel to the airports from within the city, usually 50-55 Euros, depending on whether from the right or left bank.
Pre-booking: While you might think that pre-booking a cab would be a good idea, it will cost extra. Usually, the fee for doing so is up to 7 Euros;
Initial costs: The normal initial cost is 2.60-4 Euros;
Mileage charge: The price per kilometer can vary from 1.07-1.29 Euros, depending on the day of the week;
Day or night charges: Prices per kilometer and time will change, depending on the time of day;
Additional passenger cost: there is an extra cost of 4 Euros for each passenger if there are more than four people in a taxi;
Additional luggage costs: there can be a charge for more than two pieces of luggage, or for a large suitcase;
Within Paris, or outside of the city: Charges can vary, depending on whether you are within the city, or outside of its boundaries;
Time computation: There are three tiers of charges for time per minute that the taxi is not moving, depending on your location. If a pre-booked a taxi, it will cost 35,80 Euros per hour for them to wait for you.
If you don’t understand Paris taxis and how they work, it can cost you a lot of money. The city is notorious for illegitimate cabs that operate outside the licensing regulations. Knowing what to avoid and the Apps to use can make your travel much less costly.
My preference for cost and accessibility is Uber, primarily because I do not have to use cash and I can get a taxi just about anywhere, based on my GPS location. In foreign cities, you will likely not know exactly where you are. That means it is impossible to call for a cab to pick you up at a specific location unless GPS-based. The minimum fare for Uber is 6 Euros, with .30 Euros/minute, and 1.05 Euros/Kilometer.

Transmeta
The Transmeta Crusoe was perhaps the most creatively engineered processor available around the new millenium. Rather than directly implement a particular instruction set, the Crusoe used a software abstraction layer called "Code Morphing Software" to translate guest software instructions into native instructions on the Crusoe. While this was only commercially used for x86 compatibility, the Crusoe was demonstrated running Java bytecode directly.
The Crusoe also had the benefit of having lower power consumption and running cooler than contemporary Intel and AMD CPUs, which made it popular for notebook and ultra mobile PCs. It was used in the Compaq TC1000, Toshiba Libretto L-series, and OQO Model 01, among others. The 128-bit Crusoe was replaced with the Efficeon in 2004, though the company pivoted away from designing CPUs shortly thereafter. Transmeta's influence can still be felt in newer products, as their power management techniques were licensed to NVIDIA, among others.

Who could replace John Bercow as House of Commons Speaker?
Who could replace John Bercow as House of Commons Speaker?
John Bercow has fired the starting gun on the race to replace him as one of parliament's most senior and influential people - the Speaker of the House of Commons.
His successor will be charged with keeping the parliamentary agenda running smoothly - including sometimes making controversial decisions about what MPs should vote on - as well as mantaining order in the Commons chamber.
So who could take the top job when it becomes vacant on 31 October - the day that Mr Becow has said he will resign on and also the date of the UK's scheduled departure from the EU?
Here's a full list of all the runners and riders to take on the role:
Harriet Harman
Harriet Harman: 'I'll bring robustness'
The former deputy Labour Party leader is among the favourites to become the new Speaker.

As the longest-serving current female MP, having first been elected to parliament in 1982, she is known as the "Mother of the House".
Having held a number of roles in Tony Blair's government, she was later elected Labour's deputy leader under Gordon Brown.
She stepped up to lead the party during the 2015 leadership election to pick a successor to Ed Miliband.
Since then, the qualified solicitor has remained strictly on the Commons back benches, but played an important role as chair of a parliamentary committee on human rights.
She told Sky News she would be a "robust" Speaker.
"I've been there a long time and therefore they all know me and they know they can trust me and they know that I really care about our democracy," the Camberwell and Peckham MP said.
"I think it also needs a real firm hand on the tiller. It needs somebody who is really tough, with a bit of the hind of a rhino.
"Because the government, really, is always tempted to push parliament around."
Sir Lindsay Hoyle
Image: Lindsay Hoyle has been an MP since 1997
Someone already familiar with the job is Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who has been the Commons deputy speaker for more than nine years.
Elected to parliament in 1997 as the Labour MP for Chorley, he is used to telling colleagues off for bad behaviour or speeches that go on too long.
He threw his hat into the ring to replace Mr Bercow with a promise to provide "the stability and leadership the House of Commons requires in order to remain at the centre to our political system".
Sir Lindsay said there was "much more work to do" to build on Mr Bercow's efforts to make parliament more diverse and representative of the whole country.
He added: "I believe that I have proven myself to be independent and fair.
"I have ensured all MPs have been able to exercise their right to speak on behalf of constituents to hold the government to account - regardless of position or length of service."
Dame Eleanor Laing
Would you change Bercow's precedents?
Another MP who's been training for the top job for years is Dame Eleanor Laing, who has also been a deputy speaker since 2013.
She also joined parliament in 1997, as the Conservative MP for Epping Forest, and often steps in for Mr Bercow during debates.
Ms Laing recently told The House magazine there is "a lot to be done to take our democratic system onto the next stage" and claimed there needs to be "less testosterone and less aggression" at events such as Prime Minister's Questions.
Declaring her intention to stand to replace Mr Bercow, she paid tribute to her "friend" of 32 years who had "achieved an enormous amount".
"There will be a vigorous campaign to succeed him and I am happy to confirm I will be a candidate," she added.
Rosie Winterton
Image: Dame Rosie Winterton used to be Labour's chief whip
Completing the trio, the third of the Commons' three deputy speakers Dame Rosie Winterton is also running for a promotion.
She played an important role in Labour for six years as its chief whip from 2010, before being sacked by Jeremy Corbyn when he took over as leader.
Before then she was shadow leader of the Commons, so was well versed in its procedures, and served as a minister in numerous departments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's governments.
Dame Rosie was the "protegee" of former deputy prime minister John Prescott, according to The Times, and was his head of office until 1997 until she became the MP for Doncaster Central.
She has promised as speaker to unify the Commons and "achieve a fair balance between the rights of the Executive and the rights of parliament".
Sir Edward Leigh

A veteran backbencher, Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh has been in parliament since 1983.
Throughout his more than three decades' services, he only once held a junior ministerial role - for three years in the trade department under Sir John Major.
Sir Edward is well-known as an avid user of points of order to query parliamentary proceedings.
The committed Brexiteer told Sky News he is "strongly in favour of politicians keeping their word and letting everyone have their say".
"I will say firmly and strongly that parliament voted overwhelmingly to have this referendum," he said.
"Parliament cannot now stop it. When people talk about how terrible no-deal is, I agree with them.
"I voted for the deal three ties, but let's face it, many people in this parliament just want to block Brexit.
"We've got to be completely honest, avoid all the hypocrisy."
Chris Bryant
Image: Chris Bryant has published a biography of parliament
The Labour MP for Rhondda is a keen studier of parliamentary history, and is often in the Commons chamber for friendly exchanges on procedure with the current Speaker.
He is a former shadow leader of the Commons and has published a multi-volume biography of parliament.
Included in his pitch to MPs is to return PMQs to a 30-minute event (as Mr Bercow often allows it to drag on much closer to an hour); call MPs to speak in debates according to their relevance to issues rather than their seniority; and respect the rights of minority parties.
In a veiled reference to allegations against Mr Becrow, Mr Bryant has also promised to "make sure every single person who works in parliament is valued and respected and can do their work without fear of bullying, abuse or intimidation".
Mr Bercow has denied claims of bullying from his former staff.
Sir Henry Bellingham

Another long-serving MP is Sir Henry Bellingham, who came third in the election for deputy speaker back in 2013 - which Ms Laing ended up winning.
He was first elected to the Commons in 1983, but was kicked out by voters for four years at the 1997 election before winning his seat back.
Sir Henry has previously served as both a Conservative whip and Foreign Office minister.
"The Speaker himself, he should be like a really good referee, a really good umpire. He should never be the story," Sir Henry told Sky News when he announced his candidacy.
"I think it does need someone of experience, but also change of approach.
"The Speaker needs to push the boundaries, particularly at a time of national crisis.
"It's up to the Speaker to make sure parliament has the tools and ability to hold the executive to account at all times."
Meg Hillier
Image: Meg Hillier once forgot her ID card, on a visit to promote them
Labour MP Meg Hillier has made a name for herself as chair of the Commons' influential Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises government spending and the delivery of public services.
Under her, the committee has recently held inquiries on issues such as Crossrail, the BBC's pay policies, and the government's spend on consultants to prepare for Brexit.
She has served as MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005 and was previously a junior minister under former prime minister Gordon Brown.
Her time in government was marked by an embarrassing episode where she forgot her own identity card at a photocall to promote identity cards.
She blamed the mistake on the demands of looking after her baby.
Ms Hillier also served in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet as shadow energy and climate change secretary.
Prior to entering parliament, the former journalist was a local councillor, mayor of Islington and a member of the London Assembly.
Announcing her candidacy, she told the Hackney Gazette: "In these turbulent times, we need to defend our parliamentary democracy with ever-greater diligence and fortitude."
Shailesh Vara
Image: Shailesh Vara is a former Conservative Party vice-chair
Tory MP Shailesh Vara made headlines when he resigned as a Northern Ireland Office minister last autumn over Theresa May's Brexit deal.
He accused her of brokering an agreement which "does not provide for the United Kingdom being a sovereign, independent country leaving the shackles of the EU".
The North West Cambridgeshire MP had held a string of junior roles in other departments, including work and pensions, and justice, since his election to parliament in 2005.
He was also shadow deputy leader of the Commons for four years from 2006 to 2010, and a vice-chair of the Conservative Party from 2001 to 2005.
Among his promises if chosen as the next Speaker are to implement the report published last year into bullying and harassment, and create "more clarity" of existing rules to ensure the person in the role can not be "construed as not being completely impartial".

Story 144
Drawn by the growth story in Southeast Asia, corporate venture capital funds by unicorns as well as by foreign challengers are setting their sights in opportunities in Singapore.
When ride-hailing giant Grab considered how best to achieve its superapp ambitions, it set up Grab Ventures, a Corporate Venture Capital fund, to nurture startups in Southeast Asia through its seed accelerator programme, Velocity. In November 2018, Grab unveiled the first batch of startups which includes Indian online ticketing platform BookMyShow; Indonesian beauty appointment booking portal Minutes; German on-demand home cleaning platform Helpling; Indonesian on-demand marketplace for home renovation services Sejasa; and Singaporean edtech startup Tueetor.
Grab’s major rival, Go-Jek, earlier established its own CVC fund, Go-Ventures, to gain early access to technologies and innovations that could add value to its existing operations. Analysts expect the CVC trend to become a key industry theme in Southeast Asia, as the entry of more players creates only more opportunities for collaboration amongst firms seeking to leverage a unicorn’s formidable capabilities and a unicorn to quickly assimilate startups that pose a threat to their operations.
Overseas CVC funds are also becoming more active in fast-growing regions as investment opportunities in their domestic markets dry up, setting up the stage for stiffer competition and higher VC funding in 2019.
Unicorns hoard funding
Overall, VC investment activity into Singapore-based companies has increased, from US$1.34b in 2014 to US$4.92b in 2018, according to the Singapore Venture Capital & Private Equity Association (SVCA).
Source: PitchBook
A significant proportion of investment activity in Singapore last year was funnelled into unicorns, such as Grab, which received US$2.6b in funding and attracted two rounds of massive capital injections from Softbank Capital, Didi Chuxing and Alibaba Group, according to SVCA. “The Singapore VC scene is dominated by technological companies with the vast bulk of funds flowing to large firms with a dominant presence in the region,” a spokesperson from the association told Singapore Business Review.
Megadeals involving Grab with a total value of $7b pushed the aggregate value of VC deals in Singapore to increase by 500% as of the first quarter of 2019 to $8.697b from 2018, according to data from PitchBook.

This influx of large investments in unicorns led by Grab has accelerated activity in their CVCs, which when taken together with other alternative sources, as well as traditional sources like local VC funds, helped push total VC funding in the region to more than US$11b in 2018, noted Tan Yinglan, Founding Managing Partner at Insignia Ventures Partners.
Tan expects a new batch of companies valued at US$100m to emerge soon, as growth funds ramp up their investments in the region whilst global VC funds partner with active local VCs in backing earlier-stage companies. “This is a positive direction for the ecosystem here,” he reckoned, citing how the influx of funding towards larger Series A and Series B funding is creating a fresh batch of market leaders in key verticals like Fintech and logistics and closing the funding gap between Series B and Series C.
Also read: Are fintech startups hoarding capital?
Southeast Asia’s nine unicorns – which include Grab, Lazada, Razer and Sea Group and Go-Jek – raised US$16b out of the total US$24b funding from 2015 to the first half of 2018. “This trend will likely continue and extend towards companies in the US$100m club,” said Tan. “These companies raise on the back of potential growth in the region and entrench their leading positions through market or product segment expansion,” he added.
VC funding should continue to expand in 2019 with increased focus on Series B and Series C deals, with venture arms of unicorn companies like Grab, Go-Jek, as well as SEA and Lazada all becoming active in the early-stage ventures, according to Kiren Tanna, co-founder and MD of ZEN Rooms.
Source: PitchBook
Superapp challengers?
There has also been increased activity of overseas CVCs targeting specialised startups that have gone beyond the Grab and Go-Jek route, and 2018 saw “meaningful increases” in attention and capital commitments to Southeast Asia, especially from Korea, China, and even the US. “That is a positive indication of long-term sentiment.” Korean funds and firms, in particular, are looking at Southeast Asia to deploy capital to “participate in the growth story” and the trend will likely continue until 2020, said Tanna, pointing to Korea Investment Partners’ $120m fund with Golden Equator and Yanolja’s first cross-border investment in acquisition of stake in ZEN Rooms.
One sector that has also seen increased deals is logistics, which is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing verticals by VC financing in Southeast Asia, noted Justin Hall, partner at Golden Gate Ventures, in a development signalling possible roadblocks to the unicorns’ global ambitions.
“The previous wave of startups came from horizontal platform players like Go-Jek and Grab whilst the next wave of unicorns will be specialised vertical players which will become leaders dominating their own specific verticals,” said Tan, citing the US$60m Series B round by Carro, a company that offers an array of automotive services ranging from a used-car marketplace to after-sales and financing.
“One of the interesting things that we’ll see over the next few years and possibly quite soon is that some countries may not feel that comfortable having a foreign almost-monopoly player or an oligopolistic situation with a couple of players dominating the cashless transactions in their country,” Hugh Mason, co-founder and CEO of seed accelerator JFDI.Asia said in an earlier interview. “There comes a point when as a country, all the cash is going through a foreign system that knows more about its citizens than they do as a government.”
Regional powerhouse
Singapore stands at the forefront of increasing VC interest into Southeast Asia given its positive reputation as a location where companies can set up their regional headquarters. Analysts observed how foreign companies with sizeable war chests are increasingly making an intentional decision to expand into the region either directly or by teaming up with strategic partners, which was the case when Hong Kong-listed Ping An Good Doctor formed a joint venture with Grab to deliver healthcare services to the region.
“Singapore remains the headquarters of many VC funds in the region due to its friendly regulatory regime and international reputation, but regional operational presence is still key. A successful VC in Singapore is one which has ‘boots-on-the-ground’ in each local market,” said Tan. “It is essential for VC firms to build capabilities which allow it to mobilise local networks and resources to help regional startups tackle obstacles in their home market.” According to Chik Wai Chiew, Executive Director and CEO of Heritas Capital Management Pte Ltd, “the challenge is when seeking to scale, VCs in Singapore has to tap on the right regional partners to help the start-ups with localisation and market access.”
Outlook
For 2019, the SVCA said that regulatory changes, such as recent extensions for tax incentives and new investment flexibility for structuring of funds (for instance, the new Variable Capital Company (VCC) legal structure) may further encourage investment into Southeast Asia and for VC fund managers to operate out of Singapore.
However, Khor Qianyi, Senior Analyst and Head of ESG at Quest Ventures, warned that uncertainty around the new regulations, specifically the VCC, which was meant to increase VC activity in Singapore, poses a challenge for VC firms along with the lack of later-stage funding from Series B onwards.
Tan observed the widening disparity between startups with VC backing. “We are seeing smart money chasing top deals where mega rounds are getting larger. ‘A’ level startup with all-star founders are raising huge early stage fundraising rounds whilst growth stage market leaders are loading up on capital to entrench winning positions,” he said. “Whilst ‘B’ level startups attract funding from VCs which missed out on the ‘A’ level startups, the remaining startups find it hard to raise their next funding.”
“The industry, including technology media, needs to move away from associating large deals with large market implications,” according to Qianyi. “Whilst small deals do not sound exciting, it is important to track them when they are still starting up. As Jack Ma said, ‘Small guys become big guys.’”
Tan likewise warned that a “capital winter” could be in the cards if macroeconomic indicators worsen and capital markets stumble. “When that happens, companies which had been raising on vanity metrics could see funding dry up very quickly, as was the case with bike-sharing companies in China,” he said. “Companies will be judged by their fundamentals, and exceptional startups with solid metrics will continue to do well in their fundraising. Fundraising for the startup industry as a whole would get harder.”

How to speed up your Android tablet: Give your tablet a new lease of life!

Getting old sucks (we’re told). We slow down, simple tasks take a little longer and new generations threaten to take our place. Just like us, Android tablets can become less responsive as they get older. Maybe they take a few extra seconds to load an app or start stuttering and pausing more than they used to. The good news is with a few tweaks, we can give your tablet a new lease of life.
The reasons for this are pretty straightforward – tablets are designed to be left on for long periods, and over time their memories can become stuffed with unnecessary files. Or upgraded apps and operating systems can become more demanding users of space.
1. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
A quick restart of your Android tablet is the quickest way to clear cached data, close background apps and free up your tablet’s processor and RAM resources. Simply press and hold the power button until you see the options to Restart or Power Off. This is only a temporary fix, but if your tablet has been up and running for months on end without shutting down, chances are a restart may give it a little speed boost.
Related: Best Android Apps
2. Update Android
A more substantial fix is to check your tablet’s Android software is up-to date. Go to Settings > About > Software Update to see if there are any updates available as these will often come with new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes.
App updates are also worth downloading from the Google Play Store as developers are continually optimising and improving their apps.
3. Save Power
Now let’s figure out what apps or services are draining the most battery – but hang on what’s that got to do with speeding up our tablet? Go to Android Settings > Battery > Usage and if it turns out a particular app or game is using a lot of battery, chances are it’s using a fair amount of processor power too – so it may be worth uninstalling it.
Related: Best Android Tablets
4. Remove Pesky Widgets
One of the advantages of Android devices is their widgets. These can show information like the time and weather or provide app shortcuts, news feeds, and music players. Some will regularly update (such as weather widgets) and may use up a chunk of your tablet’s RAM and processing power – contributing to your tablet’s performance issues. Uninstall these from the Settings app to free up extra performance.
5. Shorter Animations
You probably don’t even notice, but every time you press the Home button or open the app drawer for example, you’ll see an animation like a crossfade or zoom. They may look nice, but they can make your device feel a bit on the slow side.
To reduce animation times, go to Settings > About and tap on ‘Build Number’ seven times to unlock Developer Mode. Don’t worry you don’t have to be a developer; anyone can do this! Go back to Settings and open Developer Mode, then scroll down until you see Window, Transition and Animator Duration Scale settings. Select each one and return the animation scale to .5x.
Related: Best Tablet
That’s it! Your tablet should feel quite a bit nipper now with shorter animations.
6. Faster SD Cards
If your tablet supports expandable storage in the form of MicroSD cards, it’s definitely worth investing in a better card with faster read and write speeds.
If you’re already using a card and you want to get a new one, make sure you back up your data first. The easiest way is to buy a USB card reader adaptor which plugs into a USB port on your laptop or computer. Plug the MicroSD card into the adaptor, open it the computer’s file explorer, and then copy and paste the contents to your desktop or a ‘backup’ folder. Reverse the process when you have your new card and simply pop it back into your tablet.
If you’re not sure which card to buy, you can’t go wrong with a Class 10 (guaranteed write speed of 10 MB/s) 32GB or 64GB capacity card from brands like Samsung, SanDisk, or Kingston.
7. Custom launchers
Nova and Google Now are two of the most popular launchers you can download and install from the Play Store onto your device. Launchers add what’s known as a ‘skin’ that changes things like animations, icon styles, and fonts. The changes may seem superficial, but depending on the launcher you install, they can have a big impact your tablet’s performance.

8. Clear Caches
As you use your device, data caches build up and can start to slow down the tablet’s software. Sometimes a good spring clean is in order so it’s a good idea to delete these caches every now and then. You can delete individual caches via the Apps menu in Settings or, more conveniently, use one of the popular (and free) apps such as Clean Master, CCleaner, and App Cache Cleaner which are available to download from the Google Play Store.
9. Rooting & Custom ROMS
Rooting your tablet and installing a custom ROM can speed up your device and give you access to hidden settings, including the ability to overlock your tablet’s processor and add or remove individual features. Be careful though, it’s a tricky process which has the potential to ‘brick’ your tablet as well as void its warranty.
There are a variety of tools and programs designed to help you root your device along with a range of custom ROMs available to download. However, most are designed for specific devices so it’s worth doing some research on how to safely root your tablet.
10. Factory reset
This step is for when all else fails and you think starting fresh is the best way forward. Back up your data first and then perform a factory reset by going to Settings > Backup and Reset > Factory Data Reset. After a few minutes you’ll be able to use your tablet again, good as new!

There were more than 300 vehicles to drive at CCIA from 26 manufacturers. Fleet News assembled a team of fleet managers from some of the country’s biggest fleets to help us assess some of the latest and most popular models at the event.
Who joined us?
Stewart Lightbody, head of fleet services at Anglian Water
Keith Cook, deputy financial controller at Computacenter
Paul Tate, commodity manager at Siemens
Vauxhall Insignia Grand Sport
Model Tested: 1.6 litre Turbo D EcoTec 110PS
Perhaps one of the most important cars at CCIA was the new Vauxhall Insignia. The old model was a big hit with corporate buyers and Vauxhall expects this model to achieve a 90% fleet mix.
We tried the most efficient model in the range, having already tested the 136PS and 170PS versions.
Stewart Lightbody commented that the engine felt underpowered and struggled on the more demanding sections of the hill route. However, on the high-speed bowl he thought the Insignia felt more at home cruising at motorway speeds.
The car emits 105g/km of CO2, which is high considering its status as the eco-champion. Vauxhall says this is because the car has been developed for the upcoming real-world driving tests, where it is expected to excel. Nonetheless it still returns an average of more than 70mpg if driven carefully.
“Cosmetically it’s a big step forward, but the interior isn’t a million miles away from that of the existing model,” said Lightbody.
Paul Tate added: “I like the interior but the air con controls are a bit fiddly and require you to press buttons and use the touchscreen – it’s just not intuitive.”
The new insignia is larger than before and Vauxhall have designed it to compete in a more premium arena. Despite this the list price is extremely competitive, with prices starting at £17,115.
In Tech Line trim the Vauxhall Insignia Grand Sport 1.6 Turbo D 110PS costs £21,025. It comes with front and rear parking sensors and sat-nav with OnStar connected services. Company car drivers will pay £967 per year in BIK tax and the car will cost 30.93 pence per mile to run over four years or 80,000 miles.
Volkswagen Golf
Model Tested: 1.0T SE NAV 110PS
Volkswagen introduced the new Golf at the beginning of the year and the facelift model is another excellent evolution of the one that went before it.
Once inside it’s a case of business as usual and anyone familiar with Golfs of the past should be able to get quickly acquainted.
There’s a brace of engines available including an ultra-frugal 1.6-litre diesel, but in this we test we opted for the new three cylinder 1.0-litre turbo petrol unit.
Keith Cook came back from his test drive and was staggered to find out it was powered by a 1.0-litre engine.
He said: “Having driven the 2.0TDI variant for the past few years I would say there wasn’t much difference between them. The performance and handling was excellent.”
Stewart Lightbody added: “The engine is a real delight and the exhaust note is more positive than in diesel versions. It engages people back into driving.”
There is real character to the way the three-cylinder delivers its power and all our fleet managers felt the 110PS output to be more than enough for the car. By ditching a heavy diesel engine the Golf feels light and nimble, offering a great driving experience.
The petrol-powered Golf becomes more interesting when you compare its running costs with the diesel equivalent. At £20,065 it’s £1,800 less than the 1.6 TDI in the same trim. It also saves the driver £200 per year in BIK tax, costing £800 for the 20% taxpayer. Running costs are lower, too, at 29.32 pence per mile versus the diesel at 30.26p.
Lightbody said he has been looking at the viability of petrol on fleet, as did Cook. Both conceded that the Golf 1.0T is a great example of how the industry could shift away from diesel in a cost-effective way.
Peugeot 3008
Model tested: 2.0 BlueHDI 150 GT Line
There was no shortage of crossovers to try at this year’s CCIA, the facelifted Nissan Qashqai made its UK debut along with big sellers such as the Seat Ateca, Kia Sportage and Ford Kuga.
We decided to give the Peugeot 3008 a try as is offers a more driver-focussed package than traditional SUVs in the same price bracket.
The 2.0-litre BlueHDI engine delivers 150PS and is combined with a nimble chassis and light body. Performance is strong but the 3008 is also frugal. It emits 114g/km of CO2 and manages to achieve 64.2mpg on the combined cycle.
Stewart Lightbody and Paul Tate both agreed that the 3008 has great styling but for Tate it was the seats that he found most impressive. The entire cabin is set up to feel like a sports car so the centre console sits high, cocooning the driver. Lightbody was less impressed and felt the gear lever was too high.
The oddest thing about the 3008 is its small steering wheel which is flat at the bottom and the top. It’s a bit like using a games console wheel. It does give excellent steering feel though, making the 3008 drive like a go-kart.
Tate likened the dash-mounted toggle switches to a piano, they do give a minimalistic feel to the interior but are not clearly marked and are used to control all the main functions such as radio, navigation and climate control.
The digital instruments won more praise and were likened to those in the latest Audis.
Our GT Line test car was priced at £29,030. It comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and a sports styling kit. BIK tax starts at £1,393 per year for a 20% taxpayer while running costs average out at 38.63 pence per mile over four years or 80,000 miles.
BMW 5 Series
Model tested: 530e iPerformance M Sport
The plug-in hybrid version of BMW’s newest 5 Series is the latest derivative to be launched. It uses a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine twinned with an electric motor.
Running on battery power alone, the car can achieve a range of around 30 miles but the real selling points of this car are its 9% BIK rate and combined power output of 250PS.
“I’m genuinely surprised by how good that is,” said Keith Cook. He added: “The driving experience is delightful.”
Stewart Lightbody confessed he isn’t a big BMW fan, but he was won over by the 530e.
“It’s effortless. Super quiet and super smooth,” he said.
Both fleet managers had concerns over the achievable fuel consumption though. BMW claim an average of 141mpg but it’s likely the realistic figure is closer to 40mpg for drivers who don’t use the battery range to its full potential.
“People will like the low benefit-in-kind rates but some, especially those with fully expensed fuel cards, are liable to abuse it,” warned Cook.
Lightbody added: “In the right hands it makes a lot of sense. I could definitely see some of our directors swapping out their 520ds for these.”
The 530e is extremely discreet about its hybrid status. The only visual giveaway is the charging point flap on the passenger side front wing. When you start the car it sets off in silent fully electric mode and can reach speeds of 87mph before needing to fire up the petrol engine.
Give the 530e a firm prod with your right foot from standstill and it can hit 60mph in just 6.2 seconds.
In sportier M Sport trim the 530e costs £47,230 but the Government will subsidise £2,500 of this through a grant. Its CO2 emissions of 46g/km mean BIK tax cost just £1,700 per year for a 40% taxpayer. However running costs are much higher. Over a four year cycle the 530e costs 60.48 pence per mile when a similar spec 520d will cost 47.02p.

Cards straight out on the table: the new Vauxhall Insignia Country Tourer might just be the best car Vauxhall makes.
Given it’s essentially a jacked-up wagon that can off-road without push coming to shove, that might come as a surprise – it did to us too. But the improvements Vauxhall’s made in facelifting the Insignia – and the way it all gels in the Audi Allroad-rivalling package – make the Country Tourer something of an unlikely hero among the largely vanilla Vauxhall range.
But it just looks like an Insignia Tourer with plastic wheelarches!
Is that such a bad thing? Vauxhall has been making a concerted effort to make its cars more ‘premium’ (whatever that means these days), and in the main, it’s not really been successful, when you compare them to the class best. But the sharper Insignia, with its angular new grilles and lights and handsome profile, wears its suit rather well.
Inject another 20mm of ride height, some blistered wheelarch armour, and chunkier 18in wheels and the Country Tourer starts to look, well, expensive. At £26,499 for this well-equipped 2.0-litre, 163bhp diesel model, it looks like a lot of car for the money. A similar Audi A4 Allroad would set you back £5000 more. Volvo’s old-but-talented XC70 has considerably more powerful engines, but it’s much pricier for it, kicking off at over £34,000.
But the Vauxhall’s still got that terrible button-peppered cabin, hasn’t it?
Not any more. Facelifted Insignias at last ditch the ugly, unintuitive button layout of recent Vauxhalls, swapping in a simplified climate control interface, and an 8in touchscreen. Don’t like prodding the display? You can also control the infotainment centre via a touchpad on the centre console.
Its sensitivity takes some getting used to (as does the alarmingly strong haptic feedback which sounds like muffled machine-gun fire), but give it some patience and it’s actually fairly usable. Much like the mouse-operated Lexus interface, in fact, which really isn’t as foul as some technophobes might have you believe.
What else is new inside?
A brilliant instrument display. It’s a crystal-clear screen that sits inbetween the physical rev counter and fuel gauge, and can switch between showing an analogue speedometer with inset navigation, audio playback or trip computer for instance. Or, the speedo can retreat to a smaller digital readout, leaving more space for the other functions. It’s all controlled via a re-thought button layout on the steering wheel, and it’s top-notch. Intuitive, clearly laid out, and expensive-looking. There are no gimmicky animations, just clear concise, attractive information. Well done Vauxhall.
So far so good. What about the powertrain?
You can choose from two four-cylinder turbodiesel engines and either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic gearbox. The brawny 192bhp ‘BiTurbo’ engine is only available as an auto, matched to all-wheel drive. We’re testing the other option: a 163bhp, single-turbo diesel good for 258lb ft from just 1750rpm, allied to a manual gearbox. Vauxhall claims that, in this all-wheel drive guise, it’ll return up to 50.4mpg, and bring up 62mph in 10.9sec.
It’s certainly better soundproofed than other Vauxhalls of late (including the Astra BiTurbo), but it does feel breathless: this is a near-1800kg car, and the ‘premium’ mask does slip a little when you’re being outpaced by three-cylinder city cars. Mind you, our test car averaged an honourable 41.9mpg, pointing to a mammoth 680-mile range.
All-wheel drive sounds like overkill, though…
Vauxhall argues that Britain’s recent winter weather justifies part-time all-wheel drive. Point taken – but what about the rest of the year, when you’re lugging around an extra 230kg versus a standard Insignia wagon?
Normally, the Country Tourer splits drive 95:5 between the front and rear wheels, which is enough to give strong traction and big grip in the bends. Opt for Sport mode (if you can reach the faraway dash-top button) and that tips to 70:30 front-to-rear, and adds more springiness to the steering. Good job that button’s out of reach then – it’s largely pointless. A ‘Tour’ mode relaxes the car to the point it feels narcoleptic, so isn’t worth playing with either.
Of more interest is the electronic rear differential. Vauxhall claims it sends power to the rear wheel with the most grip whether you’re on a slippery road or off the beaten track. Amusing though it sounds, being able to switch 95% of torque to the rear axle, this ain’t no drift-mobile – it’s just a comfortable family holdall with a lot more grip than its engine can trouble.
‘Sharp’ or ‘imperious’ are single words you might choose to describe the driving experience of certain cars. ‘Squidgy’ is the Country Tourer’s synonym. It’s no entertainer – the springy steering, wallowy gearchange and compliant ride are far too remote for those sorts of fun and games, but you won’t find us taking a Passat Alltrack or Audi A4 Allroad to a track day either. The Country Tourer is instead quiet, dignified, and jammed with kit.
Lots of toys?
More than Argos at Christmas. This ‘Nav’ trimline model comes with sat-nav (no surprise), DAB radio, front and rear parking sensors, heated front seats and s heated steering wheel, electric windows, part-electric seats, six airbags, heated door mirrors, privacy glass… you’d struggle to want for more.
It’s practical too: the cabin is a spacious and the boot holds up to 1530 litres, though the loading lip is so enormous it’ll look like you’ve backed a speedboat into B&Q’s car park. An automatic open/close tailgate is thrown in too, but it does like….to take… its…time.
Verdict
Whisper it, save word might get out, but the Country Tourer isn’t just the best Insignia – it really might be the most desirable, most rounded car Vauxhall makes. And the best news is – this is a mid-life facelift, with new styling and rationalised interior crowbarred in halfway through a car’s lifecycle. It bodes well for the next generation of all-new Vauxhalls which get this treatment from day one.

Vauxhall will launch a new generation of infotainment systems in Insignia models, later this year.
The new Multimedia and Multimedia Navi Pro infotainment systems are expected to be easier to use and will be rolled out across the Vauxhall model range in 2019.
Using an eight-inch high-resolution colour touchscreen and clearly-arranged Driver Information Cluster, the systems provide Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, with the ability to pair two phones simultaneously.
The top-level Multimedia Navi Pro introduces connected navigation services that optimise points of interest and destination searches, as well as Live Traffic, real-time fuel prices, parking information and online map updates.
Live Traffic pulls travel information from multiple sources when paired with a smartphone, allowing traffic flow and driving conditions to be updated in near real-time.
The new design of the Multimedia and Multimedia Navi Pro offers tablet-like controls and swipe-gestures.
The Multimedia Navi Pro infotainment system allows up to five drivers able to define their own profiles. The profiles allow users to save numerous adjustments from climate-control settings, to their preferred equalisation for the speaker system. Favourite destinations, playlists and points of interests are all stored according to the personalised profile, enabling the driver to concentrate on their journey.

There’s a lot going on in new solitaire/stealth mash-up, Card Thief. Sneaking isn’t as easy as you’d think, requiring plenty of careful thought and planning. While the game’s tutorial might teach you the very basics, there’s still plenty of other things to learn.
Gamezebo’s Card Thief Tips, Cheats and Strategies will provide you with the basic necessities meaning you’ll be dodging enemies and swiping treasure in no time.
The Basics
Take your time to make a move. There’s no rush and you want to get things right.
It’s important to know what each card means.
Barrels are going to be your favorite card. Land on one of these and your stealth is refreshed to 10. It’s perfect for giving you a substantial boost as you survive pursuing your stealthy path.
Besides that, feet give you a mini stealth boost so land on those when you can too.
Always focus on extinguishing the torches. Torches illuminate the area which means enemies end up even stronger. You should prioritize clearing them.
Work on keeping your stealth points as high as possible. It’s better to take out guards than simply swap places with them, after all.
Guards
Guards can only see you if they’re looking in your direction. Keep an eye on the direction they’re facing and plan accordingly.
See that eye icon up top? That means you’re being watched. It’s as vital as it sounds!
If you’re in the light with 0 or less stealth, and a guard sees you, it’s game over.
In a similar way, if you have more than 0 but the guard you sneak past reduces you to below 0, you’re still captured.
The best form of attack is defense sometimes.
You don’t actually have to take out all the guards. Most of the time, you want to focus on extinguishing the torches and picking up treasure. Clearing cards is everything rather than specifically dealing with the guards.
Guards will follow you if they get suspicious but they only ever move one space so it’s not the end of the world. Just be aware of how they react to you and respond accordingly.
Treasure
Don’t pick up the treasure chest straight away. Each turn that you don’t pick it up, the loot gets better. Wait it out and then pick it up at the last moment for maximum gains.
Don’t forget to use the treasure chest after a session. Hit the relevant icon and switch to the equipment page. Early on, you won’t actually have any equipment but you can open up the treasure chests and hopefully gain some loot.
Each chest holds either insignias or trash loot. Insignias go towards unlocking equipment but don’t expect to get too many.
There’s going to be a fair amount of playing before you unlock anything.
Save using your bonus extra stealth card until you really have to. It can get you out of a bind later on in your session, and can make all the difference.
Look forward to eventually unlocking equipment like the arrow that distracts the guards. The game opens up a lot more once you unlock new stuff like that.
Technical Tip

Story 158
At least four times in recent months, overzealous city crews have used paint or graffiti blasters to remove murals that turned out to be public works of art.
It won’t happen again if artists, organizations and property owners take the time to list their works of art on a citywide mural registry launched Monday and graffiti-removal crews remember to check that database before blasting away.
Artists and property owners can go to chicago.gov/muralregistry to see the registration criteria and complete an application.
Accepted murals will be assigned a “unique mural registration ID” and receive an official city emblem to prominently post on the work of art. There is no fee to have a mural listed; the database will be public.
Cultural Affairs and Special Events Commissioner Mark Kelly said public art is “very much a part of the spirit and quality of life” in Chicago neighborhoods.
RELATED:
• On second try, city OKs mural registry
• Mural registry stalls, despite mistakes by graffiti-removal crews
“Not only will the registry help protect these critical assets. It will also create a portal for the public to access and explore where murals are located in every corner of the city,” Kelly said in a news release.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel added: “This registry will strengthen Chicago’s legacy of public art and enable artists to share their work with the world.”
In repeated mistakes that embarrassed the city and infuriated local artists, city crews painted over or removed murals that turned out to be public works of art.
The latest mural mistakenly removed was the work of artist JC Rivera. It was painted over soon after it was completed near the Paulina station on the CTA’s Brown Line.
Similar mistakes removed murals in Hermosa, Wicker Park and at the North Side headquarters of Cards Against Humanity.
The registry was the brainchild of Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd), who had to overcome resistance from Ald. Ray Lopez (15th).
When Hopkins tried the first time to pass the registry, Lopez raised concerns about taxpayer liability and making certain graffiti removal remains a higher priority than preserving public art.
The second time was the charm, only after Hopkins modified the ordinance to alleviate both concerns.
The revised version made it clear that the city “has no additional exposure to any kind of litigation if we accidentally remove a mural that some artist believes was their property and they decide they want to sue us,” Hopkins said.
The final version further mandated that the “insignia for the registered artwork be a three-dimensional placard of some type that’s hard to counterfeit” and must be affixed “to a wall in such a way that it’s hard for the Streets and San crew to not notice it,” Hopkins said.

Credit: Epic Games
It's no secret that Fortnite: Battle Royale had some technical troubles yesterday: people were unable to play for the better part of the day, and that's a big deal when you're running one of the most popular games in the world. Developer Epic Games was able to get things back and running, even if there are some problems with party functionality right now. And as a way of apologizing, the developer has released a free piece of loot available to all players. In order to claim it your "Rust Bucket" backpack, all you need to do is head over to the item shop and hit purchase -- the price is 0 V-bucks. It does say that it's only there for a limited time, however, so move quickly.
If you're a Save the World player, you get a free Troll Stash Llama.
The Rust Bucket is a nice little cosmetic -- the little string of bullets give an otherwise junkyard-looking piece a bit of menace. Giving away free cosmetics or premium currency is not unheard of for games that experience extended technical issues -- the logic goes that it's theoretically free for the company, and valuable to the platers. It could even wind up making money for the developer if it hooks a few free-to-play players into the idea of character customization to the point where they decide to spend a few dollars completing a new look.
In this instance, however, I wouldn't be so sure that Epic isn't losing a good chunk of change for giving this item away. The key lies in the item description: this is part of the Storm Scavenger set, meaning that it goes with the Rust Lord skin and the Sawtooth Harvesting Tool from the Season 3 Battle Pass. I have to imagine that Epic was going to release it into the game fairly soon, and like the Orbital Glider before it, I'm sure it would sell pretty well. There's a real appeal that comes to having a complete, matching set in any situation like this, which is of course exactly why Epic kept these items out of the Battle Pass to begin with: what's a few bucks to have a coherent look?
Now, anyone who's already unlocked the rest of the Battle Pass can complete the look for free. It all comes out in the wash, but it feels like a reasonably generous gift. In the future, Rust Bucket will probably carry a little bit of different significance: a sort of "I was there" for the great login outage due to database failure of 2018.

Gearing up for a little online shopping?
You’ve probably already heard the holiday tales of phishers and hackers and scammers (oh, my!) who lurk in the corners of the World Wide Web.
But staying safe and secure on the Internet means following the same overarching rules you would to visit your local mall: Keep your wallet safe, don’t talk to strangers and stick to places you know and trust.
The good news: With a credit card, federal law limits your liability for fraud or unauthorized use to $50. And many card networks cut their customers’ liability to $0.
So after that, it’s just a matter of making it easier for you — and more difficult for thieves and con men — to use your cards.
Want to keep your cards and data as secure as possible while shopping online? Here are eight tips to help:
1. Be careful with those URLs.
Spammers know what they’re doing. Sites can look realistic right down to the (stolen) insignias that promise online safety and security.
But sometimes the best way to thwart them is just to go old school: When you want to visit a site to make a purchase, skip the links and carefully type in the address yourself, says Mari Frank, attorney and author of “The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Recovering from Identity Theft.” And double-check it before clicking — one mistyped letter could land you on an entirely different kind of site.
Essential reads, delivered weekly Subscribe to get the week’s most important news in your inbox every week.
One good reason to type it yourself: You can’t trust the links that you receive in an email (or from that great online forum) are genuine. Even bookmarks can occasionally be corrupted, says Frank.
Have a lot of sites to hit to compare prices? Use some of the well-known comparison-shopping sites, she says. That way you cover a lot of ground, don’t have to visit dozens of individual sites and you’re using the shopping sites to vet your e-stores, she says.
2. Stick to respected card issuers and vendors that treat you well.
If you’ve had your cards for awhile, you probably know which ones make things easy if there’s a problem, and which ones don’t.
Guess which one you reach for if you’re shopping online?
“It’s important to get a credit card that is not going to give you a hard time when you report fraud,” says Frank
Check out the site you where you want to make the purchases, too.
Jay Foley, principal partner for ID Theft Info Source, goes to a online search engine and looks up the name of the company and product. “I get the good and the bad so I can make an informed decision,” he says. “The second thing I like to do is check with the Better Business Bureau in the area where the company is located. Are they getting a lot of complaints: yes or no?”
And, “if I put in the name of company and product and don’t find anything on the Internet, I don’t buy,” he says.
That’s one of the advantages to our information age,” Foley says. “Information is at our fingertips. All we have to do is search.”
3. Actively seek security.
If the Web page where you check out and share your card information doesn’t have an address that begins with “https,” “it’s probably not safe to use a credit card,” says Peter Eckersley, technology projects director with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Other signs that signal the level of security you want for card use: a padlock or VeriSign insignia at the bottom of the page. Both indicate that the site is using encryption to protect your data, says Hillary Mendelsohn, author of “thepurplebook” series of shopping guides and founder of thepurplebook.com.
Depending on your browser and level of technical comfort, you can also use free software such as “No Script” (designed to block malicious script), and “HTTPS Everywhere” (which facilitates encryption between your computer and the websites where you shop), says Eckersley.
And if you’re using your card at a wider array of locations for holiday shopping, this is the time you want to use your card issuer’s online services to monitor that account. It takes only minutes, and if there are any unauthorized charges, you’ll spot them early.
4. Think twice about buying via WiFi.
When you’re buying, “don’t go wireless,” says Frank. Whenever you’re wireless, you’re exposed to more vulnerability.
That goes double for public WiFi hotspots, she says.
Another no-no for the security conscious: buying by cellphone, says Frank.
While it’s great for browsing and comparison-shopping, when it’s time for you to enter card digits and click “buy,” consider using a device with secure routers, or opt for land line phones, she says.
Other must-haves for computers you’re using for online shopping: a secure firewall and up-to-date anti-virus and anti-spyware software, she says.
Another smart avoid with card numbers and personal details: public and semi-public computers, where other people have regular access to the machines.
5. Understand what information sites need — and what they don’t.
If you’re buying something online, there are four things they should ask you for: the full credit card number, the expiration date and the three- or four-digit security code and, possibly, a shipping address, says Mendelsohn.
Don’t ever put your credit card number in an email. If the retailer did have a problem with your order, they’d ask you to call or return to the site. — Hillary Mendelsohn
Author, “thepurplebook” shopping guides
“There’s no situation where they should ask you for a Social Security number, the last four digits of a Social Security number or anything else,” she says.
If you later get an email claiming there’s been a problem with your order and requesting that you email your card number, treat it like the scam it probably is, she says. “Don’t ever put your credit card number in an email,” Mendelsohn warns. “If the retailer did have a problem with your order, they’d ask you to call or return to the site.”
Independently verify those phone numbers and website addresses. Especially at the holidays when phishing is rampant, you never want to use the contact information sent in an email.
6. Don’t store your card information on the website.
Obvious, maybe. But not always for the reasons you’d think.
Sure, you don’t want hackers to get your information and use it without your permission. But you also don’t want to make surfing and shopping too easy for teens, co-workers or anyone else who has access to your computer, says Linda Sherry, director of national priorities for Consumer Action.
Short-circuit this. When your computer asks if it should “remember” your site password automatically, the answer is “no.” You may have to uncheck a box to do this. Similarly, as you’re making a purchase, the site itself will likely ask if it should remember your card information for future purchases. Again: no.
The last thing you want: one-click shopping that includes access to the site, complete with your stored card information, says Sherry.
While it’s easy to prove unauthorized use if someone uses your card to buy airline tickets from Eastern Europe, it’s a lot harder to make a case if the offender orders a new gaming system and has it delivered directly to your home or office.
7. Avoid using debit cards online.
If you’re the victim of fraud or theft with a debit card, “the money is siphoned out of your account immediately,” says Frank. Depending on the bank, the money could remain in limbo during the subsequent fraud investigation, she says.
The other rub: “With debit cards, you’re not protected by the same laws that protect credit cards,” she says.
Even when online shopping involves using an intermediary, such as PayPal or BillMeLater, it’s smart to fund it with a credit card instead of a debit card just in case you have a dispute or problem, Mendelsohn advises.
8. Consider using a virtual or ‘disposable’ credit card number.
When are you using your card but not sharing your card number? When you’re using a virtual, temporary or one-time use card number.
Your card issuer gives you an alternate number to use when you checkout online. The disposable number still links to your account and your purchases will appear on your card bill.
But since the number is good for a limited time or with only one merchant, a scammer who comes across it later is less likely to be able to use it.
While disposable numbers are not available with every credit card, it’s something that a number of the major issuers are offering, says Steve Kenneally, vice president of the American Bankers Association.
Adds Kenneally, It’s “one more tool” for consumers to use to safeguard their card information when shopping online.

TouchArcade Rating:
Welcome to the TouchArcade Rangers of Oblivion guide. Created by NetEase and GTArcade, Rangers of Oblivion is a third-person action RPG designed to bring the gameplay of classics like Monster Hunter, God Eater, and Toukiden to the mobile front. Stuffed full of more traditional MMO quests, Rangers of Oblivion is something of a hybrid in the genre, mixing bewilderingly good mobile graphics with zone-based overworld combat and quests.
Veterans of the genre will feel well equipped in this world from the get-go, but newcomers are bound to feel a little out of their depth. This RoO guide should get new players off on the right foot while offering something of a tidy reference for even experienced players diving into the game for the first time.
Rangers of Oblivion – Getting Started
After a beefy download on the log-in page, you’ll be ushered in the character creator screen. There’s a slim chance this will be your first time with such a system, but it’s worth pointing out that the cosmetic choices you make here won’t affect your gameplay in any meaningful way. Just consider this a role-playing element. You’re free to choose between male and female characters and a plethora of hairstyles.
From there, you can select a face preset and/or dive into the more advanced tabs to tweak things like cheekbone, nose, and mouth however you like through the intricate slider system. Mess around with facial tattoos, body type, and voice, and you’re good to go. And don’t worry about getting everything right the first time, either; you’ll be able to edit your character to your hearts content through various mirrors available in-game (including one in a haunted house!).
Rangers of Oblivion – Graphics Options
Once the initial few cutscenes have played out and you’ve gained control of your character, it’s worth hopping into the in-game Settings page to tweak your gameplay experience a tad depending on your device. Whether you’re sensitive to framerates or not, Rangers of Oblivion is a fast-paced action game, meaning speedy reactions can go a long way. If your game is running at a choppy 15fps, you’re going to have a much harder time dodging lethal enemy attacks.
If you’re running on a relatively new flagship, you shouldn’t have too much trouble running Rangers of Oblivion on the max graphics setting – that is, by tapping the “ultra” button by Graphics Quality, setting Resolution to High, and Players Shown to “Many”. If you want to limit the number of annoying frame stutters occurring in quest hubs, opt for Few here instead. It seems most of these issues stem from other players popping in and out of few, and you won’t really need to see them anyway – they just help populate the world a little.
As you’ll notice on the meter beneath these options, the settings you choose are gauged on how much power they’ll draw from your device. Even if you don’t feel your game slowing down as you crank up the graphics settings, you’ll be demanding more from your device’s components, depleting its battery faster and even causing it to heat up to an uncomfortable degree.
Slide on down to the “System” tab and you’ll get a few additional options here. If you really want to have your game feel as smooth as possible, flick the High Frame Rate switch on this screen to shed the 30fps limiter enabled by default. You can even turn on Vibration to get a little force-feedback from in-game actions, or even set up a compatible controller if you have something like the GameVice, Steelseries Nimbus, or even just a third-party controller grip. All you need to do to enable controller mode is have one connected as you play the game, but your mileage may vary. The inputs listed on the Controller Guide found in this menu didn’t line up with those mapped to our Dualshock 4 controller connected to our Android device via Bluetooth, and you can’t remap the inputs in-game, either. If it works; great, if it doesn’t, it’s best not to dwell on it and just revert to the on-screen controls instead.
Rangers of Oblivion – Controls
Rangers of Oblivion uses a virtual joystick for movement. This is found on the left side of the screen and will reposition itself if your thumb lands in its general vicinity – though this can be changed to a fixed position through the System menu. Camera movement is handled by your right thumb, but is achieved simply by sliding basically anywhere else on the screen rather than relying on another virtual joystick clogging up the screen.
You can find your character info screen by tapping the icon in the top-left just above your quest log, with various menus like Mail, Inventory, Party, and the Notice Board taking up a few columns in the top-right by the mini-map. Just under that you’ll see your next available “Path to Greatness” task based on your current level. There’s even a small chat icon here for issuing pre-set callouts – though don’t ask us what the 666666 callout is for.
On the bottom right of the screen, you’ll find your Mount button and the Soul Eye activation button. The bottom center of the screen houses the game’s chat channel, leading us to the emote, camera, and screenshot functions shown by tapping on the small arrow in the bottom left of the screen.
Talking to NPCs is as simple as either tapping their body when you’re close enough, or tapping on the corresponding face icon that shows up at the same time. Rely on that if there’s too many other people around to get a clear shot at tapping their person.
You’ll lose access to a bunch of these buttons in combat, but your thumbs will really come into their own at that point. Your left thumb will focus on character movement via the joystick and tapping the Target Lock button to permanently fix the camera to a behemoth, freeing up your right thumb to execute attacks, evades, and Wild Soul actions via the on-screen prompts.
Rangers of Oblivion Best Weapons – What’s The Strongest Weapon Type?
Rangers of Oblivion uses a weapon system rather than classes; the weapon you equip controls the kinds of attacks you use. As is the norm with any class or equipment-based system, the one question newcomers always have is which of them is the strongest. Personally, I find the idea of picking the strongest option to be trivial; a player should choose whichever is the most fun for them. It’s far too early in the game’s life to say which weapon is the strongest or which is more valuable for a group of hunters, so we’ll just outline what each brings to the table down below to help you make a more informed decision.
Each of the abilities listed below are on top of the chosen weapon’s basic attack. Each ability can have certain aspects changed through Runes and upgrades available later in the game. The list below will only apply to the default ability set when equipping a weapon for the first time.
Staff – Ranged/AOE Elemental Dominion: Rains the elements down on and around your target. Elemental Destruction: Fires a concentrated beam of energy that pierces through targets. Arcane Barrage: Releases a barrage of magical missiles at the target. The amount is based on the available energy charged from other attacks.

Greatsword – Slow, heavy damage Blink Thrust: Teleport to your target and deliver to quick strikes Dragon Fang: Launch sword gales at your enemies that can strike from a distance Saintly Judgement: A powerful 2-stage charged smash

Lance – Defensive Shield Throw: Toss your shield for a mid-range attack Fearless Thrust: Charge at your target with your lance Avenging Barrier: Block and counter with your shield

Longbow – Ranged, Fast AOE Power Shot: Fire arrows that pierce their target Multishot: Fire arrows in a conal spread in front of you Rain of Arrows: Rain down arrows on the target area

Twin Blades – Sustained DPS Somersault: Jump up to attack from above. Blade Rush: Delivery a flurry of cuts to your target Last Rites: Attacks apply Blade Marks

Gauntlets – Sustained DPS Flickering Gale: Zip forward and deliver a blow upon hitting a target. Can be used 3 times within 5 seconds before going on cooldown. Each blow increases in power by 15% Flurry: Hold to deliver a dizzying amount of punches to the target Way of the Fist: Deliver a series of lightning-fast attacks to the target. You are invulnerable during this move.

Those who crave fast attacks and fluid combat will no doubt enjoy what the Twin Blades and Gauntlets have to offer. Just be prepared to dodge often. Longbow and Staff users will excel at striking multiple parts of a behemoth or quickly farming materials from other mobs from a safe distance. Lance offers up more attacking headroom thanks to its massive shield.
But it’s the Greatsword that will likely offer up the highest damage potential in the right hands. So if you were to ask which Rangers of Oblivion weapon does the most damage, we’d have to say Greatsword. But only when you know when and how to dodge.
Rangers of Oblivion – Combat Guide
No matter which weapon you choose, how you go about using your abilities in battle will remain the same. On top of the Normal Attack button where your right thumb would typically rest, you’ll notice 3 additional skill buttons around it. From left to right, these are first, second, and third abilities; imagine them as being in attack power ascending order. Tapping these skills will execute the desired attack, whereas certain others (usually ability 2) allow for longer attacks by holding the button down.
As you’ll be taught by the weapon instructor, you’ll typically want to Target Lock your enemy by tapping the padlock icon on the left side of the screen. This will free you up from having to reposition the camera during a fight. You’ll even have a button for cycling between available targets during a larger fight.
Unlike normal monsters farmed for materials, behemoths – the game’s bigger “boss” monsters – have exploitable weak points all over their body which can be identified by using the Soul Vision button to the left of your Dodge button. Not only do you deal increased damage by focusing your attacks on these glowing weak points, but they’ll eventually toppling the monster in question and allowing for a series of coordinated attacks as it lays there defenseless for a time.
A little later on in the game you’ll gain access to a Wild Soul. You’ll choose your initial Wild Soul based on the few additional abilities listed below, but at their core, these extra equips grant access to three additional abilities to use in combat. Accessible by holding the Wild Soul icon above your regular attacks, sliding and releasing your thumb over one of these pop-out abilities will activate them. The top one is basically always a heal with limited uses, but the first two can range from buffs and debuffs, to handy time stop effects and other neat little extras.
Rangers of Oblivion Best Wild Souls – Which Is The Best Wild Soul?
Just like the weapons in Rangers of Oblivion, you can’t single one Wild Soul out as the best. They’re situational and depend massively on the playstyle of the user. You’ll be presented with 5 of these Wild Souls to choose from early in the game, and while one of their skills is always a self-heal with limited uses, the other two vary greatly. We’ve rounded up the 5 beginner Wild Souls below with a bit of insight as to why each is great in their own way.
Light – Defense and Dispell Heal Team Shield Damage Boost vs Mutated

Nature – Healing and Endurance Heal Convert stamina into health Team heal over time

Mystic – Spheres and Time Manipulation Heal Cloaking field to hide from targets Freeze enemies in time

Shadow – Weaken and Status Effects Heal Increased damage to nearby targets Speed and power reduction to nearby targets

Titan – Raw power Heal Leech HP through damage Additional damage against controlled opponents

Both Nature and Light-type Wild Souls would suit those ready and willing to aid their team with situational heals, whereas Mystic and Shadow and more of a middle ground between damage and support. Titan, on the other hand, would be a fine choice for slower options like the Greatsword, allowing them to continue dealing more damage to regain lost health rather than continuously break their charged combos to avoid enemy damage. It’s not an option suitable for newcomers.
Just like abilities, the above options only relate to the initial Wild Souls offered to the player in the early hours of the game. Each class of Wild Soul have 6 different variants, meaning available skills can and will change as you unlock and exchange different Wild Souls or rank them up through training.
Rangers of Oblivion – Crafting and Gathering Guide
The main focus of a game like Rangers of Oblivion is to hunt big monsters and turn their spoils into weapons and armor capable of taking on the next big thing. You’ll spend a lot of your time picking out new equipment at Brokk’s blacksmith, but crafting them requires certain materials.
Tapping a material will, in most cases, tell you where you can gather them; but some will rely on the dreaded RNG more than others. Crafting new items will usually require behemoth parts like croaker scales and rhidon tusks, obviously obtained by beating the named behemoth, but other times you’ll have to procure more specific items like animal bones and ores.
To grab these less specific materials, you’ll want to talk to Cassandra at the Valley of Dawn gate and hit the Exploration button. This means you’ll go out in the field with no specific behemoth target in mind, so you’re free to gather from mineral veins and monsters without fear of a behemoth surprising you in a zone.
If you’re having trouble finding a certain material – like silver ore – you can trade any excess materials to Brokk for tokens used to buy your chosen material. Don’t expect a 1:1 ratio, however. You’ll need to work for those rare materials.

As an action-RPG clearly based on the best, Rangers of Oblivion isn’t a 100% single-player affair. It really can be if you want to go solo, but there are a few systems in place to no only aid those who’d rather go it alone, but a way to make things easier for those who aren’t quite able to defeat the game’s massive monsters without a little bit of help here and there.
Rangers of Oblivion – How To Invite To Party
You can easily partner up with like-minded players in Rangers of Oblivion by tapping their character icon in the overworld and hitting the “Invite to Party” option. If they accept, you’ll be able to chat to them by tapping the chat box on the bottom of the screen and selecting “Party” before typing out your message. Players in your party will show up in the Party window when you tap the Flag icon in the top right.
But if you’d rather drag some NPCs out into the wilderness to fight your battles, you’re free to do so. You’ll gain more NPC friends as you progress through the game and can even power them up by giving them appropriate gifts – as you’ll learn the with jam present early on. To invite them to your group, simply open up the party menu and tap one of the empty “reserved” slots. Once the NPC window opens up, just toggle the twin blade icon on your chosen NPC so that it glows. They’re now in your party and will help you out in any and all hunts you sign up for at the gate.

Queen Elizabeth's signed Christmas gift tags sell for almost $7,000 at auction
Sold! A collection of personal Christmas gift tags from Queen Elizabeth and her family went under the hammer at a London auction â and the handwritten notes give an insight about how the Royal Family exchanges presents. The Queen signed her tags "Mummy" to her four children Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, while using her nickname "Lilibet" for other relatives.

Gift tags signed by the Queen and other senior royals have sold for nearly $7,000: Getty Images
The tags are from Christmas cards, with some featuring the Windsor Castle insignia, and others featuring drawings of such seasonal characters as Elves.
One card has the phrase "Andrew, with love from Mummy" written on it, while the Queen signed "Lilibet" on two gift tags, including one for Nicholas, thought to refer to the Duke and Duchess of Kent's son Lord Nicholas Windsor. Lilibet was the name given to the Queen from a young age by her father King George VI.

The Queen's husband Prince Philip goes by "Papa" as demonstrated by one joint present for his two youngest sons, as one card read: "Andrew + Edward for a bouncing Christmas from Papa".
Prince Charles shows his funnier side in a gift tag for Princess Alexandra â the youngest granddaughter of King George V â and her late husband Angus Ogilvy. He signed the note: "Alexandra + Angus, with all love for a very happy, inebriated Christmas from Charles."

A former royal bodyguard apparently collected the gift tags and passed them onto his son-in-law. Although the royal aide refused to sell the collection himself during his lifetime, the seller believed that it is now time to part with the keepsakes.
Brian Reeve Auctions handled the sale, with the separate lots, bought by five different buyers, going for a total of nearly $7,000.

Titanfall is getting in-game currency but Respawn Entertainment swears black and blue the shooter won’t end up with microtransactions.
Titanfall is getting a Black Market where players can purchase Titan Insignia and Burn Card Packs.
Players shop for these items using credits, a new in-game currency earned by completing or winning matches, their first victory of the day, meeting daily challenges, selling burn cards and earning XP past level 50.
In a post on the Titanfall blog, designer David Shaver emphasised that credits earned in-game will be the only way players can purchase Black Market goods.
“With the introduction of an in-game currency, some may worry that the next step is that we will let players spend real-world money to get an edge in the game,” he wrote.
“We have stated several times that Titanfall will not have micro-transactions. Fear not, for we plan to keep that promise – NO MICROTRANSACTIONS! The only way to get Credits is by playing the game.”
The Black Market is available at level 11 and once you’ve opened the Burn Card menu, and is available after you regenerate. Details on Burn Cards and Titan Insignia follow; Respawn said it’s also considering adding other items to the Black Market but can’t give details yet.
Titan Insignias
The Black Market introduces a set of Titan Insignias that are themed as the official insignias of elite units on both the IMC and Militia. Once you unlock them in the Black Market, they will be available with the rest of your Titan Insignias in the Titan Custom Loadout screens.
Burn Cards
Burn Card Packs contain a random Burn Cards each focused on a specific theme. They let you choose the type of Burn Cards you like to use. Need an XP boost? Buy the Time Boost Pack. Just need a few cards for the next match? Grab a Standard Pack which can contain any card in the game.
The primary goal of Burn Card packs is to give you more choice in the kinds of Burn Cards you get and to fit different play styles. The Cards you get are random, but you get a set of Cards you know you will enjoy using. Do you like using Ordnance more than Tactical Abilities? Sell the Ability Cards for Credits and buy an Ordnance Pack.
Thanks, GameInformer.

The Best Nintendo Switch Accessories 2019
Facebook Twitter Email
Are you the new owner of a Nintendo Switch? Or maybe you’ve owned one for a while but aren’t sure which accessories are out there that can enhance your experience? Well not to worry as we got your back and have several recommendations for that Switch in your hand.
Check out these suggestions, we’re sure we’ve covered all the bases here.
amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Nintendo Switch
Available at Amazon
Price: $9.99
We reviewed this here.
No one wants to see their Nintendo Switch screens gets scratched. And let’s face it, not only can the official dock do the deed, but so can dropping random things on the screen. Or placing the Switch upside down, having little children accidentally drop it on the ground or worse. Thankfully, there are ways to protect it, legal ways. Such as the amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector. Just as the name implies, these screens are made of tough, tempered glass, that will take all the damage originally meant for your screen. If you don’t have a screen protector, we highly recommended these. Plus as a bonus, for the price of one, you’ll score two screen protectors.
Seriously folks, if you get one item on this list. Make it this.
Nintendo Switch Pro Controller
Available at Amazon
Price: $69.99
We reviewed this here.
For those who want a more traditional gaming experience with their Nintendo Switch, we recommend the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. Sure, it looks like an Xbox One controller, but is that really a bad thing? You get all the buttons and triggers you need to take it to any Switch game, all with some extra comfort. It’s also cordless, so you can sit quite a distance from the Switch and has amazing battery life. Having an actual D-Pad is also a plus, especially if you aren’t a fan of the Joy-Con’s button D-Pad wannabe. It also incorporates Gyro-aiming, so really don’t miss out here.
The downside? These things aren’t cheap and cost as much as a Joy-Con. But I feel the price is more than worth it.
Orzly Screen Cover Stand
Available at Amazon
Price: $11.99
It’s a screen cover, it’s a stand and it does both of those tasks really well. There’s nothing more I need to say, right?
Oh, ok. It has 3 different positions when it is used as a stand. It also doesn’t block any of the ports, connections or the power button. The front of the cover can also have decals/stickers or even custom art placed on it as well (That’s not part of the official offering).
Useful for those who take their Switches out of the safety of their homes. Don’t leave home without this.
8Bitdo SN30 Pro Controller
Available at Amazon
Price: $49.99
8Bitdo has been making quality controllers for a very long time. While this controller isn’t made exclusively for the Switch, the fact that it’s a very affordable Bluetooth controller and one that also looks like a Super Nintendo controller. It also works on the PC as well, in case you don’t actually own a Switch.
Fans of the retro scene have raved about this controller and for good reason.
Officially Licensed Nintendo Switch Dock
Link:
Price: $89.99
Let’s face it, everyone needs a spare Switch dock. While the Switch is a portable(ish) device, we all love docking so we can charge it and play on a bigger screen. And sometimes we like taking it into our living rooms, family rooms, even our bedrooms for some quality time. Meaning we’ll need an extra dock or two unless you like unplugging your existing dock and moving it about.
The downside to this? The original Nintendo Switch dock is quite pricey, and for many is the only dock they trust. However, if this is too pricey for you, check out the next item on the list.
Insignia Nintendo Switch Dock
Available at Best Buy
Price: $39.99
What’s this? A Nintendo Switch dock, but one that’s not officially endorsed by Nintendo? How dare we add this to the list? Well, to be honest, this is not only one of the cheapest Switch docks. It also includes all the ports and connections that the official does. It’s also 100% compatible with the Switch, so it won’t brick your system. I trusted it so much after doing my research that I purchased one for my family room. Even after the Switch 5.0.0 update, this dock is still running with zero issues. But don’t believe me, do your own research. There’s not a single report of this particular dock bricking any Nintendo Switches.
AmazonBasics Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch
Available at Amazon
Price: $13.99
Take your Switch on the road with you often? If so, this case should be something already own, but if you don’t, here you go. Similar to the official Switch carrying case, this Amazon version is a few dollars cheaper. Has space for the Switch with Joy-Cons attached, a spare set of Joy-Cons, charger, a combination of Switch carts and memory cards and extra cables. It’s also a hardshell case, so your precious Switch will be protected to an extent.
AmazonBasics USB 3.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
Available at Amazon
Price $13.99
Yes, I’m quite aware that Nintendo has an officially licensed LAN adaptor. Yet, I’m here to tell you that there are alternatives to this, like this one from Amazon. Not only does it work just as well, I know as I’ve tested it on both of Switches. It’s also cheaper, coming in at $13.99. You also don’t have to worry about any issues such as bricking as it uses the same USB standard as everything else.
Perfect for playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or getting some late night Splatoon 2 games in.
PowerA Joy-Con and Pro Controller Charging Dock
Available at Amazon
Price: $14.99
I personally love this charger. Able to charge both an extra Joy-Con (L/R), as well as a pro controller at the same time. It’s very affordable and does what it needs to do extremely well. The only issue I have with this is the dongle that connects to the pro controller is prone to coming off easily. Still, you won’t find a better charging solution that does what this does.
PowerA Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Charging Dock
Available at Amazon
Price: $29.99
If you don’t own a pro controller but do happen to have a couple of Joy-Cons, then this charger might be more your speed. Able to change a 2x pairs of Joy-Cons at once, and features LEDs on the top that let you know when the Joy-Con has been completely charged.
SanDisk Ultra 400GB microSDXC UHS-I card
Available at Amazon
Price: $71.99
Thanks to the Switch not having a very large storage capacity, we need to rely on microSD cards. That said, I’ve noticed that several of my associates tend to go for the cheaper no-name brand cards and either complain about performance or come crying when they end up losing their stored content. Never cheap out on microSD cards, of you’ll find out the hard way I always tell them. As such, I recommend this 400GB microSD card from SanDisk. Known for their amazing performance and great storage, SanDisk always highly recommended. Even if they are a bit pricey. Still, for 400GB, your storage issues will be handled for a very long time.
Or you could wait for the 1TB versions that will be released around April 2019.

Story 165
Credit: Turtle Beach
These days, I casually dabble in online multiplayer, but rewind ten or fifteen years and you’d see a totally different kind of gamer. I cut my teeth on network play with the Dreamcast, placing laggy arrow tiles in Chu Chu Rocket and sending choppy, five second voice clips over 56K in Alien Front Online. Soon thereafter, I graduated to Xbox Live on the original Xbox, with its fancy broadband propensities and newfangled Gamertags. I had a blast, honestly, but something happened in the years following, a creeping distaste for the online scene that started to push me away. Maybe it was the trash-talking 10-year-olds. Or maybe I’m just really bad at first person shooters.
Regardless, I still keep my eye out for innovative hardware that centers around online multiplayer, so trying out Turtle Beach’s new Recon Chat headset was a no-brainer. The budget-conscious communication device retails for $19.99 and is out now in the UK, with a US release to follow mid-May (pre-orders available now). It falls under the Ear Force brand, which many of you may be familiar with. I actually owned and quite enjoyed a pair of the wireless X41s years ago, and even rocked a pair of X42s for a short time. Granted, those were high-end headphones, but there's definitely an assumed quality.
Credit: Turtle Beach
But before we get into impressions, let's talk features. As far as basic sound goes, the Recon Chat has a single earpiece This is probably by design, as the product seems built around chatting with online friends while still being able to hear extraneous audio. Basically, one ear remains completely free for outside listening while the other ear can hear the Recon Chat speaker as well as outside sound. How so? The earpiece itself is slotted by way of perforated plastic. These numerous, tiny holes allow exterior noise to pass both through the unit, effortlessly moving around the speaker.
This obviously cuts down on immersion, but all-encompassing audio isn’t what the Recon Chat is going for—the focus here is, at least from my perspective, a more heightened awareness of one’s immediate surroundings. It’s an interesting intermediate between full-on headphones and just using your default television speakers for audio. And honestly, the sound quality isn’t half bad. I wouldn’t exactly recommend using this set for VR or other massively engrossing single player experiences, but the basic audio is crisp, clear and perfectly practical.
Credit: Turtle Beach
The chat mic is bendable, stays out the way for the most part, and has a mute switch on the in-line controls. Also on the in-line unit is a speaker volume wheel that adjusts what’s coming out of the earpiece. The Recon Chat uses a 3.5mm wired jack, so its relatively universal when it comes to compatibility. On that note, even though there is both a PS4 and an Xbox One themed Recon Chat (blue and green, respectively), Turtle Beach assures me that both sets are essentially identical and can be used with either console, as well as countless mobile devices.
And what about comfort? The headband itself is made of flexible plastic and outfitted with several glued-on pieces of no-frills foam, and protruding from the earpiece are several pieces of fluffy fabric that rest gently against the side of your face. Nothing fancy here, but it gets the job done. Also, the headband is easily reversible, so you can wear the speaker over either ear. Admittedly a nice addition if you have a particular preference, or if your ear is getting fatigued and you want to switch things up.
Credit: Turtle Beach
And speaking of amenities, the Recon Chat smartly accounts for the bespectacled. I feel like glasses-related comfort is often overlooked in headsets, but luckily in this product, Turtle Beach makes up for the usual omission. The earcup has a molded pass-through for glasses rims and works beautifully to prevent undue pressure on the temples or the ears. It’s such a simple detail, but one of those features you don’t realize you’ve been missing until you try it.
I was able to test out the Recon Chat during a modest Overwatch session, and I must say that I’m quite impressed, especially for a $20 headset. The headband remained mostly comfortable for the majority of my two hour losing—er, having fun—streak, only starting to feel tight toward the end of that time period. Chat audio was clear, and I was told by my brother (who was doing much better than me in the endgame statistics, mind you) that my voice was sharp, discernible and free from static or other audio artifacts. Seems like a win.
Credit: Turtle Beach
All in all, I’d say that if you’re in the market for a relatively cheap chat headset, maybe to replace the standard fare that ships with most game consoles, you could do a whole lot worse than the Recon Chat. It nicely fills a specific online chatting niche and works well if you want to simultaneously hear chat and game audio through your television or home theater system, or even just want to keep your senses open to other noise in the room. I can imagine this solution working brilliantly during social online mutliplayer, letting people in the room (i.e. significant others, children, interested company) also experience the on-screen action while you get on with playing and chatting.
Now if only the Recon Chat could help me get better at Overwatch...

Expanding the breadth of the Opel Insignia sedan, General Motors says it will show an Insignia “sport tourer” or wagon at the 2008 Paris auto show in October.
Like the sedan, the wagon shows the next generation of Opel design—which by extension is the new look of Saturn in North America. The Insignia sedan will be sold in the U.S. as the 2010 Saturn Aura and North America may also get a hatchback Aura.
The Insignia wagon goes on sale in Europe in the spring of 2009—but we do not expect a Saturn wagon to come here. GM already has the Cadillac CTS wagon for the U.S., which will test the waters for a segment that is about 250,000 units strong in Europe, but is only about 30,000 or 35,000 vehicles in the U.S.
The styling goal of the new Insignia is bold, dynamic, and crisp. The signature of sorts is the blade line sweeping the sides and a wraparound look around the tailgate as well as inside the cockpit.

Star Trek is coming back to television in a big way this fall with an all new series coming to CBS All Access. Since San Diego Comic-Con is full of the kind of nerds who are looking forward to exploring the final frontier, it should come as no surprise that Star Trek: Discovery has a big presence at Comic-Con.
Not only is there a panel here at the convention, but CBS All Access also put together a little Star Trek: Discovery exhibition full of props, costumes and artwork of the new ships that fans will see when the new series begins this fall. Lucky for you, we got a closer look at everything on display, which includes tons of new information about the show’s characters and much more.
Check out all of our images from the Star Trek Discovery Comic-Con exhibit below.
Because we have so many images from the exhibition with detailed information for each one, we’ve separated everything we saw into three categories across three pages. All of the text information with each item was provided by information cards at the exhibit.
Let’s begin with some images showing off the new Starfleet gear from Star Trek: Discovery:
Starfleet Communicator, Tricorder and Insignia Badges
Standard issue by Starfleet Command for away missions, the communicator design is heavily influenced by the communications from the original Star Trek and is made from milled aluminum.
The tricorder is for scanning and recording data on away missions. It was built and painted in Los Angeles and its screen employs the use of a smart phone with video looping images and includes a removable hand-held scanner. It was made entirely with a 3D printer.
The Starfleet insignia badges were made to match the trim of the uniforms and are matched to Starfleet divisions: command (gold), sciences and medical (silver), and operations (copper). The gold, copper, and silver badges were made in Toronto by making wax models from 3D prints, then creating plaster molds for silicon bronze to be poured into. The bronze badges are then polished and plated by a jeweler to create the custom colors for Discovery.
Starfleet Phaser Pulse Rifle and Hand Phaser
Standard issue by Starfleet Command, the pulse rifle is inspired by the Pup rifle designs of today. The pulse rifle has one nod to the Star Trek: The Original Series phaser rifle that observant fans will notice and that is the orange foil chamber within the barrel. The pulse rifle was built in Los Angeles and is almost entirely 3D printed.
The hand phaser is reminiscent of the original series phaser, but the design was given a tougher look to indicate more militaristic functionality. The phaser was built and painted in Los Angeles and is 3D printed with removable magazine that houses the batteries and electronics.
Starfleet Long Haul Space Suit
The Starfleet Long Haul EV suit was built in the UK. It was milled from high-density foam as one unit and then draped in fiberglass. The suit was then sectioned into pieces that fit as a clamshell over the actor’s body. The optically clear lens of extruded plastic were made from a 3D scan of the helmet and had to be perfect to fit the suit’s frame. This is the suit that we see Sonequa Martin-Green wearing in space from the Star Trek: Discovery trailer.
Starfleet Tactical Jumpsuit & Vest
Starfleet officers engaged in combat situations or potentially hazardous away missions are issued an armored tactical vest and distinctive version of the duty uniform, trading metallic accents for a low-profile navy compression panel. Laser flashlights are installed in the shoulders of the vests for guidance. Vests also contain additional functional elements for attaching specialized mission gear.
Starfleet Duty Uniform, Operations Division
This is a variant duty uniform worn by Starfleet officers that features elbow-length sleeves and alternate detailing. The copper side compression panels and delta shield pattern signifies an officer in Starfleet’s operations division, which encapsulates ship operations, security, and engineering functions. The fabric for the Starfleet duty uniforms is dyed a custom navy blue in Switzerland, then cut and built in Toronto by the costume team under the direction of costume designer Gersha Phillips.
Starfleet Medical Officer Duty Uniform
Medical officers wear hospital white variants of Starfleet science division uniforms. The silver side compression panels and delta shield pattern signifies medical’s place within the science division, but are marked by a distinctive badge insignia.
Starfleet Duty Uniform, Sciences Division
This is a standard Starfleet duty uniform typical of those worn by Lieutenant Commander Saru (Doug Jones) on the USS Shenzhou and Lieutenant Paul Stamets (Anthony Rapp) aboard the USS Discovery. The silver side compression panes and delta shield pattern signifies an officer in Starfleet’s sciences division.
Starfleet Duty Uniform, Command Division
This two-piece Starfleet duty uniform is worn by First Officer Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) aboard the USS Shenzhou. The gold side compression panels and delta shield pattern signifies an officer in Starfleet’s command division, as does the command star insignia on the Starfleet badge.
Starfleet Captains Duty Uniform, Command Division
This two-piece Starfleet captains uniform is worn by Captain Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) of the USS Shenzhou. The gold side compression panels and delta shield pattern signifies an officer in the command division of Starfleet. The additional gold detailing on the shoulder epaulets is what signifies the rank of Captain.
On the next page, we’ll look at what the Klingons are wearing and wielding, as well as some other items.

When Android Pay was re-branded as Google Pay, the mobile app lost a small (but important) feature - the ability to sort cards. If you only have one or two cards in Google Pay, you probably won't care, but it's nice for people with several payment methods and loyalty cards.
Thankfully, a recent update to the Pay app has fixed this problem. The ability to re-arrange cards seems to have been added in Google Pay 1.57, released a little over a month ago. So while it's not new, you might have missed it, especially since the card telling you about it could be near the bottom of the main page (like it is for me).

New-look Oceania
Oceania Regatta and Oceania Insignia are among the record number of overseas ships heading our way for the summer cruise season. Regatta arrives in Sydney on December 13, kicking off its biggest season based in local waters – the boutique, 684-passenger ship will sail eight cruises to Bali, New Zealand and around Australia between December and March. Itineraries range from 14 to 19 days and less-visited ports of call include Exmouth, Geraldton, Busselton and Albany in Western Australia; Burnie in Tasmania; Geelong in Victoria; and Eden in NSW.
Regatta's sister Insignia, which is the first of the four smaller ships in the Oceania fleet to undergo a dramatic redesign in the company's OceaniaNEXT "re-inspiration" program, will leave Los Angeles on January 30 on a 32-day cruise that finishes in Sydney on March 4. It departs the same day for a 27-day cruise to Tokyo that calls at Brisbane, Cairns, Cooktown and Darwin before crossing the Timor Sea for Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Japan.
As Insignia is due for its makeover in early December, guests on these near-to-home cruises will be among the first to experience the benefits of new staterooms and suites and beautifully redesigned restaurants, lounges, bars and public spaces.
Oceania is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year and the line's president and CEO, Bob Binder, is understandably excited about the OceaniaNEXT program. "Our Regatta-Class ships are like second homes to our loyal guests and travel partners," Binder said. "They don't build ships like these anymore, which is why this re-inspiration project is such an important milestone in our company's 15-year history.
"We are maintaining the intimate surroundings and personal attention that our guests love, while at the same time setting a new standard of style and elegance for small ship cruising."
The numbers are certainly impressive: Oceania is spending $US100 million on the four R-class ships, which will involve more than 1000 craftspeople and artisans. All up, the ships will receive 1368 new suites and staterooms, 1400 new marble bathrooms, 8000 new light fixtures and 12,000 new sofas and chairs.
Oceania Marina and Riviera, the line's matching 1250-guest ships, are also in line for the luxury treatment. Their spacious, 185-square-metre Owner's Suites (six on each ship) will be stripped down and redecorated and refurnished entirely with products from the uber-stylish Ralph Lauren Home Collection.
Meanwhile, bookings have just opened for Oceania's new "Europe & The Americas" 2020 itineraries. By then, all four R-class ships will be sporting their $US100-million new looks and Marina and Riviera will have had more, yet to be revealed, enhancements. See oceaniacruises.com.

THE PORT Budapest, Hungary

WHO GOES THERE APT, Avalon, Crystal, Evergreen/Emerald Waterways, Riviera, Scenic, Tauck, Travelmarvel, Uniworld, Viking.
WHY WE LOVE IT Hungary's astoundingly beautiful capital is divided by the Danube, with Buda on the west bank and Pest on the east bank. The imposing Chain Bridge between Buda and Pest was built in 1849 and the two distinct areas officially became one city in 1873. Buda is the quieter, hilly side, home to the Royal Palace and the cobblestone streets and medieval houses of the Castle Hill district; Pest is the lively city centre, dominated by the grand riverfront Parliament building and packed with historic sites, cool bars and restaurants.
TAKE A TOUR OR GO IT ALONE? Ships usually dock on the Buda side, within walking distance of Castle Hill, or you can take a funicular to the top. Free walking tours of Buda and Pest operate daily (see the website below), as well as locally organised cycling, Segway and hop-on, hop-off bus tours. It's worth taking at least one guided tour as there is so much to see; another option is to buy a Budapest Card for 24 to 96 hours' worth of independent sightseeing by public transport. An evening scenic cruise is almost mandatory.
MUST SEE On the Buda side: Ottoman-era thermal baths at the foot of Gellert Hill; Fisherman's Bastion, for the views; Buda Castle and its museums; Hospital in the Rock, beneath the castle; and the 14th-century Matthias Church. On the Pest side: St Stephen Basilica; Szechenyi Baths; Dohany Street Synagogue, the biggest in Europe; 19th-century Great Market Hall; and ruin pubs in the seventh and eighth districts.
MUST EAT Goulash is Hungary's best-known national dish – most know it as a spicy beef, tomato, capsicum and paprika stew but the authentic version is more like a soup. Other savoury dishes to try include stuffed cabbage rolls; langos, deep-fried flatbread snacks served with sour cream and grated cheese; and all types of local sausage (kolbasz). Chimney cakes dusted with cinnamon or ground nuts are a popular sweet treat, especially at the Christmas markets.
NEED TO KNOW Although Hungary is part of the European Union its currency is the forint. Most big shops and restaurants accept credit cards but take some forint cash for taxis and street stalls.

More ships for Silversea
Silversea and Royal Caribbean have ordered three new ships for Silversea – that's on top of the 596-passenger Silver Moon and Silver Dawn, which are being built in Italy and due to join the luxury fleet in 2020 and 2021. Silver Origin, originally ordered as a sister ship to the new Celebrity Flora, will start cruising in the Galapagos in 2020, and the first of Silversea's two new Evolution-class ships is scheduled to arrive in 2022. No details have been released about the Evolution ships, but Richard D. Fain, chairman and CEO of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, said, "There is tremendous potential in the ultra-luxury and expedition markets of the cruise industry, and we believe discerning travellers will embrace the exciting designs Silversea is imagining for them." See silversea.com.
Luxury Down Under
Among the record number of luxury ships sailing in local waters this season is Crystal Cruises' newly refurbished Crystal Serenity. Crystal is spending millions on redesigning the ship's suites, restaurants and public spaces and the elegant grand dame will accommodate 980 guests rather than just over 1000 when it emerges from its three-week dry dock next month. As the crew numbers remain the same, Crystal Serenity will boast an even higher crew to guest ratio than before. There is still limited availability for Crystal Serenity's 15-day voyage from Auckland to Perth, departing on February 5, 2019. The ship will spend two days in Sydney before heading to Hobart for an overnight stay, then make maiden calls to South Australia's Kangaroo Island and Western Australia's Busselton.

Story 171
By Darrin Kozlowski, as told to Mike Kessler
On and off for almost 20 years, I investigated and infiltrated outlaw motorcycle gangs as an agent for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. I wasnât the only agent to go deep undercover, and I donât claim to be the best. But the work I did took a lot of bad guys off the streets. I infiltrated the Warlocks in West Virginia in a case that took me up and down the East CoastâFlorida, South Carolina, Brooklyn, the Bronxâand resulted in 57 federal arrests (including four Hells Angels) and 49 search warrants executed in six states that turned up 175 firearms (including two sawed-of shotguns and one machine gun), one silencer, one pipe bomb, and body armor.
Here in L.A., I infiltrated the Mongols for three years on what was ATFâs most successful undercover case to date and remains the largest single enforcement operation weâve done. We prosecuted more than 100 members of the Mongols on weapons and drug charges; 79 of those members were hit with RICO charges, too.
Through all these cases, I came to learn what itâs like to be inside the heads of the guys who ride with outlaw motorcycle gangsâtheir mentality, their conversations, how they perceive the public and their enemies, and their lack of regard for law enforcement and for innocent lives when thereâs a confrontation. Like in Laughlin, Nevada, in 2002, when the Mongols and Hells Angels opened fire on each other in a casino, or the 2015 Twin Peaks restaurant shoot-out between the Bandidos and Cossacks in Waco, Texas.
Even though Iâm retired, thereâs a lot I still canât sayâpartly for my own safety and partly because it would be potentially dangerous for other agents. But thereâs one case I can talk about: my infiltration of the Vagos in L.A. back in 1997. It was my first long-term undercover caseâin Los Angeles or anywhereâand it nearly got me killed.
The Vagos were as bad as outlaw motorcycle gangs gotâright up there with other âone-percenterâ gangs like the Hells Angels and the Mongols. If you look closely at the patches on their jackets, youâll see a diamond with â1%â in the middle. Thatâs their way of saying they donât live like the rest of us. Some of these guys had rap sheets as long as a traffic jam on the 101. Weâre talking about drug running, illegal weapons sales, and any other moneymaking schemes. Of course, they never refer to themselves as âgangs,â and they might have some regular guys as members. Some even hand out toys at Christmas. But thatâs to enhance their public image. That diamond is there for a reason. The Vagos had hundreds of members and dozens of chapters, stretching across the country and into Mexico. And they were growing fast. Thatâs the outlaw motorcycle gang way: Recruit, grow, and take over more territory by any means necessary. These are the same dudes whoâd one day kill a Hells Angel in public up in Reno, and then murder someone else in public in Bakersfield. We wanted to go deep and pull them out by the root.
FALSE START
I donât know what surprised me more, that Junior had been killed or that his girlfriend knew who I was. Iâd never met the womanâdidnât even know her name, and, to my knowledge, she didnât have mine. Iâd been cultivating her boyfriend as an informant when he got run down by a car on Sunset. He was riding a Harley Iâd arranged for him to use, and the car hit him so hard it lopped off one of his feet. Died on the spot.
This was in early â97, a few months after Iâd transferred to L.A. from ATFâs Milwaukee office. I was an ambitious 31-year-old agent with a wife, a kid, and another on the way. Back in Wisconsin, Iâd taken an interest in working outlaw biker gangs, so I learned to ride on a friendâs Honda, then managed to get a Harley that ATF had seized, a Fat Boy with straight handlebars, no windshield, no saddlebags. I rode to biker bars and events. I let my hair grow, dressed the part, tried to understand the scene. Iâm originally from Chicagoâs South Sideâa tough, working-class part of the city. I knew how to be around bad guys because I grew up with a lot of them. Iâm not sure if I blended in because I was fairly quiet and soft-spoken, or if I got that way in order to blend in.
After four years in Milwaukee I was reassigned to California and brought the bike, Wisconsin plates and all. My goal, the one I proposed to my new bosses, was to investigate and infiltrate the one-percenters of Greater L.A. After arriving, I got in touch with the L.A. County Sheriffâs Department. Theyâd been keeping tabs on these guys. My contact there told me about a potential confidential informantâa CIânamed Junior. He said Juniorâd tried to join the Hells Angels but had been ârun down the roadâ for some reason. I got Junior a bike and gave him some cash. We started in Hollywood, where he had a connection with the local Vagos chapter.
The name is Spanish slang for someone who does nothing all dayâa vagrant or vagabond. They formed in the 1960s in the Inland Empire, and while they do have a Hispanic presenceâthe Venice chapter back in the day was pretty much entirely Hispanicâtheyâre mostly white; no blacks. The horned creature on their patch is Loki, a god of mischief in Norse mythology.
But you donât get to wear that logo as a âfull-patchâ member without putting in a lot of time. Unless you have enough street cred or contacts to get âwindowed in,â the first step is to hang around until they give you permission to refer to yourself as, well, a âhang-around.â Make it through that phase, and you become a âprospect.â Then they give you the ârockerââthe bottom part of the patch that goes on the back of a vestâwhich means theyâre gonna really test you to get the full patch. Junior wasnât an official hang-around, but I was playing the long game: I wanted him to get his patch, and heâd be able to vouch for me so I could try to get my patch, too.
Junior had some contact with a guy in the Vagosâ Hollywood chapter named Chuck [names have been changed], a short, beer-bellied dude with black-framed glasses. He wore a painterâs cap with the brim flipped up, had ink from neck to toes, and ran a tattoo shop in West Hollywood. Junior started hanging around there, and he was a good CIâshowed up on time, took license plate numbers, eavesdropped, reported back to me. In fact Iâd seen him a few hours before the accident, at a bar on the Strip where he gave me some information and I gave him some cash.
I was sitting in my office downtown the day after Junior died when his girlfriend called. I offered my condolences and hung up, wondering if I was screwed. âJunior must have talked about me,â I thought. Did his girlfriend know any of the Vagos heâd been hanging around with? Did he tell her he was working with ATF? If the same thing happened today, Iâd call of the operation. But I was young, and ATF hadnât done many of these biker gang infiltrations; there wasnât a lot of official protocol. So I decided Iâd pay Chuck a visit.
GRILLED
I parked my bike outside the tattoo shop. I knew what Chuck looked like from the sherifâs departmentâs binders, but I had to fake it and ask for him inside. I introduced myself as Koz, which is my real nicknameâshort for Kozlowskiâbut I figured if anyone asked, I could say that it was short for âKamikazeâ because of how I rode my Harley or some bullshit like that. I wanted a name that I responded to instinctively.
I told Chuck I was a buddy of Juniorâs, that I knew heâd been hanging around the Hollywood Vagos, and that I had some bad news. Chuck knew about the crash on the Strip but not that Junior was involved. We talked for a while, and he told me to come back in a few hours. When I showed up again, Chuck got on his bike and had me follow him east to their clubhouseâbasically a two-level cinder-block warehouse at Hollywood and Kenmoreâwhere I rode in and somebody locked the chain-link gate behind me. There were about ten guys, their bikes all lined up. Chuck introduced me. âWait here,â he said and went in the building with the other guys.
An hour or so later, someone came out and called for me. âGet in here.â As I walked inside, this heavily fortified metal door slammed behind me, and they patted me down for a wire. Now Iâm scared shitless, locked in a windowless building with a bunch of outlaw biker dudes who were very likely convicted felons. I had no cover team, and I didnât have much in the way of what we call a âbackstopââa story about who I am or what I do for a living, though I was at least carrying a driverâs license and Social Security card under my alias.
They patted me down and found my service weapon in my boot, a SIG Sauer semiautomatic. Back then, the LAPD carried Berettas, so I wasnât too concerned that theyâd suspect me of being undercover. Even though their guns were on a table, they let me keep mine. Next thing I knew, I was being interrogated. Four Vagos kind of stood out. There were Tiny Dan and L.A. Lenny, who happened to be badge-carrying L.A. County juvenile probation officers. There was Lars, the chapter president, who was super fit from training as a boxer and whose wardrobe consisted of jeans and a white T-shirt. And then there was Big Rick, a large guy in his late thirties or early forties with a long ponytail, a Fu Manchu mustache, and a ânobody fucks with meâ air of authority. He held the title of international sergeant at arms. Outlaw biker gangs are organized like the mafia or the military, which makes sense, since the gangs were started by ex-military guys after World War II.
I was shaking so hard I couldnât even work the kickstand on my bike. I just dropped it.
So there I was, in whatâs essentially a bunker, and I knew I was shaking. I was pretty sure they knew it, too. Big Rick did most of the talking.
âHow did you know Junior?â
âWhy are you carrying a gun?â
âWhy do you have Wisconsin tags on your bike?â
This went on for at least 30 minutes, and I had to wing it. Big Rick took notes the whole time, and I was trying to keep my story straight, thinking, âWhat kind of outlaw takes notes!?â
At one point, Big Rick said to me, âWe have reason to believe that Junior was working with ATF.â
It felt like my head went completely sideways. He didnât say âLAPDâ or âthe copsâ or âthe feds.â He said âATF.â I have no idea what came out of my mouth next, except that it was pure bullshit. I wasnât thinking about my wife or my kid or my kid on the way. I was focused on not getting a bullet in the head.
Whatever I said satisfied them. When we got back outside the building, they told me they were going to a bar and that I should follow. They got on their bikes and turned east on Hollywood. I turned west, gunning it to the 101 and the 170 into North Hollywood, where two ATF agents waited for me in a parking lot. I was shaking so hard I couldnât even work the kickstand on my bike. I just dropped it.
Maybe the Vagos knew someone in the LAPD who pulled the VIN off Juniorâs bike and linked it to ATF. In any case, I figured it was a lost cause. But a week later my pager went off. It was Big Rick. I had more bravado on the phone: âYouâre probably calling to tell me you checked into my story and learned itâs all bullshit. And guess what? Youâre right. You guys had some hair up your ass about who I am, talkinâ about cops and ATF and a bunch of other nonsense. I donât know any of you, and I had no reason to trust any of you, so I fed you some bullshit and got the hell out of there. I didnât know where you were going or if you were gonna take a pipe to my head or what. And you know youâd have done the same damn thing.â
Rick didnât seem fazed. âHey man,â he said, âIâm just calling because weâre having a function this weekend at the clubhouse. We want you to come back. But leave your gun at home.â
This meant one of two things: Either they were gonna let me become a hang-around or they were gonna kill me.
AFTER HOURS
The Hollywood chapter, which had about ten members who lived all over L.A., threw a regular party called Green Hell. (Sometimes the Vagos refer to themselves as Green Nation.) Plus Loki has sort of a Satanic vibe, what with his horns and all. They also flaunt the number 22, since âVâ is the 22nd letter in the alphabet.
Green Hell went from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. at the clubhouse. It was a moneymaker. The guys would go to bars and strip clubs, recruit guests, and offer late-night work to the strippers. There was a cover charge and a cash bar, a pool table, a couple of stripper poles. It drew a big crowd. Hollywood people always showed up. The band Matchbox 20 came one night. The Guns Nâ Roses drummer, too. Even a few movie stars came. People liked the underground feel. I donât think most realized that it was a Vagos party or that if things jumped off, there could be serious violence.
My job was to stock the bar, watch the gate, work the door. At one Green Hell, a guy from the Armenian Power gang was making trouble, and when we tried to throw him out, he put up a fight. I knew I had to put hands on him to avoid blowing my cover. A few of us escorted him to the street and threw him into a parked car, which caused his head to smash the side-view mirror. A few days later, during churchâwhat outlaw motorcycle gangs call weekly chapter meetingsâa bunch of Armenian guys came to the clubhouse when I was watching the gate. One of them said, âI wanna talk to Lars.â Lars came out, they walked down the block, and within a few minutes theyâd brokered a peace deal. Everything was cool. A few months later, in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant where they all hung out, the Armenian guys showed me a trunk full of machine guns.
On another church night, I was outside by the gate when I looked up and saw a car rolling by. Then a hand with a gun emerged from the sunroof. Blap-blap-blap-blap-blap! I heard the zing of a bullet as it went past my ears. We never figured out who it was.
By that point it was late spring, and Iâd gotten more backstops in order: a place to live, some address history. My Harley had California plates, and I had a truck registered to my undercover name. Iâd rented a little apartment in a North Hollywood fourplex near Victory and Lankershim with its own garage. Iâd park my ATF vehicle, a small GMC truck, a few blocks away and walk to my undercover place and slip in through the alley. Sometimes Vagos would come by to hang out or see what I was up to. I had an ATF cover team in place about 50, maybe 60 percent of the time, doing drive-bys, but a cover team canât really save you in this type of role; it just keeps an eye out from time to time and cleans up if things go bad.
My best friend from the academy, Frank DâAlesio, was doing the same sort of infiltrating with the Vagos in Las Vegas at the time. It was a coincidence, but we used it to our advantage. Being an Italian American from a Rust Belt city with a mafia presence, Frank portrayed himself as a connected guy with side hustles across the country. He told them that he had a business associate from back East named Koz who was hanging around with Vagos in Hollywood, and I told the Hollywood Vagos about Frank. The Vagos have a rule thatâs basically âif it doesnât have to do with the club, itâs no one elseâs business.â Frank and I figured if we followed the rules, maybe theyâd respect us enough to do business together.
We would talk at night to keep our stories straight. Pretty soon Frank and one of his informants were making runs to L.A. Weâd see each other at Vagos functions, go on errands togetherâtaking packages from Point A to Point B, that kind of thing. We knew better than to ask what was in the packages; it was way too soon for that.
The head of the entire Vagos organization was a scraggly-haired, bald-domed guy called Whitey who was in his fifties and wore a cowboy hat and Fu Manchu. He looked like the comedian Gallagher, or a clown, which is funny because heâd brag that he was the first person to play Ronald McDonald in a commercial. He lived in the San Gabriel Valley. I remember one time he made me and Frank try to sell a bunch of videos of him riding around on a motorcycle. Anything to make money for the gang. We took the tapes to ATF, got some cash, and brought it back to Whitey.
THREADING THE NEEDLE
By month three of my hang-around phase, Iâd seen plentyâfelons in possession of firearms, guys using or selling drugs, the two probation officers associating with known felons involved in a criminal enterprise. I watched and listened and filled out reports as I got to know some of the Vagos. Big Rick would have me to his house in Covina, where he had a lot of weapons. Weâd go drink beer and play darts. He was kind of my sponsor, my main point of contact, not unlike Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco. (My original contactâChuck from the tattoo shopâwound up moving away.) I liked Rick, and I have to admit it felt good to have his confidence in me. People ask if I ever felt conflicted about tricking these guys. Sometimes I did, but you have to reel yourself in and remember theyâre part of a criminal organization.
One weekend in the summer of â97, about four months after becoming a hang-around, I was with a bunch of them headed to Las Vegas for a big officersâ meeting, which happens maybe once a year. They ride in tight formation, wheel to wheel and basically shoulder to shoulderâranking members up front, rank-and-file in the middle, followed by prospects, and finally the hang-arounds in the back, choking on exhaust and dust. And they ride fast. When you see a pack of them on the highway, thereâs a good chance theyâre going to a meeting, unless theyâre out to show their presence and mark territory. Or they could be on a ârunâ to a fund-raiser where theyâll take over a park or campground, hand out fliers, charge a cover, sell food and beerâitâs basically a bake sale for bad guys.
On that weekend in Vegas, the Vagos rented out a VFW hall. Whitey, Lars, Chuck, and Big Rick were there. So was Frank, since he was local. We knew we were close to becoming prospects because theyâd made us fill out applications. Thatâs another weird thing: Outlaw biker gangs make the path to membership pretty damn official. They do background checks. You give them a Social Security number, driverâs licenseâall sorts of stuff, including a fee, which goes toward a private investigator. By chance, I met the PI vetting me. He was hanging around with some Vagos, and when I introduced myself, he was like, âYeah, manâI know who you are.â
At the VFW hall, Frank and I werenât allowed to hear the others talk business. We sat in another room, waiting to be called in. I believe I went first. As I walked in, I was facing all the high-ranking officers. They asked, âAre you willing to kill for the club?â They more or less played head games with me to see what Iâd say and to test my commitment. But after a few minutes, they eased up and gave me my bottom rockerâthe part of the patch that says âSoCalâ on it.
It was official: I was a prospect. When they were done with me, they called for Frank and did the same routine on him. Even though you can wear what you want, outlaw motorcycle gang members always wear a denim or leather vest. Itâs basically the uniform. The Vagos told me and Frank we had 30 minutes to get the rockers on our vests, so we found an upholstery shop nearby and had our bottom rockers sewn on. Later, when I was with the Warlocks, I was ordered to carry a sewing kit. I think one-percenters are the only outlaws on the planet who keep a needle and thread handy.
LOCKED UP
Being undercover is a terrible way to live. You actually have three lives: your undercover persona, your family persona, and the persona as a law enforcement officer, doing the paperwork and acting like a respectable civil servant. Even though I knew management had my back, dealing with them was the hardest part. They wanted results faster than I could deliver, and they didnât understandânot in any real wayâthat every time I was with the Vagos I could have wound up dead. And at the same time I was wondering if I was gonna get whacked, I had to take mental notes about everything I was seeing and hearingâthe guns, where I was told to take a package, whoâs in possession of what illegal substances. The only reason it didnât drive me insane was because I was too busy trying to juggle it all, to keep it straight and survive.
Once youâre a prospect, they own you, especially if you donât have a straight job. I wished Iâd made a real job part of my backstory. They thought my hustle with Frank was the extent of it, so they figured I had loads of free time when, really, I had a family at home. They called me a lot. It could be anything from âHey, prospect, cut my grassâ or âHey, prospect, take this package over to Big Rickâs placeâ to just hanging out. Saying no wasnât an option.
I was missing doctorsâ appointments for the kids, coming home too tired to do dad duties, and making my wife deal with the whims of my undercover work. I knew it was tough for her. Later, when I traveled back East to infiltrate the Warlocks, Iâd be gone for months at a time, which put a huge strain on my family life. My long shaggy hair, goatee, grubby clothes, and steel-toed boots didnât help, especially in the suburbs, where I lived during those cases. I canât tell you how many times I showed up at my kidsâ school functions only to see parents and teachers shy away from me. If I wanted to lie low, Iâd dress a bit nicer, but I was hardly clean-cut. When I infiltrated the Mongols in L.A., I got fully sleeved out with tattoos, so blending in as a civilian got even harder.
Some Vagos, mostly guys from the San Fernando Valley and San Gabriel Valley chapters, used to hang out at a bar near Sunland and Foothill boulevards in the Tujunga area. The owners supposedly didnât like them wearing their patches in the place and gave them a hard time. So that juvenile probation officer, Tiny Danâhe was obese, with close-cropped hair and a dark goateeâ decided, âLetâs go to this bar and document how theyâre harassing us and discriminating against us.â The idea was to file a lawsuit and make some money. About a dozen of us rolled to this bar after meeting up and establishing the ground rules. One rule was âNo weapons of any kind.â The thing is, since becoming a prospect Iâd begun secretly carrying my gun again. My thinking was âIf shit breaks bad and Iâm supposed to help these guys or defend myself, I donât want to be caught flat-footed.â
We walked into the bar, and the Vagos had a chip on their shoulder from the jump, looking to stir shit up, talking with the bartender about wearing their colors. Somebody must have made a call or tripped an alarm because LAPD showed up within minutesâmultiple cars, lights flashing. They brought us outside one by one, lined us up in front of the bar, and started patting us down. One of them found my gun tucked in my waistband and called out, âGun!â
As I was being cuffed I looked down the line and the Vagos looked at me like, âWhat the fuck, Koz!? We said, âNo guns.â â
I was the only guy who got arrested, and I had to make it look legit. A neighbor of mine happened to be a ranking LAPD officer based in the Foothill station. He knew I was ATF, but he didnât know I was undercover until I told him everything in my cell. Even though I had an alias, a fingerprint check would have turned up my real identity because itâs cross-referenced with an FBI database. Tiny Dan also knew a girl at the front desk, which I learned only later; if sheâd gotten my real identity, she couldâve spilled the beans. But Dan came and bailed me out the next morning. The whole night, my wife was at home, wondering why she hadnât heard from me. When I finally saw her, she said, âI see that youâre not dead. So if you werenât in jail, youâve got some explaining to do.â
Before I went to court, my ATF colleagues met with the judge, and he agreed to go along with it to make things look by the numbers. In court, he sentenced me to two years of probation and time served at the Foothill station for carrying a concealed weapon. The whole episode actually gave me more street cred, but I hadnât forgotten about Juniorâs girlfriend or the grilling Iâd gotten a few months earlier.
PATCHED IN
By the fall of 1997, about seven months into the case, Frank and I had already been getting hints that we were going to get our full patches when all the Vagos met up at the next national run. This was good news. The bad news? Rumor was that itâd be in Mexico. Working on foreign soil as a federal agent is a bureaucratic nightmare. ATF would have had to notify the Mexican authorities, who could be corrupt or incompetent or simply unwilling to let us work there. And even if we thought we could pull it of, we still had to run it through the proper channels in D.C. We asked, âHey, can guys in an undercover role dip in and out of Mexico?â The answer wasnât only no, it was âHell no!â
The easiest thing would have been to go regardless, hope nothing happened, and come back without telling anyone. But if we got caught, our careers would be over. Frank and I decided our only option was to come up with an excuse not to go. At the time, ATF was part of the U.S. Treasury Department, which had its own federal criminal database. We managed to get something put into the system that red-flagged our aliases for suspicion of trafficking marijuana from Mexico into the U.S. near Brownsville, Texas. That way we could tell the Vagos, âHey, we got red-flagged a while back and canât cross the border.â And if they had a source with access to the system, itâd look true.
Fortunately, at the eleventh hour, the national run wound up being slated not in Mexico but in Fontana, near San Bernardino. That happens to be where the first biker gang, the Hells Angels, was founded; in nearby Redlands, a gang called Psychos got started before some of its members split off and formed the Vagos. For whatever reason, Frank, his CI, and the other Vegas guys didnât go to Fontana, but a hundred Vagos from other chapters made the run to this large property with a long dirt driveway. I worked security in front, bored as hell, watching my cover team drive by now and then. Finally someone from the gathering yelled, âProspect, get back here. And bring your bike.â
I got on my Harley, and as I rode down the driveway the gate closed behind me; up ahead, they all stood in a horseshoe formation, blocking me. Someone yelled, âGet off your bike, prospect!â Iâd barely put the kickstand down when they started pushing, shoving, slapping, even punching me. I couldnât understand what was happening. I was thinking, âDid I do something wrong? Do they know Iâm an undercover cop?â I was glad I wasnât wearing a wire, but mostly I was thinking, âIf this gets bad, just claw your way over that fence to the street! Donât let yourself fall to the ground with a hundred guys trying to stomp you with steel-toed boots.â
Lars, the Hollywood chapter president with a boxerâs build, was in front of me, pushing, yelling stuff I could barely process, like, âYou fucked up, Koz! First you got rough with the Armenian. Then you got people coming around shooting at you. Then you get arrested for possession when we agreed not to carry weapons. Youâre fucking trouble, man!â
I tried to stick up for myself without getting physical or making anybody angrier. Iâm like, âThatâs fuckinâ bullshit, Lars. I did what I needed to do.â
Then after a minute or twoâit felt like hoursâit all came to a stop. Lars handed me my full patch, grinned, and said, âGet that patch on.â Everybody started cheering.
When we left, my cover team was watching for me, assuming Iâd be at the back of the pack. But I was closer to the middle. After they finally spotted me, they were high-fiving one another. âHe got his patch! Heâs in!â
UNMASKED
I was excited, too. Iâd be able to attend church meetings, learn more about the inner workings of the gang. The six or seven months of workâthe stress on me and my familyâall of it was paying off.
Halloween came soon after I got my patch, and there was a party at a memberâs house in the San Fernando Valley, around Reseda and Parthenia. Some Vagos lived in two or three houses on the same block, and the party was hopping. I was even kind of enjoying myself. But then Lars, Tiny Dan, and a smelly, raspy-voiced guy named Pig Pen Pete found me and said, âWe need to talk.â We went to another backyard, which was empty, and Dan, the probation officer, said something like, âHey, we know you got patched in, but we still have some checking out to do. Iâm going to have to roll your fingerprints.â He was acting like it was a formality they forgot about, so I wasnât getting too hinked up. âSure man, whatever you need,â I said, trying to play it cool.
Dan pulled out an ink pad and fingerprint cards and took my fingerprints, asking me, âDo you go by any other names?â I told him no, and then we walked back to the party.
A few days later, I parked my government vehicle down the street from my undercover apartment in North Hollywood and walked down the alley so I could enter through the back door as usual. My undercover truck and Harley were in the garage.
No more than five minutes after I arrived, there was a knock at the door. It was Lars. âHey, we gotta call Big Rick,â he said, sounding kind of cold.
âAlright, whatâs up?â
He said, âLetâs just get Rick on the phone.â
When I put the phone to my ear, Big Rick said, âWhat were you doing today?â
Iâm like, âI donât know. I was out and about.â
Rickâs like, âOh, yeah? What were you doing?â
âTaking care of some business, nothing related to the club.â
Then he asked, âWell, what car were you in?â
I told him I drove my truck, and he said, âI donât think you were in your truck.â Turns out Lars and some guys were at my place earlier in the day. âThey went in your garage and saw your truck and bike.â
I started backpedaling: âOK, well, yeah, youâre right. I had a different car.â
âWhat kind of car was it?â
âItâs really none of your concern. I was in someone elseâs car, taking care of some stuff with other people. Nothing to do with the club.â
Rick told me to put Lars back on the phone, who didnât say much to Rick other than âYeahâ¦yeahâ¦yeah.â¦â He hung up, turned to me, and said, âWe still got some concerns about who you are. Whereâs your patch?â
Iâm like, âLars, are you kidding me?â
âWe may be wrong about this,â he said, âand if so, weâll owe you an apology. But right now, I need your patch until further notice.â
I was pissed. I wasnât about to let these assholes blow up all my hard work. I doubled down: âThis is bullshit. This is amateur hour. Why didnât you sort this shit out before? Is this some kind of joke?â
But Lars said, âDonât make contact and donât come around the clubhouse.â
At one of the SFV houses, we found a human skull wrapped in a bag. It wasnât decorative; it had material on it.
So I gave him my patch, vest and all. He was kicking me out of the Vagos two weeks after I was patched in and seven months into an operation that had taken me away from my wife, my newborn, and my two-year-old. Once I knew Lars was gone, I called my cover team, which rolled by to be sure other Vagos werenât outside waiting to kick my ass. Then they got me out of there. For the next eight weeks or so, I was back at the office, helping put together all the evidence we had on these guys so we could make some arrests and, hopefully, weaken the gang.
Looking back, I was lucky. According to an ATF agent in San Diego whoâd heard it from his own CI, the whole thing could be traced back to Junior, my own informant, and his girlfriend. Sheâd crossed paths with some Vagos right after I was patched in, and she told them that Junior had been working for the ATF when he died. She even gave them the business card Iâd handed Junior, which had my Wisconsin information on it. (Iâd crossed out the old phone number and written my L.A. number on it while I was waiting for new cards.) So the Vagos put the pieces together, and according to the CI, they were going to âtake careâ of me.
Out in Las Vegas, nobody suspected Frank of being undercover. They actually thought he was my target and warned him, âHey, your buddy Koz out in L.A., heâs with the ATF and heâs been working you.â Frank wound up on the phone with Big Rick and the Vagos president, Whitey, who said something along the lines of âI think Koz needs to be eliminated.â At that point Rick said, âIâm getting off this phone call right now,â and hung up. Frank used me as an excuse to lie low and slowly drift away from the Vagos without suspicion.
Over the next several months, we got warrants for Vagos in L.A., Vegas, and San Diego, and we assembled teams of officersâATF, LASD, LAPD, and local law enforcement from other countiesâto move on multiple locations. That included Rickâs place, Larsâs place, Tiny Danâs place, the Hollywood clubhouse, and the San Fernando Valley houses from the night of the Halloween party. The raids happened before dawn. I didnât participate, but I was at the SFV properties right after it all went down. Three Vagos were sitting handcuffed on the sidewalk. Pig Pen Pete was one of them, and he started yelling at me, calling me a motherfucker. All told, my work helped us make 13 arrests on everything from drug and gun possession in L.A. and Vegas to possession of commercial-grade explosives down in San Diego. At one of the SFV houses, we found a human skull wrapped in a bag. It wasnât decorative; it had material on it.
Frank and I received official recognition from headquarters in D.C., and our work inspired enough confidence to help ramp up and improve the undercover branch. It also helped us avoid making some of the same mistakes again in future cases. Looking back, I did a lot of things wrong and made a lot of mistakes. I was mostly flying by the seat of my pants, but that made me a better undercover agent when I infiltrated the Warlocks and the Mongols.
After my Vagos infiltration, the Hollywood chapter lost more or less half its membership. And when it started to pick back up, I worked behind the scenes as a co-case agent and supervising CIs on a two-year infiltration that netted several arrests across five Southern California counties on charges ranging from drug and gun sales to street terrorism, attempted murder, and murder. It wasnât lost on us that the number of people we put in handcuffs was 22. And if it wasnât for my first case with the Vagos, my workâand ATFâsâtaking down major players in the Warlocks, the Mongols, the Hells Angels, and the Aryan Brotherhood might not have landed indictments and convictions numbering in the hundreds. We didnât put them out of business, but we sure as hell slowed them down.

Story 172
Nvidia’s RTX 2000 graphics cards introduced ray tracing to the world of gaming in the latter-half of 2019, but today there are a variety of RTX and GTX cards that support it. The fancy-new lighting technique is a serious resource hog, meaning that the more expensive and modern cards handle it best, but most Nvidia graphics cards from the past few years can take a crack at its real time reflections and shadow effects.
But, what is ray tracing? And is it really worth upgrading for?
Virtual photons
Graphics technology is usually hard to explain, but ray tracing is rather simple. It attempts to emulate the way light works in the real world. Instead of creating pre-designed, or “baked-in” lighting for scenes in games, ray tracing traces the path of simulated light. Or, rather, millions of simulated lights. The light bounces off objects as it moves and interacts with their properties. If it bounces from a glossy green surface, for instance, its hue may change.
That’s essentially how light works in real life. A particle of light bursts forth from its point of origin and travels along until it interacts with an object, at which point its path is determined by that object’s properties. It might be absorbed by a dense, dark object, or almost entirely reflected by a mirror.
Ray tracing’s fundamental similarity to real life makes it an extremely realistic 3D rendering technique. There’s just one problem: It’s hard to simulate. Recreating the way light actually works in the world is complicated and resource intensive, requiring masses of computing power. Even Nvidia’s ray tracing rendering isn’t true ray tracing, whereby every point of light is simulated. Instead, it uses a number of smart approximations to deliver something that’s close to the same visual effect, but without being quite as taxing on the hardware.
Most ray tracing games now use a combination of traditional lighting techniques, typically called rasterization, and ray tracing on specific surfaces such as reflective puddles and metalwork. Battlefield V is a great example of that. You see the reflection of troops in water, the reflection of terrain on airplanes, and the reflection of explosions across a car’s paint. It’s possible to show reflections in modern 3D engines, but not at the level of detail shown in games like Battlefield V when ray tracing is enabled.
Ray tracing can also be leveraged for shadows to make them more dynamic and realistic looking. You’ll see that used to great effect in Shadow of the Tomb Raider.
Ray traced lighting can create much more realistic shadows in dark and bright scenes, with softer edges and greater definition. Achieving that look without ray tracing is extraordinarily hard. Developers can only “fake” it through careful, controlled use of preset light sources. That takes a lot of time and effort – and even then, the result isn’t quite right.
Some games go the whole hog and use ray tracing for global illumination, effectively ray tracing an entire scene. But that’s the most computationally expensive and needs the most powerful of modern graphics cards to run effectively. Metro Exodus uses it currently, but its implementation isn’t perfect.
Simulating any of these effects isn’t easy, which is why modern real-time 3D graphics – including those used in 3D games – have to use half measures more often than not. Nvidia uses techniques including denoising and Deep Learning Super Sampling to improve performance and to cover up some of the visual hiccups that occur from rendering fewer rays than would be necessary to create a truly ray-traced scene. Those are still reserved for pre-rendered screenshots and movies where high-powered servers can spend days rendering single frames.
The hardware behind the rays
To handle even these relatively modest implementations of ray tracing, Nvidia’s RTX generation of graphics cards introduced hardware specifically built for ray tracing. The Turing architecture uses the company’s new RT Cores to handle the technique in real time. They aren’t strictly necessary for ray tracing, as ray tracing effects can be run on GTX 10-series and 16-series graphics cards, though they are far less capable than top-tier RTX cards like the 2070, 2080, and 2080 Ti.
Nvidia released a breakdown of generating a single frame of Metro Exodus in April, where it showed how the rendering pipeline is laid out and how it is affected by ray tracing. While an RTX 2080 and GTX 1080 Ti might be roughly comparable in performance for non-ray traced games, when ray tracing is applied to a scene, it can take much longer for the 1080 Ti, without the dedicated RT cores, to generate the same image.
That’s why even the most powerful of GTX graphics cards like the 1080 Ti really struggle with ray traced games at anything above 1080p. But RT cores aren’t a silver bullet. Even the 2080 Ti, the world’s most powerful consumer graphics card with the most RT cores, struggles to hit 60 FPS or more in games like Battlefield V or Metro Exodus with ray tracing enabled at 1440p. This is a card that without ray tracing enabled is able to deliver high frame rates at 4K.
But it doesn’t have to be this way. Nvidia’s ray tracing method isn’t the only option out there. Crytek released a demo called Neon Noir in early 2019, which showed high-level ray tracing effects on a $300 AMD RX Vega 56, running at a smooth 30 FPS. There are also Reshade “path tracing” post-processing effects which deliver comparable visuals without anything like the same performance hit.
You’ll still want a powerful graphics card for ray tracing no matter the implementation, but as the technique catches on with game developers, we may see a broader array of supporting hardware at much more affordable prices.
How can you see ray tracing at home?
The first port of call is getting an Nvidia graphics card, because at this time, publicly available ray traced games require it. Any RTX or GTX card will do if you just want to see what a ray traced scene looks like, but if you want to play at a resolution above 1080p and with frame rates approaching or exceeding 60 FPS, your best bet is with the most powerful — and therefore the most expensive — graphics cards. A $1,000+ 2080 Ti isn’t necessary, but an RTX 2060 or 2070 is probably the baseline you want to aim for. That means spending between $350 and $550.
As for the games, the selection is still quite limited. The most fully featured implementations of ray tracing can still be found in the earliest of RTX demo games, like Battlefield V, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Metro Exodus. But the list is growing all the time. Stay in the Light is a new indie horror game built entirely around the use of ray traced reflections and shadows, and you can play through a remastered Quake II with RTX ray tracing now too.
Other RTX ray traced games planned for 2019 include Remedy Entertainment’s Control, as well as Mundfish’ Atomic Heart, among others.
You can also get a glimpse of high-end ray tracing effects in UL Benchmark’s Port Royal ray tracing benchmark

Story 173
Finding a good 10-inch tablet without breaking the bank can be a challenging task. The sub-$300 market is rife with 7-inch tablets whose better performance comes at the expense of a smaller screen, while 10-inch offerings often skimp on power in favor of size. The Insignia Flex 10.1, available exclusively at Best Buy, rings up for just $239.99 (list, 16GB), packs a bright 10.1-inch display, and offers enough power to satisfy most users.
Design and Hardware
The Insignia Flex measures 6.52 by 10.37 by 0.38 inches (HWD) and weighs 1.23 pounds, lighter than many 10-inch tablets including the fourth-generation Apple iPad, which weighs in at 1.44 pounds and the plastic-backed 1.41-pound Toshiba Excite 10 SE. Despite being called the Flex, the tablet feels very sturdy, with brushed metal covering much of the back panel.
The top inch of the rear casing is plastic and houses a tinny-sounding pair of stereo speakers on each end of the tablet. On right side is the volume rocker and Power button. The controls feel flimsy; they don't sit flush with the side of the tablet and instead hide underneath the edge. In my tests, the Power button didn't always respond when pressed, requiring the occasional firm push to get my point across to the tablet. When lying flat on a table I could only adjust the volume or turn off the tablet by lifting it a few inches.
The 1,366-by-768-pixel IPS display is easy to look at, with wide viewing angles and vibrant colors. Most current large-screen tablets pack 1080p screens, so the Flex is a bit behind the curve at just north of 720p, but it also costs a lot less than much of the competition. The 16:9 display is perfectly suited for movies and widescreen games in landscape orientation, but since it's thin and long, it looks a bit awkward in portrait mode.
The Flex is a Wi-Fi only tablet with 802.11a/b/g/n dual-band 2.4 and 5GHz support. There's no GPS, but you get Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR. The Miracast app allows for video streaming directly to or from your HDTV or other Miracast-enabled device without a wireless access point. Currently, few HDTVs support Miracast, so I wasn't able to test this feature.
Onboard storage is advertised at 16GB, but only 12.7GB is available, though you get a microSD slot that supports cards up to 32GB. The card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack, micro USB and micro HDMI ports are all on the right side and away from your hands, making it comfortable to hold the tablet in landscape mode even with the ports occupied. While holding the Flex in portrait mode I found myself accidentally adjusting the volume or turning off the display. The micro HDMI port is a nice addition, mirroring the tablet's screen on your HDTV. Rotating the tablet will change the aspect ratio on the Flex as well as the TV. Luckily this can be disabled. And you've got Miracast if you happen to have one of the few HDTVs that support it.
The 720p front-facing camera snaps 2-megapixel photos and enables video chat. The quality isn't the best, but it'll get the job done. There is no rear camera, but at this price point it's no surprise, and given the quality of most tablet cameras, it's not really missed.
OS and Performance
The Insignia Flex runs a largely unmodified version of Android 4.1.1, so it's a couple of iterations behind the latest 4.3 version of Jelly Bean. Bloatware is minimal here: The CinemaNow, Astro File Manager, Geek Squad, and FAQ apps are easily removable. The built-in media player handled every type of video and audio file we threw at it, save for FLAC.
Powered by Nvidia's older Tegra 3 processor running at 1.2GHz, the Flex performed well enough in our benchmark tests, scoring 13,847 on Antutu's CPU test, which measures all-around performance, and 56 fps on the Nenamark graphics test. Coby's similarly priced MID1065scored a mediocre 7804 on Antutu and 37.6 fps on Nenamark. These scores are fine for a sub-$300 tablet, but higher-end tablets like the Toshiba Excite Writeand its Tegra 4 processor managed 28,798 on Antutu, more than double the Flex. The Write also crushes the Insignia Flex in Taiji, another graphics benchmark, scoring 40.27 compared with the Flex's 11.52 frames per second.
Video playback was smooth and Web browsing was without hiccups. While the tablet performed well in most other aspects, I didn't have high expectations for gaming given the older CPU. Gameloft's Asphalt 8 was consistent in its inconsistency, with frame rates dropping dramatically when rendering difficult graphical elements. Glamour shots of the high-end cars were marred by a stuttering screen during close-ups. Casual, less graphically intensive games like Fruit Ninja and Candy Crush Saga were fine. During extended gameplay the tablet's temperature rose a bit, but not so much as to be a cause for concern.
Another drawback to the Tegra 3 platform is game incompatibility. Nvidia recommends downloading the TegraZone application from the Google Play Store to see a list of Tegra-compatible games. But most of these games are being released for tablets like the Toshiba Excite Write, with its Tegra 4 processor.
The Insignia Flex's battery life is good. In our rundown test, which loops a video with screen brightness set to maximum and the tablet's Wi-Fi on, the Flex lasted 7 hours, 48 minutes, besting the same-screen-size Toshiba Excite 10 SE by about 11 minutes, and the Coby MID1065 by three hours.
Conclusions
If you're looking for a big display and a big bargain, the Insignia Flex 10.1 is an excellent choice. Other tablets with the same screen size, like the slick and waterproof Sony Xperia Tablet Z and the high-definition Google Nexus 10, offer better performance and higher resolution screens, but at higher price points that force them to compete with our Editors' Choice large-screen tablet, the Apple iPad. The Flex's closest competitors are the Coby MID1065, which is similarly priced ($209.99), but only offers 8GB of integrated storage, and the Toshiba Excite 10 SE ($349.99), which is more than $100 more for the same capacity and similar features. The Insignia Flex provides a happy medium.

Lamborghini had once conquered the Nurburgring with the hardcore Huracan Performante. Then, along came Porsche and it shattered all the previous records with itd extreme 911 GT2 RS. Naturally, Ferrari isn't likely to sit behind the lines and content to be just a spectator. According to recent reports, the Maranello-based carmaker is now developing a hotter version of the 488 GTB which will be a spiritual successor to the 458 Speciale.
The track-focused 488 is expected to breathe out around 700bhp from its mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.9-litre V8. The torque is expected to increase substantially over the standard car’s 760Nm. As is the case with most Nurburgring cars, the hardcore 488 will lose a few precious kilograms from its total weight. If the weight saving measures of the 458 Speciale are anything to go by, the new mean machine will get no sound insulation for the engine bay, thinner glass for windscreen and windows with lighter ceramic brakes and forged wheels. It all would help Ferrari’s Ring champion to tip the scale at around 1400-1500 kilograms.
Unlike the Porsche or Lamborghini, Ferrari has the know-how of Formula 1. This expertise can help them make the car more aerodynamic than its adversaries. The standard 488 produces 325kg of downforce at 250kmph. On the other hand, the king of the ring, the 911 GT2 RS is capable of producing up to 340kg at the same speed. Ferrari could best that aerodynamic figure with their Ring contender.
Ferrari has remained tight-lipped so far about the new track-focused 488. However, a mysterious test mule of the 488 with multiple hardware upgrades was spotted on more than a few occasions. Now what remains to be seen is what the hardcore 488 will be called. The Italian carmaker is rumoured to use the iconic GTO moniker, but that is yet to be confirmed. The exclusive GTO badge has only graced three cars in the company’s 70 years history. The ultra-rare 250 GTO of 1962 was followed by a 288 GTO in 1987, both of which were homologated race cars. The 2010 599 GTO was not homologated for racing though but was a road-legal version of the track-only 599XX. So whether Ferrari would use the GTO insignia or not is yet to be confirmed. If not, the hardcore 488 can make do with other insignias from Ferrari’s rich heritage such as Stradale, Scuderia or even the Speciale.
We expect to see the new hardcore Ferrari sometime next year. When it arrives, we hope it spice things up for the contentors of the ‘King of the Ring’ crown.

The bookstore at Grand Canyon University soon will transition to a new location, a new name and whole new feel.
In early May, the store will be closed in its current location — Building 26, west of Classroom Building 16. It is scheduled to reopen on Monday, Aug. 10, on the first floor of Prescott Hall with a new name, the “Lope Shop.” (Scroll to the bottom of this story for a list of things to know about the new location.)
The new look will include GCU insignia apparel and souvenirs, supplies (art, computer, technical and general), a faculty author section, reference and study aids, and non-insignia gifts and cards.
In a sign of the increasingly just-a-click-away times, textbooks will be sold entirely online. Students can purchase them at textbooks.gcu.edu through the University’s official supplier, Follett, and they also can go to Amazon, Barnes & Noble or any other online book outlet that has the correct titles and editions.
Specific information about which courses use digital or print materials is at textbooks.gcu.edu.
“The vast majority of students already are acquiring printed textbooks through some other mechanism than the bookstore,” said Mark Alexander, senior vice president of curriculum and content services.
Not only will the new store gain retail space with the absence of books, it also will be about 2,200 square feet, almost twice as big as the old one.
“It will be a fresh new feel, more of a retail feel,” Alexander said. “It will be like walking into a mall.”
The Lope Shop will be on “Lopes Way,” the new campus hub that will be built over the summer from the Student Union to Camelback Hall. Offices on the first floor of Prescott and Camelback will be moving elsewhere to make room for several new food outlets plus the campus store, and several outdoor dining areas will be installed.
While the new campus store is under construction, GCU merchandise will be available at the Team Shop in the Arena. The current bookstore building will be demolished to make room for a new soccer stadium.
Contact Rick Vacek at 602-639-8203 or rick.vacek@gcu.edu.
THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW CAMPUS STORE
When will the current bookstore close?
Right after commencement. It is scheduled to begin the moving process in the first week of May.
Where is it moving?
It will be on the first floor of Prescott Hall in a much larger space and with a new name, the “Lope Shop.”
Will it still sell books?
No. Students will buy all books online, either at textbooks.gcu.edu or at online booksellers such as Amazon.
Will the new store have the same merchandise?
No. It will be more like a regular retail store and, in addition to GCU insignia merchandise, will carry everything from computer supplies to birthday cards.
When will it open?
The new location is expected to open on Monday, Aug. 10.
What if I want to buy a GCU T-shirt between May and early August?
The Team Shop in GCU Arena will continue to have plenty of options.
What’s going to happen to the old bookstore building?
It will be demolished to make room for the new soccer stadium.

You have to be extra tough mentally to be an entrepreneur. While thinking about it, I realized that it’s really not that different from the toughness required and trained into America’s elite military force of Navy SEALs, who are known to be cool under fire, able to sense danger before it’s too late, and never give up on achieving their objective.
I just finished a new book “The Way of the SEAL,” co-authored by Mark Divine, who spent many years with the SEALs, and has since started and built six multimillion-dollar business ventures. He now teaches the key principles to business leaders through his Unbeatable Mind Academy, focusing on the following lessons and strategies, which I recommend for every entrepreneur:
Lead from the front, so that others will want to work for you. To be an entrepreneur or a Navy SEAL, you must first have vision, focus, and the courage to step up to lead. That means visibly walking the talk and willing to clear a path for others. People want to follow leaders they can learn from, who demonstrate excellence and commitment in all they do. Focus on one thing until victory is achieved. SEALs call this front-sight focus, or the ability to envision your goal to the point that you see it, believe it, and make it happen. Every entrepreneur needs this kind of focus to build a minimum viable product, target the right customer segment, differentiate from competitors, and drive business growth. Think offense, all the time, to eradicate fear and indecisiveness. Indecision leads to doubt, then the two blend and become fear, which signals defense, resulting in being overrun in the business world, as well as the military world. Offense, for entrepreneurs, means leading with a new business model, new marketing, and new technology. Never be thrown off-guard by chaotic conditions. Smash the box and think outside the box. In the world of the entrepreneur and the SEAL, chaos is the norm, not the exception. Plan for it mentally and physically, and you will see opportunities rather than problems in the chaos. Winning is finding opportunities, rather than fighting problems. Access your intuition so you can make “hard right” decisions. Your intuition is really your knowledge and awareness of your business environment, which must be honed with practice and focus. This knowledge is required for you to turn quickly or pivot based on new input from the market, without loss of competitive position. Achieve twenty times more than you think you can. Set your targets high. Nobody knows what they are truly capable of, with the right discipline, drive, and determination (three Ds). SEALs challenge themselves to find their 20x factor, and entrepreneurs should accept no less of a challenge. Leverage the resources of mentors, investors, and peers.
By teaching and practicing the principles behind these six lessons, Mark Divine was able to improve the pass rate of Navy SEAL candidates from less than 30% to over 80%. I see the same potential for improving the success rate of new entrepreneurs from the current 10-year survival rate below 30%, to a new high target of 80% in this new era.
He suggests that you start with a self-assessment against the “five mountains” to be climbed on the path to self-mastery and success, with my adaptation for entrepreneurs:
Physical: business as well as technical skills required for the domain you want to enter.

I agree with Divine that if you desire serious change in your life, you can’t get there by focusing on what you don’t want. Becoming an entrepreneur is a great lifestyle, but it is a serious change from other career alternatives. If you decide to be an entrepreneur because you don’t want a boss, on don’t like regular business hours, you may be setting yourself up for failure.
Apply the lessons from the Navy SEALs and you too can be an elite warrior who leads and succeeds in the new global business paradigm. Are you up to the challenge?

One of the stories that generated a fair bit of coverage today was the rise of “rogue” Twitter accounts popping up for agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Park Service (NPS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Accounts like @RogueNASA, @AltNatParkSer, @ActualEPAFacts and @Alt_NASA claim to be run by active or former employees of the agencies and have all attracted followers rapidly, with @RogueNASA earning 87,000 followers as of the time of this writing and @AltNatParkSer having 690,000 followers. What can we learn about the future of government communication from this act of civil disobedience?
At first glance, one of the most remarkable aspects of the accounts is that, as their avatars, they used (updated below) the official logos of the agencies they are attempting to speak on behalf of, yet many federal agency logos are strictly controlled. For example, the EPA logo policy states that for any organization which wishes to “reproduce the EPA logo or seal for purposes acceptable to the Agency, permission must be granted by OPA, which will provide a copy of the logo or seal.” NASA guidelines are even more strict, stating “The NASA insignia logo (the blue "meatball" insignia), the retired NASA logotype (the red "worm" logo) and the NASA seal may not be used for any purpose without explicit permission. These images may not be used by persons who are not NASA employees or on products, publications or web pages that are not NASA-sponsored.” NPS takes its restrictions even further, referencing possible criminal prosecution: “The arrowhead symbol is the official insignia and registered mark of the NPS. As such, it is protected by trademark laws and by 18 U.S.C. § 701, which provides for criminal penalties against non-governmental use of Government marks and other insignia. The arrowhead symbol may not be used without prior written permission from the Director of the NPS.”
While U.S. copyright and trademark law do provide for the concept of parody, the accounts in question have positioned themselves less as satiric and humorous parodies of the official accounts they mimic, but rather as resistance accounts that purport to offer the true story of those organizations. In particular, the accounts have positioned themselves in their tweets as alternative authoritative resources for those interested in their respective agencies’ research, replacing the official accounts. In fact, the @AltNatParkSer account has almost twice as many followers as the official @NatlParkService account.
I reached out to Twitter for clarification on how it views the use of trademarked or copyrighted imagery in the avatars of such accounts. A company spokesperson offered only that “we don't comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons” and included links to the platform’s impersonation and parody policies “which include instructions on how to report an account.” When I asked if Twitter performs automatic “digital fingerprint” scanning of its platform for copyrighted or trademarked imagery -- much as it has promised to do for other kinds of imagery -- the company did not respond, nor did it respond to a request for clarification on how it handles the issue of trademarks and copyrighted content being posted on its platform on such accounts.
Rogue Twitter accounts are fun, but gov't employees and scientists are very afraid of being fired if they speak out & share facts. #resist — Rogue NASA (@RogueNASA) January 25, 2017
Neither the NPS nor EPA immediately responded to requests for comment, but a NASA spokesperson confirmed that the agency had not granted permission for its logo to be used by @RogueNASA and similar accounts and that the agency had filed a formal complaint earlier today with Twitter, yet as of the time of this writing the “rogue” account and its NASA logo avatar remain intact. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment on why it has not acted on the request.
This raises a fascinating question of how copyright and trademark law will intersect with parody and satire in the social media era. Imagine if a group of Amazon’s warehouse workers banded together and created a series of new Twitter accounts with handles like “@rogueamazon” or “@altamazon” or “@realamazon” and used the company’s official logo as their avatars and began pouring out statements attacking the company’s working environment, worker rights, etc., offering that they, rather than the official Amazon account, provided the true story of Amazon.
Rewind the clock 50 years ago and such campaigns would have been nearly unimaginable, yet today all it would take is a few employees to generate a massive online campaign that could quickly generate hundreds of thousands of followers and widespread press coverage. This should serve as a stark reminder, yet again, to companies of the power of viral campaigns to displace their official branded social channels with counter messaging. Here, instead of enforcing control over messaging about EPA, NPS and NASA, the agencies have lost control over their messaging as these new accounts (likely to be the first of many) step forward to speak on behalf of them.
Yet, in conversations this afternoon with colleagues in the cyber security realm, a common theme that emerged was how dangerous this proliferation of unofficial social media accounts speaking on behalf of U.S. government agencies is from a cyber standpoint. In short, since we have no idea who is behind these accounts, we have no idea whether they truly are run by agency employees or whether they have been set up by hackers looking to spread ransomware, surveillance software, botnet infections or other harmful software by riding on the immense popularity of these sites and the lack of the authoritative “blue checkmark” proving who is who. Indeed, already @RogueNASA has been joined by @Alt_NASA, and numerous other resistance-style accounts are popping up.
In such a frenetic fast-paced environment, imagine a new @NASAResistance account being registered by a set of hackers who at first tweet out a flurry of climate change or science-related tweets, linking to agency publications and data sets, then gaining a large follower base. Quietly, the account then copies legitimate PDF and Word files, infects them with malware then links to them, riding the wave of current interest and popularity to generate a high volume of clicks. All it would take is a few well-timed tweets (perhaps right after a news report claiming the EPA was about to delete all of its climate data?) to result in tens of thousands of well-meaning citizens downloading a virus to their computer. Or, instead of sending links to virus-infected files, anti-climate change activists could post real data and publications, but make subtle changes to them, adjusting a few numbers here and there in ways that would not immediately be detectable. In the urgent grab-it-all-before-its-gone world of volunteers quickly downloading everything they can, one could easily propagate these modified files far and wide. If enough time elapses before anyone spots the errors, or if scientists begin to publish using their local copies without verifying them, it could undermine trust in the data.
These new accounts also raise the fascinating question of government control over its messaging online. When it comes to websites, only U.S. government agencies may register a .gov top-level domain, which is administrated by the GSA. Multiple processes are in place to ensure that a random individual somewhere in the world cannot simply register “roguenasa.gov” and put up a new website this afternoon. Yet, when it comes to social media, the official NPS Twitter account does not exist in a special “government” section of the platform, meaning it only has its blue checkbox to confirm it is the official account -- even though a recent Stanford study of high school students showed less than a quarter knew what the checkbox meant or to look for it. Otherwise, there is nothing to separate @AltNatParkSer from @NatlParkService except its much higher follower count. Indeed, Facebook treats official government accounts the same as all other accounts on its platform and has in the past even gone as far as to delete posts by government officials that it viewed as violations of its platform guidelines.
These new accounts also raise the fascinating question of whether “alternative” or “rogue” or “resistance” social media accounts will become a new norm even in Western nations that have not typically had a history of “governments in exile.” One could imagine that every administration would have its “rogue” employees who disagree with particular policies heading out to Twitter to fire up their own resistance accounts. Taking this a step further, the party not in power could set up its own alternative Twitter accounts for each federal agency and issue their own statements interpreting the actions of each agency through their particular partisan lens.
There are also fascinating questions about the operational security of the accounts’ operators – are they linking the accounts to email accounts with two factor authentication and are they sharing the login information among just one or two people or among a larger group that runs the risk of a password being compromised?
Putting this all together, it is a fascinating reflection of the social media era that a handful of government employees, united in their disagreement with new official government policies, could simply spin up a set of “resistance” social media accounts sharing the logo and similar name of their agencies’ official accounts and begin to live tweet as an “alternative” spokesperson for major US Government agencies. While traditional “parody” accounts are an established tradition of the social media world, the creation of alternative "official-like" outlets for government agencies that publish scientific statements rather than entertainment satire, poses a unique new challenge for government messaging and the interaction of government with its citizenry. One would also have to imagine the Russians aren’t far behind in exploiting this new world of resistance for information operations, leveraging the anonymity and ease of creation to create their own network of “resistance” accounts that similarly claim to be run by agency employees and publish similar statements, but with subtle shifts in their narrative, tone and focus or which spark wars over which accounts to trust.
In the end, the rise of this “rogue” Twitter army offers many lessons as governments move beyond the traditional controlled confines of reserved communication channels like press conferences and restricted web domains to the open and chaotic free-for-all of social media. It will be fascinating to see how it all plays out.
UPDATE (1/26/2017 9:08AM EST): The EPA responded by email earlier this morning to state the use of the EPA logo by @ActualEPAFacts was unauthorized and that the matter has been forwarded to "EPA's Office of General Counsel for further action." @ActualEPAFacts has changed their logo, as has @RogueNASA, while @AltNatParkSer acknowledged that its use of the NPS logo could result in "criminal prosecution" and requested users help it design a new one. @RogueNASA referenced the possibility of Hatch Act violations in announcing that it has handed control of its account to non-US Government personnel, while @AltUSNatParkSer also announced this morning that it was doing the same. It has also been noted that there is a blanket ban on the use of US Government agency trademarks and logos on social media pages.

Story 181
In a recent post I highlighted a teen-ager who found a small cigar box in the family attic holding about 85 tobacco baseball cards from 1909 to 1911 worth about $15,000. They belonged to his grandfather Ralph Henry Spare, Sr, who collected them as a boy in the Philadelphia area around the same time they were sold with cigarettes. After reading my post about The Fairy Godmother Find, kept in a woman’s hat box, he contacted Leighton Sheldon, president of Just Collect, in Somerset, New Jersey.
My last post on Spare focused attention on the fabled T206 tobacco cards he collected. In addition there were 27 T205 Gold Borders from 1911, a set long overshadowed by the T206s. The T205s’ short-prints and variations carry none of the cachet of holy grails such as the Honus Wagner and Eddie Plank, which sell from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Nor do they headline auctions or news stories in the general press. Indeed at the National Sports Collectors Convention in Atlantic City last week, the T206s probably outnumbered the T205s ten to one.
But I am not alone in my passion for these beauties. “ They are indeed some of the most beautiful cards ever produced,” wrote Rex Morgart on Baseball Card Collectors and Trading— Keep It Real! on Facebook in response to a query I posted. Added Brandon Perkins, “In my opinion it is one of the most underrated vintage sets because of the T206. Even though some cards are worth good money . The color stands out so much even after 100-plus years later.”
The cards’ striking design cast a permanent spell on me ever since I saw them when I 12-years-old. In 1973 I got my Dad to take me to one of the country’s first baseball card shows in downtown New York. The short stacks of T205 on folding tables gleamed like gems, thanks to their gold borders.
The only other baseball card set with gilded edges, the 1909 Ramlys, had black and white photos, a drawback. “Each [T205] card constitutes a work of art, marrying luxurious colors with an intricately balanced layout,” wrote the authors of Cardboard Gems. “The top two corners [are] festooned with the team’s insignia and moniker.” While the American league players’ cards are adorned with vintage baseball equipment, the National League’s feature a facsimile signature— an innovation that would not appear in a full color set for another 41 years.
As a boy in 1911, Ralph Spare enjoyed some good luck, acquiring four of the 27 Hall of Famers in the 220-card set. Two of them are among the most fascinating players in history.
“Three Finger” Brown exploited a severe handicap to compile a 239-130 record with a 2.06 ERA and 55 shutouts for Cardinals, Reds, and other teams. He was crucial to the Chicago Cubs’ last and only dynasty, anchoring a staff that won four pennants and two World championships 1906-1910. “A unique and wonderful pitcher,” wrote Bill James in his first Baseball Abstract. His actual name, Mordecai, is almost as cool as his nickname.
As either a five or seven-year-old boy, Brown caught his hand in a corn grinder on his uncle’s farm. His middle finger had to be amputated. Brown’s finger was mangled and his little finger stubbed. But his gnarled fingers created an extraordinary downward curve. “It was the most deceiving, the most devastating pitch I ever faced,” said Ty Cobb, the game’s career batting champion. Brown wrote a manual, How to Pitch Curves, for young boys. His other nickname was “Miner,” derived from his work in the coal mines during his teenage years back when men were men.
Charles “Chief” Bender, a fabulous money pitcher for the Philadelphia Athletic, won 20 games ten times en route to 210 victories against 127 losses with a 2.46 ERA. He had superb control of his fastball and threw a sharp-breaking curve, perhaps the first slider. Then there was “the dreaded’ talcum pitch,” wrote Ron Smith in The Heroes of the Hall. “Bender’s version of the spitter, dropped unexpectedly, and often generated a strong grin.”
The proud part-Chippewa Indian endured all sorts of racial stereotyping from the press and vicious bench-jockeying from opponents. He showed what he thought of being called Chief by signing his autographs “Charley Bender,” though he finally relented on his tombstone which was etched with Chief. Even upon his death in 1954, a year before he died, The Sporting News’ obituary carried the headline, “Chief Bender Answers Call to Happy Hunting Grounds.” For many years Bender was the only American Indian in the Baseball Hall of Fame.
To my amazement, in 1985, Bill James wrote in his Baseball Abstract that “most of the Indian players of the time were rather quiet and aloof.” Perhaps their silence was a self-defense mechanism. “Bender was cunning and smart, an intelligent man whose off-field hobbies ranged from gardening and tree care to painting and precious gems,” wrote Ron Smith.
The T205s of Brown and Bender book for about $350 in excellent condition, making them quite affordable. You can collect your favorite team or all the Hall of Famers without liquidating your retirement funds. If the set hasn’t soared in value yet in today’s baseball card bull market, perhaps it never will. But Ralph Sharpe, Sr knew a good thing more than a century ago when he decided to save his in a cigar box for posterity, permitting his great-grandson Eric and I could share them with you.

3.25 Listowel
Edmund & Josie Whelan Memorial Listowel Stakes (Listed) | 1m1f | 3yo+ | TG4/RTV
Why is it interesting?
Trainer Joe Murphy reckons the Listowel Stakes is a Group 2 in disguise and with five runners in the field rated 100 or higher, which doesn't even include the unbeaten Lancaster House, it is hard to argue with him.
Murphy runs Insignia Of Rank who is more than entitled to take his chance in the race, but he will be a rank outsider due to the calibre of opposition he faces and his trainer accepts he has little chance of success from his draw.
Perhaps the most interesting runner of all is Lancaster House, who won a Galway maiden by eight lengths on his first start and followed up in stylish fashion at odds of 2-7 at Tipperary.
Lancaster House: unbeaten in two runs for Aidan O'Brien
The highest-rated runner in the race is the versatile Riven Light, who boasts a mark of 109 and certainly won’t mind conditions given his record on soft ground.
Shelir was considered good enough to run in the Irish 2,000 Guineas in May after winning the Tetrarch at the Curragh, but his season has not progressed as planned and arrives on something of a retrieval mission.
What the stats say?
Willie McCreery won this race two years in a row with Devonshire (2015) and Champagne Or Water (2016) and he could be triple-handed this time around with Tipitena, Up Helly Aa and first reserve, Memyselfandmoi.
Riven Light, who was successful in this race in 2017, is back to try to win again for Willie Mullins.
It has been a profitable race for punters over the years with five successful favourites in the last decade, the most recent of which was Riven Light at 11-8.
What the trainers say?
Joe Murphy, trainer of Insignia Of Rank
This is like a Group 2 race and we have a very bad draw. We will need luck in running, although all the better horses seem to have wide draws. It is coming near the end of the season but he seems to be in good form at home.
Michael Mulvany, trainer of On The Go Again
He likes Listowel and won there two years ago. He returned to action at Killarney recently and should come on for the run. He is a very good horse on his day but might need another run to come back to himself.
Matthew Smith, trainer of Warnaq
She is in good form. She has had a bit of time off during the summer and is ready to start back out. The softer the ground, the better for her. It looks a really hot race so it won't be easy.
Fozzy Stack, trainer of Wargrave
It is a very competitive race but it always is. He has a nice draw in stall five and won't mind a bit of ease in the ground so fingers crossed he will go well.

Pompano Beach-based bank pushes into Sarasota area — and into Cuba
Stonegate Bank's first move into Southwest Florida didn't last very long.
The Pompano Beach-based bank opened an office in 2007 in Sarasota's downtown south area, but as the economy began to falter, it pulled out after about seven months.
Now Stonegate, which returned in 2014, just struck a deal to become an even bigger player in the region.
Stonegate will pay $36.5 million in stock to acquire Insignia Bank, a 10-year-old lender with two banking offices in Sarasota, loan production offices in Bradenton and St. Petersburg and a $188 million loan portfolio.
It's not the biggest deal Stonegate has made among the 10 healthy and failed banks it has acquired since 2009. President Dave Seleski said there aren't many larger Florida banks — in the $500 million- to $800 million-asset range — to target anymore.
"I don't see us doing larger deals," he said. "They just aren't out there."
Stonegate bought Florida Shores Bank-Southwest of Venice two years ago, adding its first offices in Sarasota, Venice and Englewood. After absorbing Insignia, it will become the seventh-largest bank in Sarasota County, with $412 million in deposits, vaulting from 14th place. While dwarfed by leader Bank of America, at $2.1 billion in deposits, Stonegate will be the biggest Florida-based bank in the county, with a 3.3 percent market share.
"After consummation of the merger, Stonegate's total combined deposits in West Florida are expected to exceed $850 million," Seleski said. "The combination will give Stonegate more leverage to deliver products to our target market in West Florida."
The bank is "very high" on the opportunities in the affluent county, Seleski said during a recent conference call. Insignia has a good portfolio of residential loans and is an active lender through the U.S. Small Business Administration.
"That's a great line of business we would like to do more," he said.
Insignia was the "cleanest bank" that the buyer looked at, Seleski said. The bank reported no non-performing loans in its second-quarter report and holds $1.9 million in real estate it has taken back from borrowers.
Insignia's beginning
Launched in October 2006, Insignia opened with $25 million in capital, the largest amount for a startup bank in the region. Chief executive officer Charles G. Brown III, who had previously headed Charlotte State Bank and Englewood Bank, built Insignia into a $248 million-asset lender, now the second-largest bank headquartered in the Sarasota-Manatee region.
He says Insignia was not up for sale, and Stonegate approached with an unsolicited offer.
"We have had many sniff around before, but did not find the right fit regarding both the people and pricing," Brown said.
"Comparing the future to other return and liquidity strategies for our shareholders, while remaining cognizant of the benefits for our customers and employees, this appeared to be the best direction over the next few years," he said.
The stock transaction works out to $13.52 per share of Insignia's common stock, or about 1.58 times its book value. Shares of Stonegate, which trade publicly on the Nasdaq, were selling for $32.60 Friday afternoon.
"People feel our currency is good and has a lot of upside to it," Seleski said, adding he feels the company is "undervalued" right now.
Brown will become CEO of Stonegate's four-office franchise in Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties. Tyrone Shinn, now west region market president at Stonegate, will continue in that role.
One Sarasota office will close, since Insignia's headquarters at Fruitville and Orange Avenue is one block west of Stonegate's branch on Fruitville. Insignia's main office is owned by Tim Clarke, a director and shareholder of the bank, who previously housed his advertising agency there.
Pending shareholder and regulatory approvals, the banks hope to close on the sale in first-quarter 2017. Data conversions will occur several months later.
"So, we are not sure if any, or to what degree, any job loss will take place since Stonegate is such a fast-growing company," Brown said. "Not only do they continue to have needs and have publicly called our group a 'great staff' as one of the reasons for their interest in our franchise, but we expect additional opportunities that might be caused by attrition at either organization in the interim."
Insignia becomes the first local bank to change hands since Achieva Credit Union bought Calusa Bank of Punta Gorda late last year.
Pushing into Cuba
While Stonegate has been expanding around Florida, it has garnered national attention for its bold moves into Cuba, the Caribbean island that had been cut off from the U.S. banking system by the 54-year-old trade embargo, including direct bank transfers and the use of American debit and credit cards on the island.
In June the bank issued the first U.S. credit card intended for use in Cuba, making it easier for Americans to travel and work on an island. The Mastercard lets U.S. travelers charge purchases at state-run businesses and a handful of private ones, mostly high-end private restaurants equipped with point-of-sale devices. Until now, Americans have generally had to bring cash to Cuba and change it either at state institutions that impose a 10 percent penalty on the dollar or in informal exchanges with locals.
“This is going to be huge for American companies trying to do business down here,” Seleski said in announcing the card.
The card's use is limited. Cuba has prevented cardholders from using them for cash advances. And while the bank says there are 10,000 point-of-sale devices across the island, cashiers in state-owned stores often say they are out of service, according to an Associated Press report.
A series of exemptions carved out by President Barack Obama after the declaration of detente with Cuba in late 2014 allows American companies to unblock debit and credit card use and open direct links to Cuban banks that permit financial transfers between the two countries.
Stonegate was first to open an account for the Cuban government and in 2015 became the first institution to issue a U.S. debit card for use in Cuba. The debit card allows point-of-sale purchases and was briefly authorized for ATM withdrawals before Cuba shut down that capability in order to implement new security measures.
About 100 American individuals and businesses had opened Stonegate accounts with debit cards approved for Cuba as of June, nearly half of them education institutions and travel companies that organize hundreds of trips a year to the island.
The Cuban government is exempting the cards from the 10 percent government penalty on dollar transactions, making them the cheapest legal way for travelers to move dollars to the island.
Cubans receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year in remittances from relatives living in the United States and other countries.

As my annual series of Holiday Gift Guides continues, I tackle one of the most popular categories of gifts, wine and spirits. The good news is that the range of liquor offerings has exploded, along with the craft cocktail renaissance, and there are a lot more unique choices than ever before. The bad news is that the range of liquor offerings has exploded and there are a lot more mediocre products on the market with fancy labels than ever before. My picks run the gamut from affordable and accessible to esoteric and collectible, but there is something here for everyone at every price point, and unlike many magazine and online gift round-ups, I have personally tried and approved each of these (unless otherwise indicated). It was hard to narrow it down to just ten, so if you count carefully, you will find a bonus selection has been included. Check out my other themed gift guides for Foodies, for Travel, for Golf, for Outdoor Recreation, and for Skiing and Snowboarding.
Hibiki Japanese Harmony Whisky: Since winning the vaunted title of world’s best whisky two years ago, Japan has moved onto center stage among connoisseurs, especially for its high-profile single malts. I still give top marks in the single malt category to Scotland, yet when it comes to blends, Japan cannot be beat. As much I enjoy ultra-premium blends like Johnnie Walker Blue and Chivas Imperial, my single favorite blended whisky of all time is Hibiki - famously the choice of Bill Murray’s character, a celebrity spokesman for Suntory Distillery in the film Lost in Translation. Suntory makes Hibiki, and just rolled out this new version early in 2015. Inspired by the 24 seasons of the traditional Japanese lunar calendar, Japanese Harmony is a complex blend of at least 10 malt and grain whiskies, from three of Suntory’s oft awarded single malt distilleries (Yamazaki, Hakushu and Chita), aged in five different types of casks, including rare Mizunara (Japanese oak). Much more complex than typical blends, it is also something most whisky lovers have never tried, at a price that is very reasonable for finer Japanese whiskies. It comes in a decanter-style bottle cut in 24 facets, representing the seasons ($65).
Usquaebach Old Rare Superior Scotch Whisky: If you want to go the more traditional whisky route and stick to a Scotch blend, but want to be more creative then the big brands (Chivas, Johnnie Walker, Dewar’s), consider Usquaebach. The company has been owned by the same family for three generations, but dates back over two hundred years and uses only Highland whiskies. There are three tiers to the line, but The Old Rare Superior Blend is the flagship, still dramatically packaged in its original 18th century porcelain flagon dating back to a time before glass, when all whisky was bottled in ceramic. It is created from 41 single malt Scotch whiskies and two grain whiskies aged in sherry casks ($115).
Joseph Phelps Insignia: First produced in 1974 and named Wine Spectator’s “Wine of the Year” in 2005 - number one on earth - Insignia is simply one of the greatest wine labels you can buy. It is a fixture on the lists of the world’s best restaurants, and much easier to obtain than similar wines which tend to be obscure cult bottles. Joseph Phelps Vineyards is a family-owned winery committed to crafting world class, estate-grown wines, with eight estate vineyards in the Napa Valley. The house makes a variety of high quality wines, but is best known for Insignia, its flagship Napa Valley blend of red Bordeaux varieties and a classic “big” California red. Anyone who knows wine will be ecstatic to get one of these. The latest release is the 2012 (75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot, 10% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc), which was an excellent year in the area, and critic Robert Parker gave it a 96 rating, suggesting it was the best since 2002 and can easily be kept 35-30 years ($240).
Sequoia Grove Cabernet Sauvignon: For fans of classic big California cabs looking for something excellent but less dear than the Insignia, Sequoia Grove is a perfect choice. This is a wine I have been a fan of for more than 20 years, and at this year’s Pebble Beach Food & Wine Festival I attended a wonderful pairing lunch where all courses were coupled with wines from the boutique producer, whose motto is “bigger by complexity.” 2012 was an excellent year in Napa (77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot,1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec), the best in a decade, and this fruit driven house flagship gets the winery’s very best grapes. It got an impressive 93 point rating from the Tasting Panel, while Wines.com compared it to pricier cabs such as Silver Oak and Duckhorn ($38).
Facundo Exquisito Rum: The Facundo collection is the top of the line range from Bacardi, and Exquisito is one of four hand-blended sipping rums in the collection. A tribute to Bacardi’s legendary founder Don Facundo Bacardi Masso, this is an ultra-premium rum blended from carefully selected stocks 7 to 23 years old, aged in oak barrels and finished in sherry casks, just like many of the world’s finest Scotch whiskies. Balanced between the fruitier notes of younger rum and the smoky, spicier character of the unusually old rum included, it is a smooth rich sipping elixir that will delight any rum lover on your list ($120).
Champagne Palmer: You simply cannot go wrong giving French bubbly, but if you want to raise eyebrows, skip the household names and consider this venerable house that only entered the U.S. market this year - after nearly seven decades of excellence. Following WW II, seven growers who wanted to produce the highest quality wines exclusively from grapes grown on Premier and Grand Cru-designated vineyards around Reims got together and launched Champagne Palmer in 1947. They have followed strict dedication to craft - stricter even than required by obsessed French law. Even the anything-but-entry-level non-vintage labels are aged a minimum of four years - more than three times the legal standard, longer than is even required for pricier vintage champagne, and excessive even for top houses. Four labels are offered in this country, from the brut reserve to a rose version to a 100% chardonnay blanc de blancs to the brand’s prestige cuvee, Amazone de Palmer ($52-$140).
Few Barrel Aged Gin: Barrel aged gin is the single hottest new spirit category around, and takes what was long known as a clear or white spirit and turns it into something closer to but not quite a brown spirit. Ironically, this is a retro trend - before gin was individually bottled, in the 17th century, it was shipped from Holland to England in wooden casks and all gin was cask finished. Barrel aged gins can go towards either end of the cocktail spectrum, perfect in darker traditional gin cocktails like a Negroni or Martinez, but they can also take the place of whisky to lighten up classics like an Old Fashioned for gin lovers. A “grain to glass” producer, Chicago-area craft distiller Few has quickly become a favorite of mixology-driven bartenders for fancy cocktails, and the company uses only grain (corn, wheat, rye, barley) grown within 150 miles. Few Barrel Gin is aged in a mix of new American oak barrels and used bourbon and rye barrels. The result is a sweet and spicy spirit that marries the flavor of gin with the texture of whiskey ($50).
Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye: You simply cannot get more bang for the buck than this in the spirits world: shortly after introducing its first-ever blended rye, Crown Royal received the ultimate honor, when its Northern Harvest Rye was named the 2016 World Whisky of the Year by Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible. This is like a film winning Best Picture, beating out all other whiskies, whether from Scotland, Ireland, Japan or the U.S. Yet it costs less than half as much as an entry level bottle of single malt Scotch and significantly less than any other high quality whisky - there are ryes that cost three times as much. Crafted from 90% rye, a higher purity than most, it is flavorful, yet extremely smooth ($30).
Cain Five Vertical Box: Need a more impressive wine gift or something for a collector? Cain Five is one of the most respected New World meritages, or wines produced in the traditional Bordeaux style - the most classic of all wine types. While most meritages use just two or three of the five traditional grapes blended for Bordeaux, Cain Five is so named because it always uses all five: cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot, malbec, and petit verdot. This results in a powerful wine, but one more structured than many big California cabs. It is a small production, estate bottled wine from one of Napa’s most acclaimed vineyard districts, Spring Mountain, and it is allocated, meaning most bottles are sold to members of the winery’s mailing list and it can be hard to get. Since 2000, Cain Vineyard & Winery has held back some bottles for its library-edition program. They are currently releasing a three vintage boxed vertical set of 2001, 2002, and 2003 ($635).
Ornellaia Le Serre Nuove: One of the most coveted and collectible names in the wine world, Ornellaia is a famous “Super-Tuscan,” wines that are produced in the heart of the Chianti region yet are not technically chianti, but rather an Italian take on the red Bordeaux-style. These include some of the world’s greatest wines. Produced in the Maremma, Tuscany’s coastal region, Ornellaia is often ranked in the world’s Top 10 wines, and has received the very rare perfect 100 point score from Wine Spectator, which called it “Perhaps the greatest Tuscan red ever.” It runs close to $200 if you can get it, which is extremely difficult, but if you can it makes a perfect gift. More accessible and less known to wine fans is the excellent Le Serre Nuove, until recently known as the house’s “second wine” and Ornellaia’s younger brother. But production of the already exceptional wine has been upgraded to give it a unique identity, and now grapes that go into Le Serre Nuove hail from the same standout estate vineyards chosen for the flagship. Le Serre Nuove means “the new nursery,” and the wine offers freshness, accessibility, and softness, balanced with the intensity that comes with the estate’s outstanding terroir. The current release is the 2012, a deep ruby and full fruit wine with a velvety feel that got consistently high 92-93 point ratings from top critics such as Robert Parker and Wine Enthusiast ($75).
Macallan Edition No.1: It wouldn’t be a real gift guide without a selection from The Macallan, my favorite single malt Scotch, and by extension, my favorite whisky. I’m hardly alone - The Macallan is the most collectible whisky in the world, and in Scotland, it is considered the standard to which others aspire. I’ve had a lot of the variations in their lineup, and I have never been disappointed, but I haven’t tried this one - it’s new and not out until December. Edition No.1 marks the start of a new limited edition series, to be released annually, showcasing the distillery’s mastery of wood. All of the color and about three quarters of the flavor in whisky comes from the wood in which it is aged, and Macallan has long and famously been at the forefront of using sherry casks, a process that has recently been widely imitated. Each year, a special selection of casks will be chosen to create a new Edition, with the proportions of various cask types hand-selected by master whisky maker, Bob Dalgarno. Edition No.1 is vatted from single malts matured in eight unique European and American oak cask styles and sizes, each contributing their own distinct character. It is both drinkable and collectible and comes in at a surprisingly reasonable price point for a limited edition from the world’s moist vaunted distillery ($90).
Finally, if you want to give a gift to the wine or spirit lover that does not actually contain any booze, especially if you need to carry it or on a plane or ship it easily, consider The Dead Rabbit Drinks Manual. The craft cocktail version of an Irish Pub, this bar in New York’s lower Manhattan was just named the World’s Best Bar at Tales of the Cocktail, the most prestigious such honor. The owners and co-authors hail from Belfast, Northern Ireland, where they also operated a very acclaimed bar and were on the cusp of the resurgent craft cocktail (aka “mixology”) movement. Their drink book is part story, part recipe, and entirely entertaining. It is also brand new (last month), in hardcover with great pictures, and it is highly unlikely the recipient on your gift list has one, no matter how deep their drink library ($27).
Cheers!

Apollo’s moon mission was one of the most expansive government initiatives in American history. During its peak years, some 34,000 NASA employees and 375,000 outside contractors took part in the program. Budget estimates vary, but in 2008, the Congressional Research Service put Apollo’s inflation-adjusted costs at $98 billion—several times more expensive than the Manhattan Project and the equivalent of almost $500 for every man, woman and child living in the United States in 1969.
2. JFK floated the idea of a joint U.S.-Soviet moon mission.

Apollo unfolded during the famous “space race” between the United States and the Soviet Union, but in September 1963, President Kennedy shocked the world by suggesting that the two Cold War foes might join forces for a tandem lunar mission. “In a field where the United States and the Soviet Union have a special capacity—in the field of space—there is room for new cooperation, for further joint efforts in the regulation and exploration of space,” he said in a United Nations speech. “I include among these possibilities a joint expedition to the moon.” The President’s proposal was most likely driven by the soaring costs of the Apollo program and a desire to ease tensions with the Russians. While there is evidence that the Soviets considered the idea, it was abandoned following Kennedy’s November 1963 assassination.
3. Apollo suffered its worst tragedy before it ever left the ground.

On January 27, 1967, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee climbed inside their Apollo 1 spacecraft for a routine prelaunch test. As they sat on the launch pad, a spark from some faulty wiring triggered a massive fire that tore through the cabin’s pure oxygen atmosphere. A complicated latch system on the hatch made it all but impossible for the astronauts to escape, and by the time ground crews finally opened it several minutes later, all three men had died from asphyxiation. The fire marked the first time that American astronauts were killed inside a spacecraft. It grounded Apollo for 18 months, but it also led NASA to make crucial design improvements that increased safety and performance during the lunar missions.
4. The crew of Apollo 7 won an Emmy Award.

Apollo’s first manned mission began in October 1968, when Apollo 7 entered low-Earth orbit to conduct a shakedown of the command and service module. During the 11-day flight, astronauts Wally Schirra, Donn Eisele and Walter Cunningham made the first live television transmissions from inside a manned spacecraft. Billed as coming “from the lovely Apollo room, high atop everything,” the broadcasts treated viewers to tours of the spacecraft, demonstrations of how meals were prepared in zero gravity, and plenty of wisecracks from the crew. The “Wally, Walt and Donn Show” proved to be a massive hit. After returning home, the astronauts were even given a special Emmy Award by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
5. Neil Armstrong wasn’t handpicked to command Apollo 11.

NASA’s Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton adhered to an impartial rotation system for the Apollo missions. Each three-man team of astronauts served as the backup crew on a flight, and then became prime crew of their own mission three flights later. For the first moon landing, however, Slayton considered handpicking a commander. Gus Grissom was the leading candidate before his death in the Apollo 1 fire, and Slayton later informally offered the job to Apollo 8 commander Frank Borman, who turned it down in favor of retiring. In the end, the historic Apollo 11 mission fell to Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins—the next crew in the rotation line. “I wasn’t chosen to be first,” Armstrong later said. “I was just chosen to command that flight, which turned out to be the first landing. Circumstances put me in that particular role.”
6. A bra company designed the Apollo spacesuits.

When Neil Armstrong took his “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” in July 1969, he was wearing a spacesuit crafted by Playtex, a company better known for making ladies’ bras and girdles. The International Latex Corporation—the industrial division of Playtex—won a contract to build Apollo spacesuits in 1962, and later sealed the deal after besting two other companies in a design competition. It went on to create the A7L and A7LB, a pair of hand-sewn spacesuits that protected the Apollo astronauts from the elements while also giving them the freedom of movement required to collect moon rocks, conduct scientific experiments and drive the lunar rover. Playtex’s spacesuit division split off from the main company in 1967, and it continues to serve as a NASA contractor under the name ILC Dover.
7. Apollo 12 was struck by lightning twice during takeoff.

Apollo’s second lunar landing mission took off on November 14, 1969, during a brief lull in a thunderstorm. All went according to plan at first, but just 36 seconds after liftoff, the spacecraft and its roaring Saturn V rocket suffered a lightning strike. Moments later, a second bolt of lightning tore through the ship and wiped out many of its electrical systems. Inside the cockpit, Apollo 12 astronauts Pete Conrad, Alan Bean and Richard Gordon heard the master alarm and saw their instrument panel glow with warning lights. NASA considered aborting the mission, but a young flight controller remembered a method for switching the spacecraft’s Signal Conditioning Equipment to an auxiliary setting, which allowed the crew to reconnect the ship’s fuel cells and bring its navigation platform back online once in orbit. Despite beginning its mission with a near-disaster, Apollo 12 went on to make a successful moon landing.
8. An Apollo astronaut conducted a secret ESP experiment.

During his voyage to the moon and back with Apollo 14, astronaut Edgar Mitchell secretly carried out the space program’s only experiment in extrasensory perception, or ESP. Mitchell had a deep interest in psychological phenomena, and before leaving for the moon, he concocted a test to see if it was possible to transmit his thoughts through space. While his fellow crewmembers Alan Shepard and Stuart Roosa slept, Mitchell took out a collection of cards and spent a few minutes concentrating on a random series of symbols. Back on Earth, a team of psychics tried to read his thoughts and write down the order of the sequence. The group reportedly guessed the right numbers 51 times out of 200, which Mitchell described as “results far exceeding anything expected.” A few years after returning from his moon mission, Mitchell continued his psychic research by founding the Institute of Noetic Sciences, a nonprofit group devoted to studying human consciousness.
9. NASA quarantined astronauts after the first few moon missions.

Armstrong, commander; Michael Collins, command module pilot; and Edwin E. (“Buzz”) Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot. (Credit: NASA)
NASA knew very little about the moon before the Apollo missions—including whether it harbored hazardous microbes or “space germs.” With this in mind, the crews of Apollo 11, 12 and 14 were quarantined after they returned home from their lunar landings. The astronauts were required to slip into anti-contamination suits as soon as they were plucked out of the sea, and they were then sealed off for three weeks inside a converted Airstream trailer called the Mobile Quarantine Facility, or MQF. In the case of Apollo 12, the astronauts were even forced to spend Thanksgiving inside the MQF, so a special turkey dinner was prepared for them. Luckily for the crews of Apollo 15, 16 and 17, NASA later concluded there was no risk of moon diseases and scrapped its quarantine measures in 1971.
10. Apollo 15’s crew left a work of art on the moon.

By the time Apollo 17 ended in 1972, six different lunar expeditions had left the moon’s surface littered with everything from discarded spacecraft parts to scientific experiments and even a photo of astronaut Charlie Duke’s family. Still, the most unusual relic might be “Fallen Astronaut,” an aluminum sculpture designed by Belgian artist Paul van Hoeydonck and secretly left on the moon in August 1971 by Apollo 15 commander David Scott. Scott believed that the minimalist artwork should serve as a memorial to those that had died in the pursuit of space exploration, so he placed it alongside a plaque inscribed with the names of 14 lost American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts.

A holidaying company car driver at Toomey Leasing Group has achieved 990 miles on one tank of fuel from his Insignia 2.0 CDTi SRi VX-Line.
The leasing company already has 20 of the five door models on its company car fleet, used by its sales managers for both personal and professional use.
After using his company Insignia to drive his family of four on a round trip of 3,200 miles from the UK to Naples in Italy, one sales manager, Dino Landico, was able to achieve an average of 59mpg in his Insignia.
“Even with all our luggage, driving the Vauxhall Insignia meant I was able to take my family on holiday without spending a fortune,” explained Landico.
Martin Wroe, managing director of Toomey Leasing Group, said: “Lowering carbon emissions is a key priority for the company, which is one of the reasons behind why we have chosen the Vauxhall Insignia, which has CO2 emissions of just 98g/km, for our company’s fleet.
“As these cars are used by our employees outside of work as well, low fuel consumption is even more important, so it’s very encouraging that we have already received such positive feedback from those who have noticed a difference.
“Since our employees will be using these vehicles at home as well as at work, we needed to choose a model that would be versatile enough for all kinds of situations.”
The cars, which are being used by Toomey Leasing’s team of sales managers to visit clients nationwide, will drive an average of between 15,000 to 35,000 miles per year.
The diesel Insignias have a manual 6-speed transmission, Start/Stop and feature Vauxhall’s satellite navigation system.
Paul Adler, fleet marketing manager at Vauxhall, said: “We’re really pleased to hear how happy Toomey Leasing’s drivers are with the Insignias and we hope they will continue to be impressed by their fuel economy, performance and versatility.”

Star Buys
If you are interested in one of the products listed below then this is the best Black Friday deal you will find on it and it’s the one to buy. Deals are grouped by retailer and deals are/will go live at each product link.
Amazon - Amazon Echo Dot for $29.99 (save $20) - product link - This Echo Dot deal is cheaper than Prime Day’s price of $34.99 and Black Friday’s 2016 Price of $39.99. In fact this is the lowest price ever for the Echo Dot and therefore a Star Buy.
Amazon - Amazon All-New Echo for $79.99 (save $20) - product link - This is a new model, but the original Echo was available for $89.99 on Prime Day 2017 and $139.99 on Black Friday 2016 so it’s better than all previous offers for its predecessor.
Amazon - Amazon Echo Plus for $119.99 (save $30) - product link - This is new for Black Friday 2017 and it’s a very good deal on what will be a red hot product.
Amazon - Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Vo ice Remote for $24.99 (save $15) - product link - A new price low as this bundle was not discounted at all on Prime Day 2017, while it’s previous low was $29.99 on Black Friday last year.
Amazon - Free Amazon Prime Membership Trial - sign-up link - Receive free two-day shipping on most items including those for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This is a must have to get the best access to Amazon Black Friday deals and it can be cancelled with no change inside 30 days letting you get all your holiday sales shopping done first.
Best Buy - Sharp 50-inch LED 2160p Smart 4K Ultra HD Roku TV for $179.99 (save $320) - product link - This is not only the best TV deal so far, but in my opinion it is also the top deal overall for Black Friday 2017. On Black Friday last year, Best Buy offered a 49-inch Toshiba 4k HD TV for only $199.99. This year's deal is an inch larger and $20 less expensive. This deal will not be available online.
Best Buy - Save $350 on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8 Plus with qualified activation - product link - Target is offering the same deal but with a $300 gift card. Best Buy's direct savings of $350 is a better deal and offers more flexibility for those who may not want the limitations a gift card brings. It appears that Best Buy recently increased this offer too from $300 (as seen in the ad) to $350, it’s the best Samsung Galaxy smartphone Black Friday deal out there.
Best Buy - Toshiba 55-inch Class LED 2160p w/ Chromecast 4K Ultra HD TV for $279.99 (save $220) - product link - This in-store only Toshiba 55-inch 4K TV deal combines a great discount with a quality set. It also has very good reviews.
Kohl's - Haier 55-inch 4K Ultra HDTV + $90 Kohl's Cash for $299.99 (save $100) - product link - A 55-inch 4K Ultra HDTV for under $300 is fantastic and the $90 Kohl’s Cash means a net price of only $210! This is my second favorite 55-inch HDTV deal of the year only behind Best Buy’s Toshiba 55-inch Class LED 2160p w/Chromecast 4K Ultra HD TV for $279.99 listed above.
Kohl's - Microsoft Xbox One S 500GB Console + $45 Kohl's Cash for $189.99 (save $90) - product link - Best Buy and Walmart are both selling the Xbox One S 500GB Console for $189 with no incentive. Target has the same $189 price with a $25 gift card but Kohl’s offer of $45 Kohl’s Cash again makes it the clear top dog. It’s the best Black Friday Xbox One S deal.
Kohl's - Sony PlayStation 4 1TB Console + $60 Kohl's Cash for $199.99 (save $100) - product link - The $199 price mark for the PS4 1TB Console is the same price offered at rivals Target, Best Buy and Walmart, but the $60 Kohl’s Cash really sets this deal apart and makes it a no brainer. Again this ranks as the best Black Friday 2017 PS4 deal.
Kohl's - LG 49-inch 4K UHD HDR Smart LED TV (LGK-49UJ6300) + $120 Kohl's Cash for $399.99 (save $300) - product link - LG is a quality brand this is a good price, but it is the $120 in Kohl’s Cash which makes it a Star Buy. While other 49/50-inch 4K TVs are cheaper, this is arguably the best in terms of quality.
Walmart - Free $300 Walmart Gift Card with purchase of Apple’s iPhone X, iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus - product link - Walmart is the only store offering a $300 gift card for an iPhone X purchase. This is a Star Buy and the Best Black Friday 2017 iPhones deal.
Walmart - Google Home Mini + $25 Shopping Offer for $29 (save $20) - product link - Many other stores are offering the Google Home Mini for the same $29, but the benefit of buying at Walmart is it includes a $25 Shopping offer towards a future order when bought through Google Express. With this included the net purchase price is a crazy $4.

Walmart - Google Home + $25 Shopping Offer for $79 (save $50) - product link - Many other stores are again matching Walmart’s price but another $25 voucher offer for purchasing through Google Express makes the net purchase price an unmatched $54.
Walmart - Sharp 55-inch Class 4K (2160P) Smart LED TV (LC-55P6000U) for $298 - product link - Other stores are offering cheaper 55-inch 4K TVs on Black Friday this year, but what makes this stand out is the brand and quality. Found on the first page of Walmart's ad, it is Walmart’s featured Black Friday 2017 deal.
Target - Target REDcard - sign-up link - REDcard holders receive 5% off already low prices for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s an essential purchase if you plan on doing any holiday sales shopping at Target.
Target - Beats urBeats Earbuds for $49.99 (save $50) - product link - Very popular earbuds with 50% off and I can almost guarantee they will only be available in limited quantities. Star Buy if you land a pair.
Samsung.com - Save up to $400 with an eligible smartphone trade-in when you buy a Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8 - product link - This is the best Black Friday 2017 trade-in offer.
Black Friday Monday TV tip: always check the specific TV model when retailers release their deals, particularly Amazon which often hides this until the last minute. Remember even the best manufacturers have weak models in their line-up so do your research before buying.
Target
Solid Deals
Remember this is a Best Of roundup so to make it into the Solid Deals category, it’s a high quality discount you should strongly consider. Again all deals are/will go live at each product link:
Amazon - Amazon Tap for $79.99 (save $50) - product link - The Tap was available for $79.99 on Prime Day 2017, so the price is being matched here, but it is a popular product and it was $89.99 for Black Friday last year.
Amazon - Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition for $69.99 (save $30) - product link - Another deal which is no better than the Amazon Prime Day 2017 listing, but it is cost $74.99 on Black Friday last year.
Amazon - Amazon Fire HD 8 for $49.99 (save $30) - product link - As above, a match for Amazon Prime Day 2017, but this time $10 cheaper than last year’s Black Friday.
Amazon - Amazon Kindle Paperwhite for $89.99 (save $30) - product link - Another Amazon Prime Day match, but again $10 cheaper than it was during Black Friday last year.
Amazon - Amazon Kindle for $49.99 (save $30) - product link - The original Amazon Kindle was available for $49.99 on Prime Day 2017 and Black Friday 2016 so while this remains a good price, it is a familiar one.
Best Buy - Insignia 32-inch Class LED 720p Smart Roku TV for $129.99 (save $50) - product link - Not a bad price for a 32-inch Roku TV. The brand is average but the integration of Roku’s popular platform at this price makes it a solid deal.
Kohl’s - Apple Watch Series 3 + $90 Kohl's Cash for $329 (no direct discount) - product link - No direct discount here so I cannot rate this a star buy. But, the $90 Kohl’s Cash makes it a very solid deal.
Target - Westinghouse 55-inch 4K Smart UHD TV - $249.99 (in-store only) - product link - This is the cheapest price for a 55-inch 4K TV this year and one of the cheapest that I have seen. Unfortunately for online shoppers, this deal is in-store only and it isn’t a premium brand. But you are still getting a lot of HDTV for your money.
Target - Polaroid 32-inch LED TV for $89.99 (save $40) - product link - This will not be the cheapest 32-inch TV this year (Amazon has one for $69.99 but is withholding the brand), still $89.99 is still a very low price for a set of this size.
Walmart - Element 39-inch Class HD (720P) Smart LED TV for $125 - product link - Walmart has the cheapest Black Friday deal of the year for a 39-inch TV. This is not a premium HDTV, but the price is solid.
Walmart - Apple iPad 32GB Wi-Fi (5th Generation) for $249 (save $80) - product link - Good discounts on Apple products are rare, but this is a good deal for a popular iPad model. It isn’t exclusive, Target offers the deal at $249.99, but you’re still pocketing an extra dollar if you buy it at Walmart.
Walmart - PlayStation 4 GranTurismo Sport VR Bundle for $299 (save $100) - product link - Released earlier this month, the Playstation 4 GranTurismo Sport VR Bundle is already on sale for $299 at Walmart. While many other stores have this same deal, Walmart's price follows a familiar theme being $0.99 less than competing stores.
Best Buy
Treat With Caution
Black Friday is perhaps as famous for its dodgy deals as its acclaimed discounts and it can be easy get duped by misleading savings or a fire sale on a bad product. You would have to desperately want one of these specific deals to buy it:
Amazon - Amazon Cloud Cam for $99.99 (save $20) - product link - Decent price but reviews are very poor. Wait for the next generation model. Instead I'd suggest you check out this dedicated Black Friday camera guide for better options.
Amazon - 32-inch 720p TV (brand unknown) for $69.99 - product link - While this is a great price for a 32-inch TV, the model number is not listed, which makes it impossible to rate. It is very likely to be from a no-name brand and the quality will be subpar. Amazon is also not saying when it will go on sale, which means this TV is going to be tough to get with the limited quantities which risks buyers rushing to secure an unknown model.
Amazon - 49-inch 4K TV (brand unknown) for $159.99 - product link - As above, nothing is known about this TV. While $159.99 is a steal for a 49-inch 4K TV, this carries all the same risks and Amazon has not announced when it will go on sale or in what quantities.
Walmart - Sony PlayStation 4 1TB for $199 (save $100) - product link - This is a similar discount to most stores this Black Friday, so why should you should steer clear? Because BJ's Wholesale Club and Costco list it for $189 (membership required) while the standout deal is Kohl's which is offering the same deal but with $60 in Kohl's Cash for free. That’s the deal to buy.
Target - Free $250 Gift Card With Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus With Activation - product link - Not a bad deal in isolation, but Walmart is offering a $300 gift card with the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus on activation. There is no reason to sacrifice the additional $50 in gift card credit.
Black Friday 2017 is going to be the biggest Black Friday in history. Some stores have even had deals running since the start of November. But all the very best deals are still available now and many only launch on Black Friday itself. Amazon, Best Buy, Kohl’s and Walmart are leading the pack this year and I give particular praise to Kohl’s with its incredible Kohl’s Cash deals.

If you missed Mark Zuckerberg’s rather awkward D8 interview, Kara Swisher is one tough cookie after all, you missed a rather bizzare episode involving Mark’s clothes.
Upon being scolded into removing his sweatshirt, the Facebook CEO stated that it was a ‘company’ garment, with their ‘mission’ printed in it. The diagram to be found inside was odd enough that Swisher mentioned that it reminded her of the Illuminati. Things like this just keep happening to poor Mark.
The crowd was bemused. The fine folks over at SFWeekly took the time to make a mock-up of the imprinted diagram, take a look:
When you get a good look at it, it is hardly anything to fret over, but to have found it by accident on stage was a bit much. Still, Facebook could use any good PR at the moment to make the corporation seem as open as they like their user’s data. This is not going to help.

Easter Eggs of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge – An Exhaustive Guide to Hidden References, In-Jokes, and Hidden Mickeys
Now that Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has been open to guests (who have pre-booked reservations) for a full week at Disneyland, we’ve had some time to explore the amazingly detailed new land and drink in many of the intricate design elements, taking note of any hidden (and sometimes not-so-hidden) references or in-jokes we spotted along the way.
With that in mind, it’s time to begin putting together an ever-growing list of these clever allusions to both Star Wars and Disney theme park history, a task that may never be fully complete, considering Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge is essentially constructed from the ground up with wall-to-wall Easter Eggs. My plan is to regularly update this list from my own observations and via information we receive from the community.
RESISTANCE BASE

Fleet customers looking for a more exciting Vauxhall Insignia will be pleased to know the new GSI is available with a diesel engine.
By bolting an extra turbo onto the existing 2.0-litre 170PS unit, Vauxhall has boosted power to 207PS.
As a result it can accelerate to 60MPH in just 7.3 seconds. Fuel consumption is rated at 40.4mpg with CO2 emissions of 186g/km.
Prices start at £32,975 for the Grand Sport hatch or £1,500 more for the Sports Tourer.
A more powerful petrol version is also available from £33,375 with 260PS and CO2 emissions of 197g/km.
The GSi has a new eight-speed automatic gearbox, operated via a paddle-shift on the steering wheel. It uses an all-wheel-drive system and promises an engaging drive.
It is the fastest Vauxhall yet around Germany’s Nürburgring, where much of its chassis development was carried out, and is a full 12 seconds quicker than the outgoing Insignia VXR.
The suspension is lowered by 10mm and the car features 20-inch alloy wheels and Brembo brakes.
Exterior design updates include chrome air intakes at the front and a rear spoiler, while on the inside full-leather sports seats, a leather sports steering wheel and aluminium pedals complete the package.
Unique to the GSi, the seats offer ventilation, heating, massage and adjustable side bolsters.
It also comes packed with Onstar, LED headlights, keyless entry and sat nav.

As students from elementary age to grad level across the country head back to school this month, parents are grappling with how to pay tuition, buy school supplies, and fit in all of those extracurricular activities. It can be difficult to sort it all out, and in an era where everyone seems to have an opinion about school (and paying for it), it can be even more difficult to separate fact from fiction. In my Back To School Myths series, I’ll help you sort out truths from myths when it comes to school and taxes. Today’s myth: School uniforms are deductible.
School uniforms are not deductible. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not allow a deduction for school uniforms for public, parochial or private schools. It does not matter if uniforms are required. It does not matter if they are expensive. And it does not matter if the uniforms are so atrocious that your child would never, ever wear them outside of school.
If you are a student at a military school, uniforms are still not deductible – that’s consistent with the rules for public, parochial and private schools. However, you used to be able to deduct the cost of articles not replacing regular clothing, including insignia, shoulder boards, epaulets, and related items. Relatedly, civilian faculty or staff members of a military school used to be able to deduct the cost of uniforms not intended to be worn outside of the classroom as an unreimbursed job expense. Those deductions were previously available to taxpayers who itemized on Schedule A at line 21. However, unreimbursed job expenses - that’s what is reported on line 21 - were eliminated as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).
(You can see what Schedule A might look like here.)
While the IRS won’t allow a tax break for school uniforms, that’s not the case in every state. At least one state, Louisiana, allows a deduction for the cost of school uniforms required by the school for general day-to-day use. Check with your tax professional to find out more about the rules in your state.

That said, even if you can’t deduct the cost of school uniforms, you may still be able to catch a tax break. Funds in a Coverdell Educational Savings Account (ESA) may be used to pay for school uniforms if the uniforms are required or provided by an eligible elementary or secondary school in connection with attendance or enrollment at the school. With a Coverdell ESA, money grows tax-free inside the plan until you take it out to pay qualified education expenses, including uniforms, for a designated beneficiary. There’s no limit on the number of folks who can make contributions on behalf of a beneficiary, but the total contributions for any beneficiary cannot exceed $2,000 in one year (income restrictions apply). Contributions aren't deductible for federal purposes, but some states may allow you to deduct contributions for state tax purposes.
Bottom line: School uniforms aren’t deductible for federal income tax purposes - but there still may be tax advantageous ways to pay for them. To find out more, ask your tax professional or financial advisor.

Android is one of the most used platforms in the world thanks to it's performance and user friendly design, but no matter the quality of the software or hardware, a device is going to start to slow down after some time. We're going to show you how to inject some life back into your Android smartphone or tablet with our handy guide.
Before we begin, every situation involving a slow Android device is going to be different so we're going to cover a number of ways in which you can speed things up. You can try them all or the ones which apply to you.
How to find out what is slowing down your Android device
While you can just jump to the steps below, we're going to show you how to see exactly what is taking up the resources on your Android device. This will give you an idea on what exactly is slowing you phone down to make your clean up as efficient as possible.
The Trepn Profiler which is produced by Qualcomm themselves will allow you to see the real-time usage of your CPU, a snapshot of the network traffic for your data/wifi, and will also show you the load on your GPU and RAM.
Head into the app store and download the app, fire it up and take a look at what exactly is slowing your phone down.
How to speed up Android: Delete unused apps
A common cause of a slow Android smartphone or tablet is that you've filled it up with app, many of which you probably downloaded on a whim and don't actually use. Like a PC, your Android device will slow down if it's become bloated with applications.
Our advice to start with is to go through all your installed apps and pick out ones which you don't use to free up some space. Remember to uninstall them fully rather than just remove the icon from your homescreen.
With more available space on your Android device, things should run smoother.
How to speed up Android: Get rid of media
The next thing to cull on your Android smartphone or tablet is media. In the same way that apps can easily take up a lot of space, music, photos and videos do the same – even more so if you're shooting 4K video regularly or keeping your entire music library stored on your device.
To speed up your Android device, trawl through all the media you have and get rid of anything you can to create more space. Perhaps videos you've transferred to your PC or photos you've taken multiple times.
How to speed up Android: Remove widgets
Widgets are a great feature of Android but they take more processing power to run compared to simply displaying an icon.
If you're using a lot across multiple homescreens, consider which ones you don't use much or could do without. Having fewer will lighten the load on your Android device and help speed it up.
How to speed up Android: Clear your RAM with an app manager
Android will automatically kill apps if it needs memory which isn't being used wisely but you can still have a user effect on what's going on in the background. For starters, you can simply open recent apps and clear anything you're not using by swiping it off the screen.
Furthermore, you can go into the settings and see what's using up all your memory; go to settings > apps > running. This may be different depending on your device so also look for an application manager or smart manager. Apps using the memory or cache isn't necessarily a bad thing, things are done like this to avoid loading everything each time you open an app.
However, you can often speed up your Android device by stopping an app or clearing the memory entirely. Although there are tools built into Android for app management, there are some apps which you can download from the Play store such as Advanced Task Killer.
How to speed up Android: Reboot
It's the classic 'have you tried turning it off and on again' but it really does still work for most technology. A good old fashioned reboot is likely to help you out if things are feeling sluggish, at least for a while. If it only sorts out the problem briefly then you'll need to take more drastic action.
How to speed up Android: Factory reset
If all else fails then we recommend trying a complete factory reset of your device. It's not ideal but a clean slate might be just what you need if you really can't figure out why your Android device is so slow. You'll need to re-download apps and the like and make sure you backup any data, such as photos, that you don't want to be gone forever.

In an interesting bit of deduction on the part of some fans, it seems that with recent events concerning Goku Black in Dragon Ball Super there’s a chance that the story may be connected with the upcoming game Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
While the following is conjecture based on information currently present in both Super and Xenoverse 2, if you are of the disposition that finds spoilers in any form an anathema to your being, then avert your eyes.
The reasoning behind this potential narrative connection is twofold. With Future Trunks now back in the past, some are thinking that the Trunks in Xenoverse is in fact the same one and part of the new Time Patrol.
What potentially backs that up is the insignia on Goku Black’s time ring (shown above). The time ring allows Goku Black to travel through time, as well as forcibly returns him to the future. Now, while neither Towa nor Mira had a similar time ring in Xenoverse, they did travel through time in order to change events to their advantage.
In the latest Xenoverse 2 trailer (show below), both evil Janemba and evil Broly have a strange insignia on their heads. While it isn’t precisely the same as the one on Black Goku’s time ring, it is remarkably similar.
What with Black Goku’s constant comments about him hating Saiyans and that the body he inhabits is a potentially powerful one, not to mention his mysterious black ki, it feels like we might be dealing with something that's taken on Goku's form and is probably from the Demon Realm.
Considering the story in the first Xenoverse and its focus on time traveling demons, all this fits rather neatly into the realization that the stories of both Super and Xenoverse 2 could be directly connected.
Like I initially said, this is all conjecture at this point but there are quite a few coincidences at play here that help to clarify what might be happening between Super and Xenoverse 2. Personally, I wouldn’t put it past Akira Toriyama to come up with something like this.
I guess over the coming months we’ll get to find out more about this potential connection as well as Goku Black’s obviously mysterious origins.
Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is released on PS4, Xbox One and PC on October 25th in the US and October 28th in Europe. Dragon Ball Super is currently airing on Japanese television and there are no details yet on a Western release.

What’s the Buzz? It’s all happening at the museum, honey.
One of the highlights of our Oceania cruise was the special Canyon Ranch excursion to visit the special honey museum and apiary in the province of Cadiz, Spain. The tour was part of the all-new, unprecedented Canyon Ranch SpaClub excursions that Oceania has just introduced, and as guests of the Insignia, we were delighted to be on this first-ever outing as it made its debut. It was such a wonderful time that we are sure that other guests are going to line up to take this tour and the others that are being offered cruise-wide on the other ships as well – including, for example, a visit to the Roman baths in Civitavecchia, and another that includes yoga on the cliffs of Monaco. On board, you can experience a complementary spa service in the form of a “Naturally Nourishing Ritual,” consisting of a cleansing with organic milk; exfoliation with peat enzymes and antioxidant-rich Arctic cloudberries; a mushroom wrap; and massage with Arctic berry extracts.
Our tour started in Seville, where the Insignia was docked, and we drove for about one hour, passing fields and fields of tall sunflowers, as we made our way to Jerez. Our destination was the Museo de la Miel (Museum of honey) at Rancho Cortesano, located in an area that is one of the three legs of the “golden triangle of sherry” that is famous in Spain. Kids especially love visiting the museum, said our tour guide Claudio. “The museum is not a common cruise-ship excursion except for some Disney cruises and their focus on children.” We arrived, breathed in deeply as we walked by the rosemary bushes, and walked into the main building.
Debbi Kickham
The museum has been cared for by the same owners – the Garcia Fernandez family – for more than 25 years. The first thing we did was attend a special slide presentation that showcased all the benefits of honey, highlighting its antibacterial properties, cell regeneration, wound-healing, and its ability to boost your immune system. This was a great class at the Bee-school. We learned that the Queen of the beehive can live up to four or five years, and that there are typically 40,000 to 80,000 bees in one hive. We also learned that the Greeks were early proponents of propolis – thus, if any of you are familiar with the cosmetic brand “Apivita,” you know that it is made from honeybees.
Debbi Kickham
Next, while the roosters around us were crowing, we donned beekeeping suits so that we could visit the hives. The minute we approached them we could hear them swarming inside. The beekeeper made a small fire of eucalyptus leaves; the smoke signals to the bees that there is a danger of fire, and thus, they begin eating, eating, eating – and then, calming down and feeling sleepy like most of us after a meal. This is the perfect time to open the hives and get the honey. We all were able to hold up a hive swarming with bees, and only one of us got stung.
Next, we went inside to the vegetarian restaurant on the premises, which is famous for offering a wealth of its own fruits and vegetables that are grown right here on the property. Here we sampled six varieties of honeys, including bee pollen, which some say is a superfood that is loaded with protein. Indeed, the little round balls of pollen tasted substantial, and were perfect to mix into our smoothies made with honey, beets, carrots, lemon and ginger.
Then came, for me, the most fun part – viewing and shopping for the lotions and potions made from the honey. The apiary produces a terrific lemon lotion infused with its honey, for the low cost of about 3 Euro per tube – the perfect souvenir! You can also purchase face cream, soaps, honey lozenges infused with rosemary or ginger or cinnamon, as well as other goodies such as chocolate bars made with honey. On property, in keeping with the Canyon Ranch spa theme, you can also enjoy a honey facial, massage, or scrub, for the low cost of about 30 Euro per treatment. How sweet it is!

Getting certified as a woman-owned business takes grit and tenacity. But it can potentially help land women entrepreneurs more business opportunities and government contracts.
“It’s a grueling process,” said Michele Burchfield, co-founder of Blume Honey Water, a Pittsburgh-based company, when describing getting her business certified by the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), the largest certifier of women-owned businesses or women’s business enterprises, in the U.S. “But we got through it just in time to put the logo on our label. And many companies, such as Target and Starbucks, have initiatives to work with WBENC-certified companies.”
Having the certification, Burchfield said, has helped Blume Honey Water ramp up sales and open doors at retailers and will do so in the future. Certification can also help women entrepreneurs tap resources offered by the group behind the insignia, including networking events and executive education programs.
The Payoff For Getting Certified
The effort to get certified, while difficult, has the prospective to pay back the effort in spades. “The pros are increased visibility,” said Donna M. De Carolis, dean of the Charles D. Close School of Entrepreneurship at Drexel University and a member of the editorial board of EIX, the Entrepreneurial and Innovation Exchange, a social media learning platform funded by the Schulze Family Foundation.
Also on Forbes:
“Most public corporations as well as local, state, and federal government purchasing agencies have programs for allotting a certain percentage of business to women-owned companies,” said De Carolis.
The U.S. government intentionaly looks for women-owned businesses to award specially-designated government contracts.
“The federal government has a statutory goal of awarding 5% of eligible prime contracting dollars to women-owned small businesses,” said Carla Harris, chair of the National Women’s Business Council (NWBC), a nonpartisan federal group that advises the President, Congress and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) on economic issues important to women business owners. “Since the establishment of this goal in 1994, it wasn’t until two years ago that it first met its goal — and it missed it in 2016.”
Large companies and government agencies will send out a request for proposal to submit business proposals and contracts through organizations like the National Association of Women Business Owners (NWBOC) and the WBENC. Then, certified companies receive an email blast about upcoming project opportunities.
Who Qualifies for Certification
So who qualifies for women-owned certification and how do you get the designation?
In general, women-owned businesses are ones at least 51% controlled by women who are U.S. citizens. A woman (or women) must manage the day-to-day operations and a woman must the hold the highest officer position in the business and work at the business full-time. A woman and a man can own the company jointly, but the woman must be the majority owner and demonstrate her management and control of the company.
If you’d like to apply for certification as a woman-owned business, have patience. De Carolis said it’s a “lengthy application process, which in some instances can take up to a year.” The WBENC’s website says its processing time is generally 90 days from the date all documentation has been received.
Another potential downside: “Some women are worried about only being seen as a woman-run business, and not being taken as seriously as a man in the same industry,” De Carolis said.
I say: Get over it. There’s no reason to pass up a marketplace that may have a vested interest in working with you.
Admittedly, the sheer number of types of certification can make your head twirl. They range from self-certification to state certification. De Carolis’ advice: “Investigate the type of certification you seek as it relates to your business and potential customers.”
4 Major Types of Women-Owned Business Certification
For the sake of simplicity, I am just going to mention four types of certification for women business owners:
The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) designation. It’s best if you’re aiming to score federal contracts. The SBA’s process is pretty simple, De Carolis said.
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise certification or DBE, is a federal designation performed by the state and applies to contracts through the U.S. Department of Transportation. If federal money is involved for a Department of Transportation contract, the state must include women at a pre-determined level. This certification presumes certain groups are disadvantaged, including women, black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian-Pacific Americans or other minorities.
Then there’s the nonprofit Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) program to get certified. WBENC certification is accepted by more than 1,000 corporations, plus many federal, state and local government entities. WBENC is also an approved third-party certifier for the Women-Owned Small Business federal contracting program through the SBA.
There are no size or length-of-time in business requirements here, but you’ll need to pull together a wide range of paperwork and have an in-person interview to vet your company.
“Certification is the foundation of what we do,” said Pamela Prince-Eason, WBENC president and CEO. “We view certification as a catalyst for business growth and a key stepping stone for women in building a successful business. It opens doors to new business opportunities and provides access to hundreds of potential corporate and government clients, as well as a network of thousands of fellow female entrepreneurs.”
The National Woman Business Owners Corporation (NWBOC) also has a national certification program. Its requirements are similar to those of WBENC. The group provides certified businesses with a mentoring program and training opportunities.
Federal vs. State Certification
In addition to private third-party certifiers like the WBENC and NWBOC, several state and local agencies offer certification programs.
Generally speaking, if you are looking to do business in the private sector, national certificates are the route to take. But if you are aiming to do business with, say, the local medical center in your town, you might check to see if there’s a city agency that certifies women-owned businesses.
Once you score the certification, broadcast the news far and wide. Showcase that you’re are a certified women-owned enterprise on your website and in your marketing and promotional materials.
Every little edge helps.

Story 200
By Julio-Cesar Chavez
EL PASO, June 23 (Reuters) - A member of an armed group known for stopping migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border has been arrested after authorities charged him with impersonating a U.S. Border Patrol agent, according to court documents.
Jim Benvie, spokesman for the Guardian Patriots, who have been camped at the border near Sunland Park, New Mexico, was arrested on Friday in Oklahoma after a warrant was issued on Wednesday in southern New Mexico.
The U.S. Department of Justice filed two federal charges, alleging that Benvie, 44, passed himself off as a Border Patrol agent in mid April.
It was the second arrest to target members of armed groups that since February have been patrolling the border near Sunland Park. The groups say they are trying to help overwhelmed Border Patrol agents deal with a surge in arrivals of Central American migrant families.
News photographs of Benvie taken in March showed him wearing a camouflage jacket with a badge reading "Fugitive Recovery Agent" and a patch with an eagle-head insignia.
In Reuters interviews earlier this year, he denied his group posed as Border Patrol agents and said he was a citizen journalist documenting proof of the need for the border wall promised by U.S. President Donald Trump.
William Early, an Oklahoma public defender representing Benvie, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Benvie remains in federal custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday in Oklahoma before his full trial begins in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
He also faces a fraud charge in Oklahoma for allegedly running a child-cancer charity scam.
In May, the Guardian Patriots split from another armed group on the border, the United Constitutional Patriots (UCP).
Larry Hopkins, the leader of the UCP, was arrested in April on charges of being a felon in possession of firearms.
At the time, the American Civil Liberties Union described the UCP as a "fascist militia" and said its members were illegally detaining migrants at gunpoint. (Reporting by Julio-Cesar Chavez in El Paso; Writing by Andrew Hay; Editing by Daniel Wallis)

A massive 129 cars available to buy exceed the standard size of a UK parking space. As car sizes grow, even family cars such as the Ford Mondeo, Volvo XC90 and Audi A6 are too long. And the Mercedes-Benz S-class Hybrid and Nissan Navara (2005-2015) pickup truck overhang spaces by around half a metre.
A standard UK parking bay size is 16ft x 8ft (4.8m x 2.4m), which has stood the test of time over the decades. But no longer.
Popular cars considerably too long also include the latest Land Rover Range Rover, Tesla Model S, Jaguar XF, Volvo V90, BMW 5-series, Vauxhall Insignia (2009-2017) and BMW X6.
No car is too wide for a parking space, but the Land Rover Discovery Sport and Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupé give you little more than 30cm to get out of the car if a similarly wide car is parked next door (excluding the wing mirrors).

Which cars are the biggest?
In the graphic below, we have selected two of the longest cars currently in production – the Mercedes-Benz S-class Hybrid and Jaguar XJ. Both will overhang a parking space by far, even when parked right up to the front of the space.
Some mainstream family cars are creeping up in length, too, with the latest-generation Ford Mondeo now being 7.1cm too long.
What you need to know about parking spaces
Disabled spaces typically have an extra 1.2 metres hashed area around the size of a standard parking space.
As average car sizes continue to grow, with SUVs and crossovers getting ever more popular, car parks are beginning to introduce wider bays and marked pedestrian spaces when they are refurbished over time.
The British Parking Association (BPA) told us that multi-storey car parks provide particular challenges to growing car sizes, as they’re not easily adaptable and re-building is too costly.
The BPA adds: ‘A good car park will have the right balance of capacity and efficiency as cramming in lots of small bays is obviously counter-productive.’
Cars too long for standard parking spaces
Below we have selected some of the worst offenders – cars currently in production that are too long for a typical parking space, and others that are so wide it will be tricky to open the doors. And that’s assuming everyone parks perfectly in their parking spaces as well.
No car is too wide for a typical parking space, but with the Land Rover Discovery Sport giving you little more than a capped Bic pen’s length to get out if parked next to a wall, it would be impossible to get out.
If you’re parked next to a similarly large car, you’ll still have little more than 30cm – meaning you’ll have a high risk of getting a nasty scratch. Our width measurements are for the car’s body width – so you won’t get extra leeway by folding in the wing mirrors.

Mercedes-Benz S-Class Hybrid
The hybrid version of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class luxury saloon is a massive 44.6cm too long for a standard UK parking space, meaning you’ll be overhanging by around half a metre when you park. Not only does this risk expensive scratches from other cars passing by, it will make navigating many UK car parks a challenge, as they simply weren’t designed for cars this long.
Nevertheless, the specification of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class Hybrid looks truly impressive – Mercedes claims this saloon has a fuel economy of more than 100mpg and CO2 emissions of just 65g/km, without sacrificing impressive performance and a fun drive. We put it through our expert independent lab tests to see whether it delivers.
Find out whether this is car worth considering, despite its length, in our Mercedes-Benz S-class Hybrid review.
Jaguar XJ
There’s no way you’ll be able to hide the Jaguar XJ’s excess length. At 32.2cm too long for a standard parking space, you’ll have an overhang of more than a foot – no matter how perfectly you park.
The Jaguar XJ is an icon of British cars. But while the 1968 Jaguar XJ defined the traditional Jaguar saloon look for more than four decades, the latest XJ looks nothing like the original. Nor does it look like Mercedes, BMW or Audi rivals, as Jaguar begins a fresh start for the XJ.
Nevertheless, stylish looks remain and there’s plenty of V8 power under the hood.
Find out whether this is a car worth considering, regardless of size, in our expert Jaguar XJ review.
Land Rover Range Rover
Another luxury British icon, the fourth-generation Land Rover Range Rover is 19.9cm too long – around the length of a standard-size brick. By comparison, the older Land Rover Range Rover Sport (2005-2013) was shorter than a typical parking space by 1.2cm.
Land Rover brought in major changes after the 2002-2012 Range Rover model was criticised for its lumbering handling, with the latest model sporting a sleeker profile and a massive weight reduction.
Sporting the world’s first all-aluminium-bodied SUV, the current Range Rover is 420kg lighter – nearly half a tonne. The move to a V6 engine with a 258bhp TDV6 diesel has the potential to have done wonders for the fuel economy.
See whether the major changes have revitalised the Range Rover and made it a car worth buying in our comprehensive Land Rover Range Rover review.
Ford Mondeo
It’s not only expensive luxury cars that are now too long for typical parking spaces – even mainstream family cars are creeping up in length. The previous generation Ford Mondeo (2007 to 2014) was 4.4cm too long, and now the latest Ford Mondeo is 7.1cm too long.
This makes it just that little bit harder to park – especially with its unwieldy 12-metre wide turning circle.
The Ford Mondeo has long been seen as an ideal choice for a practical family car. There’s enough room for five adults, plus a huge boot as well.
Diesel and petrol EcoBoost engine options are available, with most models having a choice of six-speed manual or dual-clutch automatic gearboxes. and there’s a Ford Mondeo hybrid option available as well.
Could this be your ideal family car? We leave no stone unturned in our definitive Ford Mondeo review.
Cars where you’ll struggle to open the doors
Land Rover Discovery Sport
Length is not the only problem for parking modern cars. The Land Rover Discovery Sport gives you only 16.55cm clearance each side for the space – little more than a capped Bic pen – and that’s assuming you’ve parked perfectly.
You won’t be able to get out if parked next to a wall, and it will be a challenge with a similarly sized car parked alongside.
Replacing the Land Rover Freelander, the Land Rover Discovery Sport has moved further upmarket. Its high-end design and premium cabin provides a classier experience.
Nevertheless, you still get a proper Land Rover off-roader SUV with four-wheel drive as standard. In the UK, the only engine option is a 2.0-litre turbocharged diesel.
If you don’t mind searching for a hatchback to park next to, see what we thought of the Land Rover Discovery Sport in our exclusive review.
Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe
The Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupé may be luxury inside, but this giant coupé isn’t a luxury to park. Not only does it give you a not-so-generous 19.85cm room for a standard parking space each side – about the width of a piece of A4 paper – it’s long as well. It exceeds the length of a typical space by 10cm.
Following in the footsteps of rival BMW’s X6, Mercedes has given its GLE SUV the sporting treatment – a trend which has produced some enormous cars.
There’s room for five adults and a large boot, and it’s agile too, with various diesel and petrol engine options, including an AMG version with a cool 577bhp of power.
All have four-wheel drive as standard.
See whether the size is worth it in our Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupé review.
BMW X6
With BMW’s big car trend-setting upmarket sporty SUV coupé, you only have 20.55cm to get out each side – plus this massive SUV is 10.9cm too long for the space as well.
Based on the also-large BMW X5 SUV, the X6 combines a rugged full size 4×4 with a dynamic chassis and performance that has proved a winning combination with buyers.
For engines, there’s a choice of 3.0-litre diesels with 258hp, 313hp or (in M50d form) 381hp and 4.4-litre V8 petrols with 450hp and 575hp. All are four-wheel drive.
Is the potential difficulty of parking it worth it? We reveal all in our expert BMW X6 review.
Which cars are too big?
Below is the full list of cars that are too long for a standard 16ft x 8ft (4.8m x 2.4m) UK parking space, and also cars so wide you’ll struggle to open the doors. We list all cars more than 5cm too long for a standard-size space.

Story 202
Virtually every law enforcement agency in the U.S. issues to its sworn personnel an identification card bearing the name, photograph and title of the officer. Officers use the cards for identification primarily when out of uniform or off-duty. ID cards are often used for access to a courthouse or government building, attending training where sensitive information is being disseminated, flying on a commercial airliner while armed, working with officers and agents from other law enforcement agencies and conducting enforcement activities such as arrests and searches or when approaching a witness or suspect.
The problem
I want you to do something. Take your ID out and look at it. Now here are some questions: Where was it made? How is the design? Do you think it is secure? Does your license from the state have more security features? Do you know what the license security features are?
Let me guess those answers in order: No idea. Terrible. No. Yes. Yes.
Here is a follow-up question: What does the ID of the police department two cities away look like? Have you ever seen it and would you have any idea if it was “real” if someone showed it to you? For the majority of the country I am guessing the answer is that you have no idea what other police department credentials are supposed to look like. An officer has no way to immediately verify an ID by viewing it. Many are made by a regular printer anyone can buy or over at the local college because they have a printer that prints on cards and you don’t.
Now a few of you are saying, “Yeah, but I can tell if the person is a cop just by talking to them.” While this is true much of the time, someone who is brave and acts the part could easily slip by at an event, training, or entering a building. Social engineering is a common and growing way for people to obtain information by telephone or in person; this is often seen in hacking cases. This concept applies to this discussion.
Many police executives and tactics instructors believe the percentage of police officers carrying firearms off-duty is rising. At the same time, many private and public venues have installed metal detectors or have equipped their security employees with wands to detect weapons. Some of these employees receive minimal training and are unsure what to do when they encounter someone who purports to be an armed law enforcement officer.
Now that we have identified the problem, we can discuss some solutions. One state in particular had been trying to tackle this issue for years and recently had a breakthrough that other states might consider.
East Coast IDs
Massachusetts police officers now carry identification cards that are uniform in design and have security features to thwart tampering and counterfeiting. To the author’s knowledge, Massachusetts was the first state to undertake such an initiative.
The program was launched by the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association (MCOPA) to help citizens identify criminals posing as plainclothes officers and to make protected venues safe from people who try to gain access by posing as law enforcement.
Massachusetts law requires that police departments issue ID cards to their full-time police officers, but there has never been a standard for the design or content of the card. Each agency was left to design its own card and, as a result, recognizing them as authentic was problematic. In fact, most police officers admitted that they were unable to describe the ID cards carried by officers in adjoining jurisdictions.
Under a program launched in 2011, Massachusetts police officers carry uniform identification cards equipped with advanced security features. The first issuance was funded by the state’s homeland security regions; replacement cards are the responsibility of the department.
The first thing you notice about the new Massachusetts police ID is that it is portrait oriented, so that when it is slid it into a shield case it is oriented the same as the shield. A few other police departments like NYPD have made this same change. There is also a quarter inch margin around the edge of the card so that data is not obstructed when the card is placed in a case.
The new ID card has a banner across the top that reads “Commonwealth of Massachusetts”. Beneath the banner is the word “police” in large bold font. Further down is the officer’s photo. Officers are photographed by their departments against a blue background in uniform and without hats.
Beside the officer’s photo is the department seal, usually the shoulder patch, and beneath it are the officer’s name, rank, department, the department’s primary address and a twenty-four hour telephone number. The address is provided so that a lost card can be returned, and the telephone number allows an officer from another jurisdiction to call the department if necessary to verify the ID. All cards also bear issuance and expiration dates.
The back of the card is landscape. In the top left corner is a serial number (which can be entered into NCIC). If a card is lost or stolen the department can order a replacement, but it will come through with a different serial number. On the back of Massachusetts’ ID card is a writable surface. Officers sign the rear of their card upon receiving it. The TSA requires a signature on ID cards for officers who needs to carry a firearm on a commercial airliner.
The text beneath the officer’s signature attests that the bearer is a law enforcement officer as defined by the federal Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA). There are also instructions for a person who finds a lost card instructing him or her to mail it back to the issuing department or drop it in a mailbox. The bar code at the very bottom contains the officer’s name, rank and department and can be read with any standard bar code reader. This has been provided for future use and could be used to log officers in as they enter a command post or arrive at the scene of a critical incident.
Security first
The vendor chosen for the project is the current provider of drivers’ licenses in 43 different states, including Massachusetts. Their participation is beneficial because some of the security features used on the Massachusetts driver’s license are utilized on the Massachusetts police ID card. There are three levels of security on the police ID card: overt, covert and forensic.
Overt features are those that we will tell the public about, and citizens can use them to determine an authentic card.
Covert features are not obvious to the untrained eye, and are not revealed to members of the public.
Forensic features may only be detected by L-1 using specialized equipment. Typically, that would occur if someone tried to counterfeit a police ID and L-1 needed to establish in a court of law that the card was a fake. The forensic security features are a closely guarded secret and only a handful of people know what they are. This article will review only the overt features.
The first and most significant security device is the Kinegram, which is an Optical Variable Device, or OVD. If you compare the Kinegram on the new police ID to the one on a Massachusetts driver’s license, you will see that they are identical. Not only can police officers verify the authenticity of a police ID by examining the same Kinegram they see on the licenses of motorists they stop, but a citizen who has their own driver’s license can compare it to the Kinegram on a police ID. The Kinegram is a highly secure device that is nearly impossible to duplicate. This is more sophisticated than a simple hologram.
Secure delivery system
Each police department is issued a code for access to a secure web portal. An officer assigned as the “department administrator” uploads an electronic version of their department seal and the signature of the police chief or commissioner. Individual cards are ordered one at a time.
Massachusetts police ID cards are manufactured at a secure location. Cards are shipped directly to each chief of police, rather than to individual officers or administrators.
Retired officers
Cards are available for officers when they retire. To be eligible, a retired officer must have separated from his or her department “in good standing” as required by LEOSA. Cards carried by retired officers look essentially the same as those for active duty officers except that the word RETIRED appears in red directly beneath the photograph, and the text on the rear of the card attests that the bearer is a retired law enforcement officer as defined by federal law. Cards issued to retired officers do not expire, but they remain the property of the issuing department and must be surrendered upon demand.
Establishing and enforcing standards
A credential is only as valid as the controls that govern its issuance. For this reason, a set of standards was established to ensure the uniform issuance and regulation of the cards. Massachusetts legislature has also passed a bill authorizing the state’s Secretary of Public Safety and Security to issue regulations regarding police identification cards. In order to qualify for a police ID card, an officer must meet the definition of a law enforcement officer as defined in LEOSA. Cards may not be issued to personnel who are not paid for the providing of police service.
Finally, each department is required to issue to its personnel a department policy on police identification cards. A model policy has been provided to every law enforcement agency.
Informing the public
ID cards are only effective if people know what to look for, so the MCOPA undertook an information campaign when the new cards were rolled out. A website called MassPoliceID.com was created for use by both law enforcement and the general public. People visiting the site can view a low resolution image of the new card. Visitors can also play a game where they are asked to estimate whether a pictured ID card is authentic or phony. MCOPA has distributed the flyers to the security division within the state court system, the federal courthouses, the TSA, sports stadiums and military bases.
The law enforcement community is expected to identify and correct security vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation by criminals and terrorists. It only makes sense that a professional uniform and secure police credential be distributed statewide. The next step would be for states and law enforcement agencies to share that information, so that officers in surrounding states and across the country could easily check and verify law enforcement credentials from any state.

Story 203
PXG has introduced a new set of wedges unlike any others in the golf equipment industry: each one 100% milled from a chunk of soft carbon steel. Also unique is their price tag.
The game-changing collection of 0311T milled wedges -- which are only available through custom fittings -- range in price from $650 to $800 depending on the finish. They're pricier than most brand-name drivers on the market, but that's par for the course for the premium clubs from Parsons Xtreme Golf. Much like high-end luxury automobiles, PXG's clubs are designed for a specific, and demanding, consumer base.
"Performance is PXG's only measure for success and we believe our new milled wedges could very well be the best performing, most consistent wedge the golf industry has ever known," says PXG founder Bob Parsons.
PXG
The milled wedges are the brainchild of PXG senior designer Mike Nicolette, who played in 227 PGA Tour events and once beat Greg Norman in a playoff for his lone PGA Tour title.
Particular about his wedges, Nicolette said he always struggled to find one he liked after his were worn down. There were times Nicolette went through 30 to 40 wedges just to find one with performance characteristics similar to the one he was using previously. With the new wedges 100% milled from 8620 soft carbon steel, the consistent performance is being repeated from club to club.
"I have always wanted to design an entirely milled wedge, but it’s a time consuming and expensive process," said Nicolette, who spent 23 years designing clubs at Ping before joining Parsons at PXG. "With Bob Parsons’ support and commitment to exploring new processes and materials, we’ve been able to develop a collection of milled wedges that are nothing short of incredible."
Erik Matuszewski
It takes 4 1/2 hours to mill one wedge, with those being used by professional players such as Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore and Lydia Ko starting as a 11-pound block of steel. The production wedges are forged into the general shape and then every line, curve and angle is produced to exacting specifications via milling. The new soft carbon steel is almost twice as strong as its predecessor, meaning a longer life span for the clubs.
"If these wedges cost $150, we'd have the market cornered," Nicolette said.
The PXG 0311T wedges are available in a series of sole designs. Sugar Daddy, the model being used by Ko, is effectively the line's one-size-fits-all wedge, able to be used effectively from a wide variety of turf and sand conditions. It's available in eight different lofts, from 46 degrees to 60 degrees.
The Romeo is inspired by Moore, with a mild initial angle, minimal heel relief and extreme bounce, while the Zulu is inspired by Johnson, incorporating a steep initial angle and aggressive heel and toe relief. Both are available in 58- and 60-degree lofts.
Pricing for the chrome finish is $650, while wedges in Xtreme Dark finish are $750 each.
PXG
The $800 Darkness wedges were created for Parsons himself, with a sole design that incorporates a moderate initial angle and moderate heel relief coupled with a slightly larger head size for added forgiveness. It's part of a special collection of black clubs and gear that feature a skull insignia and the number 26 that represents the 26th Marine Corps Regiment that Parsons served with during the Vietnam War. The Darkness Wedge is available in lofts of 55 and 60 degrees.
PXG's milled wedges aren't available through retail channels, only through the company's authorized fitters who work with more than 1,200 clubs and facilities. These wedges, like all PXG clubs, aren't for everybody. But there's unquestionably a growing market for high-end equipment. That's evident in Titleist's partnership with James Patrick Harrington, who last week unveiled his new line of JP Wedges that cost $2,000 for a set of three along with a custom fitting experience.
The process to build PXG's newest wedges is even more time intensive. And Nicolette won't be the only one excited about the outcome.

Story 204
(CNN) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has threatened Wikipedia with legal action if the online encyclopedia doesn't remove the FBI's seal from its site.
The seal is featured in an encyclopedia entry about the FBI.
Wikipedia isn't backing down, however. The online encyclopedia -- which is run by a nonprofit group and is edited by the public -- sent a chiding letter to the FBI, explaining why, in its view, the FBI is off its legal rocker.
"In short, then, we are compelled as a matter of law and principle to deny your demand for removal of the FBI Seal from Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons," the Wikimedia Foundation's general counsel, Mike Godwin, wrote in a letter to the FBI, which was posted online by the New York Times.
"We are in contact with outside counsel in this matter, and we are prepared to argue our view in court."
The whimsically written letter from Wikipedia says the FBI's reading of relevant law is both "idiosyncratic" and "more importantly, incorrect." It also notes that the FBI's seal appears on other websites, including in an online entry from Encyclopedia Britannica.
In a letter dated July 22, and also posted online by the Times, the FBI told Wikipedia it must remove the bureau's seal because the FBI had not approved use of the image.
"The FBI has not authorized use of the FBI seal on Wikipedia," the letter says. "The inclusion of a high quality graphic of the FBI seal on Wikipedia is particularly problematic, because it facilitates both deliberate and unwitting" copying and reprinting of the seal's image.
The FBI's deputy general counsel, David Larson, cities a particular law that says duplicating an official "insignia" is illegal without permission.
But Wikipedia strikes back on that point, saying the FBI redacted the most important part of that U.S. code, which defines an insignia as "any badge, identification card, or other insignia."
"Badges and identification cards are physical manifestations that may be used by a possessor to invoke the authority of the federal government. An encyclopedia article is not," Wikipedia's letter says. "The use of the image on Wikipedia is not for the purpose of deception or falsely to represent anyone as an agent of the federal government."
The Wikipedia letter also adds:
"Even if it could be proved that someone, somewhere, found a way to use a Wikipedia article illustration to facilitate a fraudulent representation, that would not render the illustration itself unlawful under the statute."
It's unclear if this tussle -- which has already made its way into a Wikipedia entry on the FBI's seal -- will be taken to court. For now, the tech press is weighing in, often with amazement.
On the blog BoingBoing, Rob Beschizza writes that this is a no-win situation for the FBI.
"The part that's hard to understand is why the FBI would seek to abuse the law in such petulant fashion," he writes, "knowing that it will be subject to public ridicule for its actions."
The magazine Vanity Fair posted the FBI's seal on its website in a symbol of jest. And, as the blog Geekosystem says, an editor on the site aggregator Reddit jokes that maybe the FBI got Wikipedia confused with WikiLeaks -- the site that's been causing a stir lately over leaked war documents.
Cindy Cohn, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the New York Times, which first reported this story, that she found the whole ordeal to be "silly" and "troubling."

April 2018
It has been a year since we welcomed the Mazda 6 onto our long-term test fleet and, at the time, it was a recently facelifted model.
Now, as it goes back, Mazda has announced another facelift for the car, which will be available later in the year.
The biggest change is in specification. Where our SE-L Nav model was ranked third out of the four available trims, on the new car SE-L will be the base model.
It gains LED headlights and a host of assistance features such as lane keep assist, blind spot monitor and adaptive cruise control – things we would have liked to have had fitted on our car.
Prices have increased by around £1,000 (like-for-like) but the new model promises greater refinement and greater luxury.
We covered 12,000 pain-free miles in our car. It never let us down or needed any maintenance.
Our average fuel economy was on par with the Equa Index at 53mpg, although a period of regular town driving saw the figure plummet to the low 40s.
The 6 is most at home on the motorway where its 2.2-litre diesel engine has plenty of torque and makes for an effortless cruise.
On country lanes, the 6 is more adept than its rivals with impressive dynamics making for an enjoyable driving experience.
We were disappointed by its halogen headlamps, which were too dim for unlit country lanes, and found its heating system struggled to de-mist the windows on a cold morning.
The sat-nav system was more impressive, with speed camera alerts and live traffic updates.
One thing that really stood out was just how quiet its diesel engine was at idle and the flexibility of the engine on the move made it feel like a petrol, with a broad power range.
The Mazda 6 is under-rated and should be a serious contender for those considering rivals such as the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Insignia.
If the new model builds on the already excellent package, it should be a no-brainer choice for many.

Much like the national statistics reveal how much time people lose each year due to sitting in traffic jams, so I can measure time lost waiting for the Mazda 6’s heater to clear the front and rear windscreens.
It’s that slow.
I can’t say how long exactly because I’ve yet to find the patience to sit on my drive until the front windscreen fully demists, resulting instead to a few hasty swipes with a cloth to circumvent the process.
Certainly, the rear window is still not completely clear five minutes into my journey.
If time is precious, then perhaps this is not the car for you.
However, in many ways, that would be a shame because the Mazda 6 has much going for it.
Undeniable one of the most attractive looking cars in its segment, it offers an engaging, agile drive – fun to drive with sporty road manners – and a refined, yet powerful, 2.2-litre diesel engine with plenty of mid-range oomph.
From start-up, the engine is one of the quietest on the market and, while first impressions of the steering are that it is a little light and frothy, you quickly become accustomed to the feel of the car.
Well-equipped in SE-L Nav trim, mid-to-high 50s fuel consumption is possible on longer journeys, although high 40s is more likely when a mix of commuting is added. It’s a way off the official 68.9mpg but close to the Equa Index’s 53.1mpg.
Despite approaching eight years old, albeit with a couple of facelifts/updates since that transformed the interior with higher quality materials, fewer buttons and an improved infotainment system, the Mazda 6 remains one of the best in its class.

Model tested: Mazda 6 2.2D SE-L NAV
Winter was in full swing as I took the keys to our long-term Mazda 6 and, after brushing off a modest covering of snow, I was disheartened to learn that our SE-L spec car doesn’t come with all-important heated seats.
Mazda doesn’t offer optional extras across the 6 range so the only way to enjoy a warm bottom is to opt for a range-topping Sport Nav – costing £2,500 more.
While it may seem inconsiderate of Mazda to expect drivers to manage without such ‘crucial’ equipment, this is a sales model we should expect to become commonplace as manufacturers have to battle with revised emissions testing.
All new cars must be tested for each configuration of equipment, potentially leading to hundreds of tests required for a single model.
Seat has just announced a similar ‘trim-only’ choice for its new Arona model for this reason.
Once I’d warmed up using the 6’s climate control system I started to get a feel for what Mazda calls ‘Jinba Ittai’ or ‘car and driver in perfect harmony’.
At first, I thought the car’s steering was far too light, but after settling in for a few miles it became apparent that the Mazda is a really great car to drive.
It isn’t particularly fast or sporty and the limits of grip in the wet are relatively easy to uncover, but for outright ‘feel’ there is very little that can compete.
The car is very easy to predict and very precise, so you can always judge perfectly how it will respond – be it braking distance, acceleration or cornering ability.
Mazda says you should feel at one with the car, like a horse and rider, and you really do.
This isn’t about driving like a ‘hooligan’ either, the sense of attachment is there at all speeds making for a relaxing and enjoyable ride – even if it starts off a bit cold.

The Mazda 6 has been put through its paces as part of our long-term test fleet, but how does it compare to some rivals?
The Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Insignia and Volkswagen Passat are dominant players in this sector.
However, the Mazda 6 comfortably holds its own when viewed alongside similar derivatives of these popular fleet models.
Our test car is powered by Mazda’s 2.2-litre (150PS) diesel engine and delivers 107g/km. That’s the same CO2 as the Mondeo 2.0TDCi Eco 150 Zetec – the equivalent of 68.9mpg.
In fact the Mazda 6 and the Mondeo have the most frugal engines across the four, with the Passat 2.0TDI 150 S a marginally higher 109g/km (67.3mpg) and the Insignia Grand Sport 1.6 EcoTec Sri VX Line Nav offering 114g/km (65.7mpg).
From a benefit-in-kind (BIK) perspective, it means a Mazda 6 driver will pay 23% this tax year, rising to 25% in 2018/19 and 28% in 2019/20.
With a P11D price of £24,100, that would equate to £1,109 for a 20% taxpayer this financial year. Employers would have to pay £140 in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and £765 in Class 1A NICs.
However, a Mondeo driver would pay slightly less (£1,005), thanks to a lower P11D price of £21,850. An employer would pay the same VED costs and £694 in Class 1A NICs, according to the Fleet News company car tax calculator.
With a P11D price of £24,240, the Passat driver would pay the most, £1,115 this financial year. VED would be same, while Class 1A NICs of £769 would also be the highest across the four.
Meanwhile, the Insignia’s P11D price of £22,745 helps keep both employer and employee costs down despite falling into a higher BIK bracket. The driver would pay £1,092 this financial year. VED would be the same and Class 1A NICs would be £753.
Analysis of all-important running costs put the Mazda 6 at the bottom of the pile.
Not by much, but taking into consideration depreciation, service, maintenance and repair (SMR) and fuel, based on a four-year/80,000 mile cycle, its running costs would be 35.24 pence per mile (ppm).
The Passat comes out slightly better at 35.12ppm, but behind the Mondeo at 32.93ppm and the Insignia, which costs 32.08ppm.
October 2017
As a four-door saloon, the Mazda 6 is something of a rare breed.
Hatchbacks and estates have proved the popular choice in recent years so Mazda’s decision to favour a saloon seems surprising.
While the previous Mazda 6 had a 500-litre boot, this latest model has a narrower opening and can carry just 483 litres behind the rear seats, smaller than some of its competitors.
Pop the rear seats down however, and the Mazda can carry 1,632 litres of luggage – a figure that’s much more competitive with the best in class.
The fact is, despite its large size and length, Mazda has prioritised style and agility in the Mazda 6 over space for your luggage. I’m not about to complain about that.
September 2017
Mazda’s company car credentials are strengthened thanks to its Skyactiv technology which delivers low emissions without sacrificing power.
Introduced in 2011, it was driven by a desire to increase fuel efficiency, while retaining a degree of driving pleasure.
Engineers at the Japanese manufacturer designed a lightweight, but rigid, platform, improved transmissions and developed engines which squeeze far more energy from every drop of fuel.
Our test car is powered by Mazda’s 2.2 (150PS) diesel engine which delivers 107g of CO2/km.
To put that in context, the Kia Picanto, which is a city car, delivers 101g/km from a 1.0-litre petrol engine.
Mazda claims the Skyactiv-D provides a fuel economy improvement of 20% over conventional diesel engines.
The combined fuel economy on our test car has been hovering around the 46mpg mark against a claimed combined of 68.9mpg – a 30% shortfall.
From a benefit-in-kind (BIK) perspective, it means a company car driver will pay 23% this tax year, rising to 25% in 2018/19 and 28% in 2019/20.
With a P11D price of £24,100, that would equate to £1,109 for a 20% tax-payer this financial year.
Employers would have to pay £140 in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and £765 in Class 1A NICs.
Running costs, taking into consideration depreciation, service, maintenance and repair (SMR) and fuel, based on a four-year/80,000 mile cycle, would be 35p per mile (ppm).
It is also worth noting that if you reimburse your company car drivers according to Government advisory fuel rates (AFRs), that frugal engine could prove beneficial to them.
The 2.2-litre engine falls into the highest bracket, giving drivers 12ppm.
August 2017
The Mazda 6 proved a family saloon can be fun to drive when it was put through its paces on a 400-mile return trip to the Lake District.
On the motorway, it delivered a comfortable, relaxing ride, helped by new engine noise reduction technology and no shortage of passenger space.
The 2.2-litre Skyactiv-D engine, with emissions of 107g/km, was able to cruise effortlessly at 70mph, while returning a not too shabby 58mpg against a claimed 78.3mpg.
But, perhaps unusually for a family four-door saloon, it was equally at home on the national park’s winding roads.
The ride was firm and it cornered really well for such a large car, thanks in part to some new tech from the Japanese manufacturer.
Called G-Vectoring Control (GVC), the system gives you much more confidence when cornering as it momentarily reduces the amount of torque delivered to the front wheels, thereby transferring a fraction more weight onto the front axle which allows the front wheels to turn more precisely.
However, all that fun did come with an expected fall in fuel economy.
Negotiating the park’s more rural roads returned 39mpg against the official urban figure of 56.5mpg – a 30% shortfall.
Nevertheless, that was still impressive, when the combined fuel economy has been hovering around the 46mph mark against a claimed combined of 68.9mpg.
Mazda hopes this extra focus on sportiness will pay dividends and judging by this latest outing for our test car, the Japanese manufacturer could be right.

July 2017
The Mazda 6 saloon and tourer benefited from a host of updates last autumn, with two key improvements to the 2.2-litre Skyactiv-D engine.
Transient Control and Mazda’s Natural Sound Smoother technology (NSS) aim to increase responsiveness and reduce engine noise.
By cutting turbo lag and boosting torque, Transient Control aims to provide a more positive throttle response which it certainly delivers.
The 2.2-litre engine produces 150PS at 4,500rpm, but thanks to its Skyactiv technology emissions have been kept to an impressive 107g/km, giving a claimed combined of 68.9mpg. However, our test car is achieving 44.7mpg – a 35% shortfall.
Meanwhile, the introduction of Mazda’s NSS technology is designed to reduce diesel knock noise during starting and low-speed acceleration.
NSS suppresses resonance from the piston and connecting rod by using a dynamic damper inside the piston pin to suppress the three critical frequency bands in which engine components typically vibrate most loudly.
Having spent the past couple of days with the radio on mute, it definitely delivers a quieter cabin compared to some other diesels.
It is complemented by improvement in sound insulation, including the adoption of upgraded door seals, tighter tolerances between panels and sound deadening materials added to the underbody, rear console, headliner and doors, while laminated front side windows further suppress wind noise.
A further update is G-Vectoring Control (GVC) which gives you much more confidence when cornering.
By monitoring your steering and throttle position when you enter a corner under power, GVC momentarily reduces the amount of torque delivered to the front wheels, thereby transferring a fraction more weight onto the front axle which allows the front wheels to turn more precisely.
Inside, there is a new leather steering wheel that on Sport Nav models is heated.
Other premium upgrades to Sport Nav models include an enhanced head up display that features colour and Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) for the first time, plus electric memory seats that now also adjust the head-up display.

It may sound like something you would find in a fighter jet rather than a four-door saloon, but G-Vectoring Control (GVC) is now a mainstay of this fleet favourite.
By monitoring your steering and throttle position when you enter a corner, GVC momentarily reduces the amount of torque delivered to the front wheels, thereby transferring a fraction more weight onto the front axle which allows the wheels to turn more precisely.
The result is a car which handles really well, giving you bags of driving confidence. Coupled with a 2.2-litre diesel engine and with 150PS or 175PS versions available, this is a fun car to drive.
Both diesels use a two-stage turbocharger, with two turbines and a large intercooler, producing excellent torque – even at low revs.

The Mazda6 has now covered 2,000 miles and my average fuel consumption has nudged up to 48.4mpg.
While this is an improvement it is still some way off Mazda’s claim of 68.9mpg, although it is close to the Equa Index’s real-world figure of 53.1mpg.
The Mazda6 is generously equipped. The entry-level SE comes with air-con, 17-inch alloy wheels, leather gear lever and steering wheel, cruise control and a seven-inch colour touchscreen infotainment system with digital radio, Bluetooth and a USB connection.
The car has a sleek and powerful look on the outside and a premium feel inside. It is pleasurable and responsive to drive.
The boot is generous at 480 litres, however the opening is fairly narrow so bulkier items simply won’t fit in.

April 2017
The newest addition to our fleet brings with it a degree of deja-vu given that in 2013 we ran the then-new Mazda 6 on long-term test.
Having undergone two facelifts – we thought we’d give it another try to see if it can still shape up compared to competition from the Vauxhall Insignia and Škoda Superb.
Visually very little has changed – our new car even comes in the same shade of metallic Soul Red (£680 option), but that is no bad thing as the Mazda 6 is a fine-looking saloon.
The real difference in this model is under the skin. Mazda continues to prioritise driver engagement in its cars, so the focus has been on improving refinement and handling.
Mazda has developed new technology called G-Vectoring Control which moderates engine torque while cornering. It allows the car to optimise its weight balance as the driver steers and ensures the 6 delivers nimble handling.
Two engines are available: a 2.0-litre Skyactiv-G petrol with 145PS or 165PS and a 2.2-litre 150PS or 175PS Skyactiv-D diesel.
Our model is the 2.2-litre 150PS diesel in SE-L-Nav trim costing £24,295. This is the most popular model chosen by fleets and it emits 107g/km of CO2 with average fuel consumption of 68.9mpg.
By avoiding the trend to downsize, Mazda’s diesel is now one of the largest in the sector. Rivals like the Insignia, Mondeo and Superb are all available with much lower-capacity engines. However, in like-for-like comparisons the difference in benefit-in-kind (BIK) tax is marginal. A similarly specced 1.5-litre Mondeo would only save the driver £100 a year.
The advantage of the larger engine is strong performance: 0-62mph takes 9.1 seconds while 380Nm of torque ensures there is adequate pull in all six gears.
Ride quality is excellent and its low driving position gives an engaging drive. Both front and rear passengers have plenty of leg room, while the boot is generous at 480 litres.

Story 206
Default privacy settings often aren’t very private. A tech columnist is back with Round 2 of his clickable guide to improving your privacy on all sorts of devices and online services.
It’s not just Google and Facebook that are spying on you.
Your TV, your cellphone provider and even your LinkedIn account have side hustles in your data. But in many cases, you can opt out – if you know where to look.
I dug into a bunch of popular products and services you might not think of as data vacuums or security risks and found their default privacy settings often aren’t very private. So I collected here some common settings you can change to stop giving away so much. Here are clickable instructions for televisions, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo, cellphone carriers and WiFi routers.
Two weeks ago, I offered similar suggestions on the worst default settings for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple. Thousands of you told me about your experiences trying to protect your privacy and asked about how to go further.
What I learned is that despite the rhetoric from tech companies, few actually make it easy to be in control of your data. They hide behind menus as confusing as the floor plan at Ikea. I’m a professional gadget guy, and I found even I’ve gotten tricked into handing over too much by my TV maker and phone service.
Many of these companies collect our data so they can sell ads targeted to our specific behaviors and interests. They claim people prefer these kinds of personalized ads – but much more often I hear people complain targeted ads are creepy. You can love technology like I do and still be angry that Silicon Valley is making surveillance the price of using the internet.
At the very least, companies should be much more upfront about what they’re doing with our data. I couldn’t get straight answers out of many. Others made avoiding tracking or targeted ads so cumbersome, I couldn’t include them in this list I hope you can complete in half an hour.
The steps I outline below are small acts of resistance. But I’m hopeful we can send a message that we’re going to judge products on privacy – and the wise companies will learn to use it as a competitive advantage.
TVs
Your TV is watching you. Often, default settings (or screens you likely clicked “agree” to during setup) allow smart TVs, streaming boxes and cable services to track significant amounts of personal information. They know what you’re watching and what apps you use. In 2017, TV maker Vizio even had to pay millions to settle complaints from the Federal Trade Commission and the state of New Jersey for collecting this kind of data with users’ knowledge.
— Recent smart TVs from Samsung, the best-selling brand, track how you use your TV to target ads that Samsung inserts on menu screens.
During setup, the TV encourages you to agree to a bunch of terms of and conditions that include permission for “Interest-based advertisements.” You can say no them, but if you didn’t realize what was going on – or now you’re just not sure – you’ll have to dig into your TV’s settings to stop the tracking.
With your remote, go to Settings, then Support, then Terms & Policy, then Interest Based Advertisements and choose to Disable interactive services. (On older Samsung TVs, you might find this under the Smart Hub menu.)
You’ll find similar settings on smart TVs made by LG, Sony and Vizio.
What you give up: More-relevant ads.
— Roku streaming boxes as well as Roku-branded TVs made by TCL, Hisesne, Insignia and others by default track the channels and apps you watch.
To tell Roku to stop, use your remote to find Settings, then Privacy, then Advertising and tap Limit ad tracking.
What you give up: More-targeted ads in Roku menus. Roku won’t actually stop collecting data, though.
— Cable services also often track the programs you’re watching so they can target ads.
For Comcast, the largest cable company, turn off the targeting on the Web by logging into Xfinity.com or use this link, then going to My Account, then finding Alerts and Ad Preferences, then scrolling until you find Cable Targeted Advertising, tapping Edit near it, and then clicking Opt out and then Save.
Other cable companies have a similar functions with slightly different names. Spectrum from Charter calls it Additional Marketing and Targeted Television Ads or try this link. Verizon Fios calls it Relevant TV advertising.
What you give up: You’ll still get ads, but they’ll be less targeted.
LinkedIn
Here’s my job evaluation for LinkedIn: Office busybody. Based on the assumption that you want to broadcast your professional life, the social network’s defaults expose a lot.
LinkedIn has some 60 data, privacy and advertising settings you can control. To get to them on your phone’s LinkedIn app, tap your picture in the upper left corner, then the gear icon in the upper right corner. On the Web to this link or go from your home screen to Me, then Settings.
Your profile is visible to the public and searchable on Google. Data shared by default could include your first and last name, your number of connections, your posts on LinkedIn and details of your current and past work experience.
Scaling back this information is most easily done on the Web. Go to LinkedIn, find Settings and then Privacy, then click on Change next to Edit your public profile. There you can turn off your public profile entirely and choose which details you’re comfortable sharing.
What you give up: There will be less info about you out there for ex-colleagues and would-be employers to find – as well as aggressive salespeople, crooks and stalkers.
— Every time you look at someone’s LinkedIn profile, LinkedIn tells them you were there.
Make your visits anonymous by going to this link or in the app from Settings to Privacy, then tapping Profile viewing options. There, switch to Private mode.
What you give up: Once you go private, you won’t be able to know who looked at your profile, either – unless you pay for a premium LinkedIn subscription.
— Every time you make an edit on your profile, LinkedIn broadcasts the change to your connections.
Turn off the oversharing by going to this link or to Settings, then Privacy, then click to change Sharing profile edits, and toggle it to No.
What you give up: Connections might miss an important update like a promotion – but you could always just turn this back on temporarily for a change you do want to broadcast.
— LinkedIn pings your professional connections when it’s your birthday, too. Why on earth?
Turning this off requires changing the visibility of your birth date in your contact info. This one involves a lot of clicks: On the Web go to the Me icon on your LinkedIn homepage, then View profile, then See contact info. In the window that pops up, click Edit, and there under Birthday, set it as visible to Only you.
What you give up: Birthday notes from people you met at conferences.
You can take steps to keep creepy advertisers out of your professional life, too.
— LinkedIn by default targets ads at you based on the personal data you enter and also by tracking other websites you go to. It even uses your data to target ads you see outside of LinkedIn.
Scale back access by using this link or by going from Settings to Ads in the app. There, I recommend switching most of the choices to No, including Insights on websites you visited, Ads beyond LinkedIn, as well as the many specific categories of data collected on LinkedIn (Connections, Location, Demographics, Companies You Follow, etc.) and towards the bottom, Interactions with businesses.
What you give up: More targeted ads, potentially including interesting job ads.
— LinkedIn can use your name and photo in ads you see. Who thought that was a good idea?
Use this link or under the Ads settings, switch off Profile data for ad personalization.
What you give up: You’ll no longer be asked to “picture yourself” in a help-wanted ad.
Twitter
Unlike other social networks, most people assume what they do on Twitter is public. So maybe you’re not surprised to know that it’s in the business of selling your attention to advertisers, just like Facebook and LinkedIn.
– – By default, Twitter will try to target ads to you based not only on what you do on Twitter, but also your activity outside the social network, including information it buys from data brokers.
Turn that off on the web at this link, or in the mobile app by tapping on your profile picture, then Settings and privacy, then Privacy and safety, then scroll down to find and tap Personalization and data, then toggle off everything.
What you give up: The ads you see on Twitter will be less targeted, and some other aspects of your Twitter experience, such as recommendations for follows and news events, may also be less personalized to you.
Props to Twitter: Its defaults for permission to track your precise location and collect your address book contacts are both set to off.
Yahoo
Yahoo, now part of a company called Oath and owned by Verizon, is still used by millions of people for email, to follow news and explore the Web. And like its rival Google, Yahoo is making money by tracking you and selling your attention to advertisers. The good news is Yahoo keeps most of its settings in one Privacy Dashboard: yahoo.mydashboard.oath.com
Three defaults worth changing in Yahoo’s privacy settings.
— Yahoo tracks what you do across its sites and services – including the content of your email and messenger communications – to, you guessed it, target ads at you.
Turn it off from the Dashboard. Tap Personalized Advertising on our Products, and toggle it to off, or Disagree.
What you give up: You’ll see more generic ads, but not fewer ads.
— Yahoo is tracking your precise location from its apps and websites.
Turn it off from the Dashboard. Tap Precise Location, and toggle it off, or Disagree.
What you give up: Yahoo will still use your location in services (like the weather report) that require it, but not for serving you targeted ads
— Yahoo is following you across the Web to provide “personalized experiences” on other sites and – surprise, surprise – deliver more targeted ads.
To turn it off from the Dashboard. Tap on Oath Across the Web, and toggle it off, or Disagree.
What you give up: Personalized experiences on Yahoo partner sites.
Phone plans from AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint
Nobody knows more about where you go and what you do than your cellphone provider. And even though you’re already paying them for service, some want to make money off your data, too. Shouldn’t they be the ones paying us for our data?
— AT&T by default enrolls customers into what it calls a Relevant Advertising program that uses a broad report of your location (such as your Zip code) and other data to let advertisers target you in websites and apps you see on your phone. AT&T also tries to convince you to click yes – it had even gotten me – to opt in to a program called Enhanced Relevant Advertising that tailors ads using more detailed information, including your Web browsing, app usage, and precise location.
Turn off both settings on the Web at this link, or log into your AT&T account and tap your name at the top to bring up a menu, then click View profile, then Communication preferences, then click on Privacy settings. There, make sure both Relevant Advertising and Enhanced Relevant Advertising, are opted out for all your phone numbers.
What you give up: More targeted ads.
— Verizon’s data programs include a partnership with Oath that makes it easier for them to track you for advertising. It also has a business selling aggregated data from customers that includes the websites we visit, apps we use and the places we go.
A Verizon spokesman didn’t answer my questions about the company’s defaults. You can make sure you’re opted out of both programs by using this link, or logging in to your Verizon Wireless account, then going to My Profile, then privacy settings. There find Relevant Mobile Advertising and Business & Marketing Insights, and set both to Don’t use my information.
What you give up: More targeted ads.
— T-Mobile’s data programs potentially allow advertisers and T-Mobile’s partners to target you based on your location, Web browsing and app activity.
A T-Mobile spokeswoman said she wasn’t sure what the company’s default settings were. You can check that you’ve got them all turned off by logging in to your T-Mobile account, then tapping Profile, then Privacy and Notifications. There, turn off Interest-Based Ads, Web Browsing & App Information and Device Location.
What you give up: More targeted ads.
— Sprint wants to use data about the websites you visit, apps you use and broad location data for its so-called Mobile Advertising Program – but participation is turned off by default.
Check your settings on the web by using this link, or by logging into your Sprint account, going to All about my account, and then tapping Manage mobile advertising and reporting preferences and making sure Do not use my info is selected.
While you’re there, you might also turn off Business and marketing report preferences – on by default – which allows Sprint to sell your anonymized data including precise location information to marketers and researchers. (Sprint says it is one of the few companies that even gives you the option to opt-out of such a program.)
What you give up: More targeted ads.
WiFi routers
Here’s a concern that’s as much about security as it is privacy: The default administrator password for your home WiFi router likely is . . . “password.” That’s a problem because anybody within range could log in and change your settings – or, worse, hack into your devices.
Many home routers come with generic passwords that they intend for you to change, even if most people don’t. This isn’t the password you use to get on the WiFi – it’s the control panel that runs your router. The most common is username: admin, password: password.
One common way to access your router’s control panel is to join your home network, then type into a Web browser bar http://192.168.1.1/ If that doesn’t work, try http://10.0.0.1/ or http://routerlogin.net If none of those work, try Googling your router’s brand name and router login. Then log in – try starting with username: admin, password: password. If that doesn’t work, you might have changed your password at some point, so congratulations! Or it is possible your router has an unusual default password, so Google for your brand’s default admin password. Once you’re in, find your way to settings and change your password to something more unique.
While you’re there, update your router’s software (called firmware), too, to keep you safer from hackers.
What you give up: Now there’s one more password you need to keep track of – which is why you should get a password manager, a topic for a whole other tech column.

How to Buy the Best Dash Cam Whether for safety, liability protection, or just capturing the occasional on-the-road spectacle, a dashboard camera can be your second set of eyes on the road. Here's what to look for when buying one, along with the top models out there. PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. Terms of use
Choosing the Right Dashboard Companion
Dash cams have gained in popularity recently in part because of jaw-dropping viral videos of stunt driving and stunning weather activity, like a gorgeous sunset or menacing tornado. Perhaps a less fun, but more important reason that drivers are putting dash cams into cars is to limit liability in accidents and capture vandalism when parked. Especially if you drive a company car or work for Lyft, Uber, or any other taxi service, having video proof of your role in an accident is crucial. For everyone else, it's just another piece of evidence to furnish to your insurance company in case of an accident or vehicle damage.
There's a varied landscape of dash cams out there, with a range of features including GPS navigation, safety alerts, and mobile app integration. Some even double as action cameras and are compatible with tripod mounts, so you can take them out of your car and into the great outdoors. Here's how to choose the right dash cam for you.
What Is a Dash Camera?
Most of the dash cams featured in this story record in at least 1080p video resolution, though you can dial that down in some cases to increase the amount of video you can store. Consider purchasing the largest memory card a dash cam will accept so that you can store the maximum amount of video, and remember to transfer it to your computer regularly if you want to keep it.
Many dash cams are set up to automatically record once you start the car, and to overwrite video once the internal storage or memory card is full. In the case of a collision, a dash cam with a G-Sensor will detect that action and automatically save the recording so you can view it later and use it as evidence if necessary. Some also have a still camera built in if you want to take a snapshot on your route, though it's usually low resolution, not even at the level of a smartphone image. A camera's field of view is important, as a wider-angle lens will capture more detail.
While some dash cams double as actual GPS navigation devices, others simply use GPS so that you can pinpoint where a video took place, which is important in the case of accidents or other incidents. It's also helpful when you capture a sunset, storm, or other interesting activity and want to know exactly where it happened.
Most dash cams have built-in screens so you can review video right on the device (hopefully not while driving), while others have no screen at all, and must be paired with a smartphone app. While a dash cam can act as a safety device, one with a large 5-inch screen will take up more space on your windshield and if not positioned carefully can be a distraction. Be sure to install it outside of your line of sight, perhaps closer to the passenger side. Smaller cams without screens can be installed right under the rearview mirror, and thus out of your sight.
The dash cams we tested use either a suction cup to connect to the windshield or an adhesive to stick to the rearview mirror or dashboard. Consider going for a test drive to be sure you've chosen a good spot and that it's securely installed.
Back It Up
Dash cam manufacturers have also entered into the rear-facing backup cam business. Many newer dash cam models have dual cameras that can be used side-by-side to get a wider field of view, or as simultaneous forward- and backward-facing cameras.
A rear-facing camera isn't necessary for everyone, though it's certainly convenient when backing out of a driveway or parking spot. However, many new cars have this feature built in, as well as GPS navigation and other safety features. There are also standalone options you can get in addition to a dash cam.
Driver Assists, Wireless Connectivity, and Apps
Dash cam companies have started adding driver-assist features that you'll find on newer, high-tech cars, such as lane departure warnings and forward collision alerts. Typically, these features kick in when you reach a certain speed. They could come in handy after a long day on the road or if you're using a company vehicle; they're not must-haves, though. Safety camera alerts, including red light and speed cameras, are helpful in avoiding traffic tickets. Some devices can even alert you of school zones and upcoming curves.
Certain dash cams double as radar detectors, with alerts to safety cameras and radar traps. Depending on the camera, you might need to pay an additional fee for services like these; we include the details in our individual reviews.
Some dash cams have Bluetooth in order to connect and sync with mobile apps, while others (though not many) use Wi-Fi. Pairing via Bluetooth also means, in some cases, that you can make and receive calls and text messages via voice.
Here are some of the most popular dash cams available.

THE STORY BEHIND THE TRANSFORMERS WFC MILITARY INSIGNIAS: REVEALED

There's more to the War for Cybertron: Siege line than the amazing figures. There's also the three-dimensional characters these figures represent, each with their own backstories and roles to play. One way we tell these stories is through a character's military ranking, represented by a military insignia unique to the character. Have you figured out the ranking system yet?

Yeah. We see you. We keep up on the comments sections of this and other fan sites. We know a lot of you didn't necessarily need this key, but as we were developing this system, we sure did. It was an important tool for organizing the system and giving all of us working on the project the guidelines needed to build an insignia for any character. It was actually all a bit of a process, and we thought it would be fun to tell you a bit about that process.


Where Did We Start ?


It started with a thought: In times of war, armies establish a clear chain of command, and the Autobots and Decepticons would be no different. Despite the chaos of brutal battles, some sort of organization would be established. They would need a way to indicate who's in charge. Sure, as such a key figure, everyone would know Optimus Prime is the General of the Autobot army, but where does Ironhide rank? Does he outrank Prowl? Would Starscream be Megatron's second-in-command during the war? Or would that come later? And what kind of role would they all play within their armies?

STARSCREAM: Still working his way up the ranks until he ultimately ascends to leader of the Decepticons…or tries to, anyway.

And then a bunch of us got in a room and geeked-out together about how this all would work. What could we create to deepen the story for fans? And how could we convey key pieces of a character's story through a single graphic? The answer was a military insignia that represented 3 things: Division, Unit, and Rank. But when determining these classifications for each character there were a few things we had to consider.


Assigning rankings to soldiers in the war for Cybertron: 3 key things we had to consider


First, these aren’t the Autobots and Decepticons we know. Their insignias needed to represent these characters during the War for Cybertron, long before becoming the larger-than-life heroes and villains we know them to be today. We had to think about where these characters are at the beginning of this chapter. War changes people robots. The Division, Unit, and Rank for some of these characters would be drastically different and not necessarily reflect who they will eventually become. There are characters that haven’t quite yet established themselves or haven’t yet moved into a field they will enter later. And so, all of that needed to be seeded in their insignias.



Believe it or not his overly cautious nature and dedication to safety makes him an effective medic in the War for Cybertron, though he does tend to over-diagnose patients. Just to be safe.

Second, what are the divisions and units that would naturally form during a raging civil war on an alien planet populated by giant converting robots? We had to take into account the nature of this particular war and the means with which our characters are fighting it. And at the same time we needed to think about who these characters are, their various alt modes, what their strengths and expertise are at this moment in time.

Third, how might the Autobots and Decepticons name these classifications differently? Would the Decepticons classifications sound a bit more sinister? Would they call a unit Black Ops where the Autobots would call it Special Ops? And, what would be the same regardless of faction?

When considering Engineering as an army unit, it worked well for the Autobots, but it didn't quite fit for the Decepticons. We pictured Shockwave in his lab, his one eye glowing with menacing genius, creating brutal, highly potent, and twisted weapons for the Decepticon army. Then thought, nope, that's not Engineering, that's Applied Sciences, a much more ambiguously ominous name you’d find within a military industrial complex like the one operated by the Decepticons.





Engineering VS. Applied Sciences


Designing Cybertronian Military Insignias: Considerations and Challenges


Naming conventions alone were not enough to show how the Autobots and Decepticons would approach military rankings differently, we needed to do so graphically, as well. Not only did we want the Decepticon graphics to look a little more threatening, we also wanted them to look more militarized. Most of the Decepticons originate from the military and defense forces of Cybertron, while the Autobots originate from the labor forces and civilian population. We knew we wanted the iconography to be reflective of that history.

You can see how the negative space within the Decepticon graphics is tighter and the angles are sharper, creating more intricate designs and a sense that you don't want to mess with these guys. The Autobot graphics are blockier with softer edges and angles. This, along with a more open use of the negative space evokes a greater sense of approachability and a certain gritty scrappiness when compared to the Decepticon graphics.



Fun fact: We didn’t initially design the insignias to be specifically Autobot or Decepticon. We started with a bunch of sketches of what Cybertronian military insignias could look like. Then we chose our top 2. From there we decided which felt more Autobot and which felt more Decepticon. Once we determined that, we were able to evolve the designs to emphasize the differences between the two factions.

Early sketches. Here are concept options 7 and 9 that would then become the basis for the Autobot and Decepticon insignias

One of the biggest challenges when designing these was how to symbolically convey through iconography to our human fans what the pieces of these Cybertronian military insignias represent without them looking at all human. Our first tries looked very human. It took some time, but eventually we were able to identify symbols that suggest meaning humans can understand, but look and feel like they were developed on the planet Cybertron by warring alien robot armies. We tried to focus on universal (in the most literal sense of the word) symbols, so things like weaponry and spaceship icons were fair game.




Here are some earlier insignia concepts before they were finalized. Not our human-looking outtakes, but you can see how certain elements changed and evolved before we landed on final designs.

Another challenge was how do we make this system infinite? We needed to establish these pieces of the puzzle in a way that could be built on and expanded as the world expands. A modular system where every piece needed to be interchangeable and our representations of those pieces needed to be easily built upon and adapted.

Look at Rank, for example. The lowest rank is represented by the simplest design, then becomes more complex for higher ranks. Initially, we didn’t have the Specialist rank, it was added after we had already established the system. Because of the modular nature of the system, it was easier to adapt and repurpose graphic elements used in other ranks in a way that would represent the new Specialist rank according to the rules we established.


What it all came down to


Ultimately, every decision we made came down to what felt right. If it felt true to the story, true to the character, true to the tone, true to everything we know about Transformers -- then that's what it had to be. And we loved every minute of it. It was so fun to go in and really geek-out. We hope you enjoyed it, too.

Views: 11,438 Hasbro will begin phasing out plastic from their packaging beginning in 2020. That includes polybags, elastic bands, shrink wrap, window sheets and blister packs, all to be phased out from new product releases by 2022. At the top of the press release it mentions products such as Nerf, My Little Pony, Monopoly, Magic: The Gathering, and Power Rangers, but does not state Transformers. This appears to be just a cursory listing of their products and does not specifically exclude Transformers.

Here's the press release from Hasbro - it's important to note at the end that we know with 100% certainty that this TerraCycle project does involve Transformers toys so these changes will be seen in our fandom at some point. TerraCyle recycles all forms of toys for reuse in various ways as described in the press release excerpt listed below.
From the press release:
"Reimagining and redesigning packaging across our brand portfolio is a complex undertaking, but we believe it’s important and our teams are up for the challenge,” said John Frascotti, President and Chief Operating Officer, Hasbro. “We know consumers share our commitment to protecting the environment, and we want families to feel good knowing that our packaging will be virtually plastic-free, and our products can be easily recycled through our Toy Recycling Program with TerraCycle*.”
Hasbro’s Toy Recycling Program enables consumers to send well-loved Hasbro toys and games to TerraCycle, a global leader in product recycling, who will recycle them into materials to be used in the construction of play spaces, flowerpots, park benches, and other innovative uses. Hasbro recently announced the expansion of the program to France, Germany and Brazil, and plans to expand the program to additional markets with the goal of ensuring all Hasbro toys and games are recyclable in the major markets where it does business."

Views: 26,152 There's some rumblings on line and it's not from this Destitution Class behemoth trouncing around Cybertron's surface. Thanks to fellow Seibertronians D-Maximal Prime with help from Sabrblade we've learned the word is that Transformers (possibly Siege, possibly not despite those blast effect pegs on his big mug) Unicron is going to be available in Japan through the TakaraTomy Mall!

The original post was found at


Here's from

"Wonder Festival 2019 summer Takara Tomy Transformers booth information.
The Wonder Festival 2019 Summer Takara Tomy Transformers Booth, which will be held at Makuhari Messe on Sunday, July 28, 2019, will be full of content!
7/24 (Wed) Blue-ray & DVD will be released from the movie "Bumblebee" corner, The "Masterpiece Rio Convoy", which was announced at the toy show the other day, and became a topic, "Legacy TV-kun," We are planning to exhibit the contents of the group's crowdfunding program!
In addition, we will exhibit Hasbro's global crowdfunding program "HASLAB Uniclon" just announced!
In addition, we will exhibit the latest products of SS, SIEGE and Generation Select."

Global crowd funding you say? This would seem to indicate outside of North America. From further into the announcement which is also the translated text from the image above:

"Hasbro's global crowdfunding plan just announced It will be decided to sell "HASLAB UNICLON" in Japan at Takara Tomy Mall!
We plan to start bookings by the 1st festival day.
On this occasion, it was decided to decorate the prototype at the one-fest venue.
Please check the huge transformers of unmatched size in the past by yourself.
Thank you for your support of crowdfunding!"

And in an update just this morning from
"7/17 addition : According to the one fess announcement of TAKARATOMY TF official site, there seems to be handling at TAKARATOMY mall in Japan. I think that this sales method is also probably crowdfunding, but there is a statement with reservation start soon."

Now whether this is an opening for crowdfunding, or just a statement that if approved it will also be available in Japan (possibly elsewhere in the world too) is yet to be seen.
*Correction - To clarify this story Takara IS taking orders for this item just like Hasbro is.*
We provide the posts from these various translated sources and ask you to decide. Let us know in the forums and as always stay tuned to Seibertron for all the latest Transformers news!

Views: 17,777 You are never getting that G1 Jetfire reissue, ever. For those unaware, while almost everything to do with Transformers is owned by Hasbro/Takara Tomy, the designs for the Jetfire toy is not, nor is the use of that specific Macross design appearing in media. Outside of Japan, that design is owned by Harmony Gold, a media holding company that is dealing more with real estate at the moment.

They have sued Hasbro on occasion before all in relation to Hasbro (or Hasbro license holders) releasing Jetfire products. Their contract was going to be finished in 2021 so nobody knew what would happen after that. Well, now we do, thanks to an article by

HOLLYWOOD, CA, July 5 – Harmony Gold USA, Inc. announced today that it has reached an agreement with the Japanese anime studio, Tatsunoko Productions, Co., to extend the worldwide, co-copyright ownership and exclusive management, excluding Japan, for its landmark anime series Robotech (including Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada). This agreement was achieved after a lengthy negotiation and allows Harmony Gold to continue to exploit the animated Robotech franchise well into the future.

Tommy Yune, President of Animation at Harmony Gold, had the following to say:

“It’s an extension of all the current agreements [that were made public in 2017]. It’s a renewal but actually it’s an extension for lack of a better term. We renewed but we decided as part of our renewal to extend the agreement.”

“Harmony Gold and Tatsunko [have been] partners in this whole thing. For future product that we’re working on, the IP is going to be jointly shared by both companies.”

Frank Agrama, Chairman of Harmony Gold added, "Over the past 35 years we have been blessed to work with our friends at Tatsunoko on developing one the world’s greatest entertainment franchises. With our extension we look forward to the next 35 years of working with Tatsunoko and world class business partners on Robotech.”

Since Harmony Gold has solidified their claim to the Robotech/Macross IP, that at least means that there is no ambiguity in the long term ownership of the brand helping their partnership with Sony for a Robotech film.


You are never getting that G1 Jetfire reissue, ever. For those unaware, while almost everything to do with Transformers is owned by Hasbro/Takara Tomy, the designs for the Jetfire toy is not, nor is the use of that specific Macross design appearing in media. Outside of Japan, that design is owned by Harmony Gold, a media holding company that is dealing more with real estate at the moment.They have sued Hasbro on occasion before all in relation to Hasbro (or Hasbro license holders) releasing Jetfire products. Their contract was going to be finished in 2021 so nobody knew what would happen after that. Well, now we do, thanks to an article by Den of Geek who posted the following announcement:HOLLYWOOD, CA, July 5 – Harmony Gold USA, Inc. announced today that it has reached an agreement with the Japanese anime studio, Tatsunoko Productions, Co., to extend the worldwide, co-copyright ownership and exclusive management, excluding Japan, for its landmark anime series Robotech (including Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada). This agreement was achieved after a lengthy negotiation and allows Harmony Gold to continue to exploit the animated Robotech franchise well into the future.Tommy Yune, President of Animation at Harmony Gold, had the following to say:“It’s an extension of all the current agreements [that were made public in 2017].
