            "content": "The National Fishworkers Forum (NFF) has sought a monthly allowance of ₹10,000 each for fishing households for up to three months, given the COVID-19-related losses in the fishing sector and the impending monsoon season trawling ban.\n\nIn a letter to Union Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Pratap Chandra Sarangi, NFF chairperson Narendra R. Patil and general secretary T. Peter said the condition that Aadhaar-linked bank accounts were a pre-requisite for providing financial assistance to fish workers should be scrapped.\n\nIn a March 30 letter, the Union Department of Fisheries had requested States and Union Territories to ''ascertain and confirm'' that all affected fishermen, fish farmers, fish workers and vendors had accounts with Aadhaar linkage.\n\n“Since most of the fish workers and some of the fish vendors have been issued licences/ fisher ID cards, these can be verified with the respective State/UT authorities in coordination with the trade unions of fish workers as well as other associations,” the NFF leaders said."

India is currently under a 21-day lockdown with nearly 50,000 people having already lost their lives globally.\n\nWhile IPL has been postponed till 15 April, there is very little chance of a shortened tournament in May as it might take months for normalcy to return.\n\n\"Here's a thought .. The IPL is played for the five weeks leading up to the T20 World Cup in Oz .. all players use it as the great warm up for the WC .. then the WC happens .. So important for the game that the IPL takes place but also the WC,\" Vaughan tweeted.\n\nHowever if one goes by Vaughan's suggestion, it would mean that he is expecting IPL in the September window in the lead upto the World T20 which begins in Australia on 18 October.\n\nIn September, India are supposed to play Asia Cup in the UAE which is going to be hosted by the Pakistan Cricket Board. After the Asia Cup, England are supposed to come to India to play three ODIs and three T20Is.\n\n\"September is the time when there is monsoon in India. Mumbai will be under water, there could be steady rain in Chennai. It is a decision that can't be taken that lightly,\" a senior BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity.\n\nThere is a suggestion to do away with the ICC World T20 in October-November and hand that slot to the BCCI for conducting of IPL but sources in ICC as well as BCCI feels that it's too premature to comment at the moment.\n\n\"You don't know the situation tomorrow. Let there be a sign that the curve is flattening and normalcy can return. That's when you start discussing options,\" the BCCI source said.\n\nFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets. Get technology news, gadgets reviews & ratings.

            "content": "By now, most social media groups would have got an advisory from an entity called the Cyber Crime Portal of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The advisory states how social media groups and their members should function during the Covid-19 outbreak. It lists five unverified messages related to the pandemic that must not be circulated. It also lists the legal provisions under which action can be taken against such violations, and provides a link to a form to report unverified postings and forwards.\n\nThis ‘advisory’ is a representative of what’s going on: it is not issued by the MHA or any of its divisions and is one of the many ‘fake news’ that has been flooding social media platforms with the outbreak of Covid-19. The only official note that went out — an advisory to social media intermediaries on curbing false news and misinformation about coronavirus — was issued by the Ministry of Electronics and IT on March 20.\n\nSpreading confusion\n\nEver since the coronavirus outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China, social media platforms have been flooded with posts on the disease. Beginning February, when awareness about the disease rose in India, social media platforms have seen numerous posts on Covid-19 — ranging from information on the outbreak to false news about its origin and spread to offering untested treatment for the disease, and also prescribing strange diets.\n\nNow, with a 21-day lockdown being enforced across the country, such misleading posts not only amplify the menace of fake news, creating panic and frustration, but also result in privacy violations as medical records of tested individuals are being willfully circulated online. In a few cases, false medical reports have also been generated for random individuals and then people are suspecting them of having the diseases and socially boycotting them.\n\nSuch overflow of content makes it difficult for the people to sift real news from the fakes. It also obscures the well-timed approach by the Modi government, where it uses technology and social media along with broadcast media to update the people on the prevalence and spread of the disease, especially on the precautions to be taken along with the right health and hygiene habits.\n\nDespite the warnings and concerns, many vicious minds continue to create and spread fake posts. A larger section forwards them across groups, often out of ignorance or the excitement of becoming a ‘news breaker’. In this context, we need a much wider awareness exercise, involving all stakeholders, to make every section of the society aware of the laws and regulations as well as the harmful effects of fake posts.\n\nGreater responsibility\n\nSocial media operators should also take a more responsible role. Under the IT Act and the rules notified in April 2011 for social media intermediaries, their liability didn’t arise if they were not responsible for the inception, transmission and reception of content via their networks. With the experience over a decade with this status quo, it is very clear that they need to be made to take more proactive steps and not wait for the law enforcement or judicial references to remove fake content off their platforms or block those senders.\n\nTo a great extent, this would have been possible if the revised guidelines for intermediaries would have been notified by now, as the expanded provisions therein, as circulated earlier, factored a closer responsibility from the intermediaries. Even the revision of the decade-old amended IT Act would have covered the intermediaries’ role closely considering the technology enablement since the last revision.\n\nIn turn, law enforcement agencies need to take action against fake-content generators and transmitters and for that, their capacity has to be widely expanded both in terms of numbers and quality. Some State police forces made arrests recently, but there is a wider need also to look at the existing laws to directly address fake news.\n\nA big section of the digital society would have vouched for an industry-wide self-censorship and weeding regime. In mid-February, such an attempt was announced by a few of the major intermediaries operating in India, such as Facebook and Google, about forming an Information Trust Alliance (ITA) to weed out fake content. This is the time to shape it further and give it more substance and teeth. The fake news flow around Covid-19 gives them more reasons to be seen to be more responsible. They need to expand their network of fact-checkers, which these intermediaries employ individually, till they come with an optimal arrangement.\n\nPrivacy is paramount\n\nAs for privacy violations, the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 (PDPB) is likely to be taken up in the monsoon session of Parliament if the select committee can complete its task. However, it may be mentioned that in August 2018 the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) had released a draft ‘charter of patient rights’ which had factored in the privacy of medical records of patients.\n\nThis was just after MoHFW had drafted the ‘Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act’ (DISHA) and offered it for public comments in March 2018. DISHA was intended to specifically look at the data privacy and confidentiality of digital health data. However, DISHA was subsumed under the PDPB, which is intended to be an encompassing legislation around privacy covering every ministry and situation. It is pertinent to mention here that medical records would be a ‘sensitive personal data’ under PDPB as it is today as defined under the Rules notified under the IT Act in April 2011, and such data cannot be circulated without the explicit permission of the provider.\n\nTo sum up, India has laws and rules to deal with fake news and sensitive personal data circulation online. Efforts are being made to enhance their scope and make them more effective. The IT Act and the rules around the Act have an expansive scope to factor in many situations of violations. In the current situation, there is the additional advantage of the provisions of Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act 2005 (DMA) — which deals with false warnings around a disaster leading to panic.\n\nThe circular of the MHA also mentions the applicability of Sections 505 and 188 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act 1897. Using these provisions, several people have been arrested across States. However, these actions still can’t match the pace at which people post and forward fake posts and violate privacy. The need of the hour is a cocktail of stricter law enforcement as well as an awareness drive through constant messaging and foster and inculcate cyber manners.\n\nThe writer is a former country head of a defence multinational"

            "content": "New Delhi: The southwest monsoon in India is likely to get a boost this year as the India Meteorological Department has predicted that El Nino , which often disrupts rainfall , is unlikely this year.This augurs well for the country as about two-thirds of the people depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihood.The weather office is expected to issue its formal monsoon forecast later in April. Meteorologists say that a low probability of El Nino is certainly good news for the monsoon, although the complex weather system depends on many other factors.If the June-September monsoon is normal, farmers struggling with supply disruption during the lockdown can expect a good summer-sown harvest, which would lift India’s economic sentiment and rural demand for goods including two-wheelers, gold, consumer goods, cars and tractors.The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) refers to the warming of the surface waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The IMD said that although the surface waters are currently warm, they are likely to get neutral over the next three months, according to its Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System.The Australian Bureau of Meteorology said in its bi-monthly ENSO update that the waters are neutral, although it added that forecasts about the phenomenon are not very accurate at this time of the year.Warm ENSO conditions lead to drier weather and thus reduced rainfall. This is also why the IMD predicted most parts of India would have a mean temperature that’s 0.5 degree C to 1 degree C above normal.Another phenomenon called the Indian Ocean Dipole is neutral. The phenomenon refers to the difference in temperatures between different parts of the Indian Ocean. The Indian monsoon is helped by a positive IOD rating, which might be the case in the months ahead.Last year, the IOD turned positive towards the end of June, helping the first week of July with a record level of rainfall.“Of the six international climate models surveyed, most indicate neutral IOD for the coming months. One model briefly reaches positive levels at the end of autumn, while several tend towards negative levels during the southern hemisphere winter,” the Australian weather office said."

            "content": "Coal India Ltd (CIL) was able to achieve 91 per cent of its targeted production of 660 million tonnes (mt) in 2019-20.\n\nAccording to the provisional production and offtake performance numbers shared by CIL to the stock exchanges on Wednesday, it has closed 2019-20 with an annual production of 602.14 mt, which was marginally lower than 606.89 mt of coal produced in FY19.\n\nAs per its MoU with the Coal Ministry during the beginning of FY20, CIL had envisaged an 8.5 per cent growth in production. This was higher than the 7 per cent growth that it had clocked during the previous fiscal taking its total annual production to 606.89 mt.\n\nDuring the January-March 2020 quarter, the country’s largest coal miner recorded close to 10 per cent growth in production to 213.71 mt, against 194.45 mt in the same period last year. CIL registered a 6.5 per cent growth in production at 84.36 mt in March, compared with 79.19 mt in the same period last year.\n\n“After the company’s production was severely impeded on account of excess and prolonged monsoon during the first half of the fiscal, we could recover much of the lost ground in the second half,” a company official said in a press release.\n\nThe company produced 120.28 mt more coal in the second half of the current fiscal than it did in the first half. Against a production of 240.93 mt during April-September 2019, CIL produced 361.21 mt in October 2019 to March 2020, the release said.\n\nThe lower production in FY20 is notwithstanding the fact that two of its subsidiaries — Northern Coalfields and Western Coalfields — surpassed their respective annual production targets for the year, achieving 102 per cent and 103 per cent of their respective targets. While NCL produced 108.05 mt for the fiscal, WCL’s output was 57.64 mt.\n\nSECL witnessed a production decline of over 4 per cent at 150.55 mt (157.35 mt) during the year under review, while MCL’s production declined by nearly 3 per cent to 140.36 mt (144.15 mt).\n\nOfftake dips\n\nDuring FY20, CIL’s offtake was down by a little over 4 per cent to 581.73 mt as against 608.14 mt in the same period last year.\n\nThermal power plants are flush with coal stocks of close to 44.68 mt, which is sufficient for 28 days. Many of the thermal plants have requested CIL to regulate coal supplies to then.\n\n“Importantly, not a single coal fired power plant in the country is in critical or super-critical condition for want of coal on March 31,” the release said.\n\nBesides ensuring steady supply to the power sector, CIL liquidated around 91 per cent of its 5,143 arrear rakes to non-power sector consumers pertaining to years 2017-18 and 2018-19. It has also cleared 4,660 backlog rakes during the fiscal.\n\nCoal India's pithead stock stands at close to 74.56 mt, a comfortable buffer for the ensuing summer months.\n\n“The combined coal stock of 119.24 mt at power plants and at pitheads of CIL is highest ever dispelling any notions of coal shortage in the near future,” the release said."

            "content": "Rahul Sheth Bankar, a grape exporter from Nashik, has invested Rs 3-3.5 lakh in his 20-acre garden on the outskirts of the city.\n\nAfter the extended monsoon caused a huge loss during the last harvest in 2019, Bankar was hoping to make some profits as this year's grape output looked good.\n\nJust as he was harvesting his produce, the government imposed the 21-day nationwide last week to control Covid-19 cases in India.\n\nSuddenly, in a span of few days, his world came crashing down and instead of reaping good profits, Bankar is now working to cut down his losses.\n\n“I am devastated. Despite the fact that mine is largely an export-oriented garden, I ám willing to sell my produce at less than half the rate in the local markets, but no one is willing to buy,’ he sayd over telephone from Nashik. \"Even wine and liquor makers who used to buy my grapes for over Rs 20 a kilogram and not willing to offer even Rs 5 currently.\"\n\n“Being a highly perishable crop, the ripened fruit can't be kept on the vines for long while exporting them is out of question. Despite relaxation of the rules, things are simply not moving on the ground,” he says.\n\n\"When there is restriction on the gathering of more than five persons, how will the orders enabling free movement and resumption of agriculture operations work,\" Bankar asks. \"March 15 to May 15 is the peak season for Indian grape exporters to European nations.\"\n\n\"The main problem is non-availability of transport facilities and labour. Traders who bought grapes for Rs 70 per kg a fortnight ago are now not ready to pay more than Rs 10-12. The local retail market is closed. So we are looking for new markets,\" a PTI report said, quoting Sopan Kanchan, president, All India Grapes Producers Association.\n\nFisheries impacted too\n\nKanchan is not alone. B K Mishra, Managing Director of National Federation of Fisherman’s Cooperative has seen the sector from close quarters for more than 25 years. He says despite best efforts, there is no large-scale selling of fish and the business has come down to just 5-10 per cent of what it was a few weeks back.\n\n“The Rs 45,000 crore fish export business has been badly impacted as no one is willing to venture out in the seas and production is down,” Mishra said.\n\nThe fisheries sector provides direct and indirect employment to almost 16 million people, whose livelihood is now at stake.\n\nAmong the many sector to have been directly and indirectly hit by Covid-19 crisis is farm exports, which also includes dairy and fisheries.\n\nFew takers for buffalo meat\n\nAccording to some reports, before the kicked in, the lucrative buffalo meat export business in India was already staring at almost 50 per cent drop in demand between February 2020 and March 2020 due to falling consumption from Vietnam. A large part of the meat sold to that country eventually makes its way to China.\n\nSince the outbreak was detected in China this January, Indian exporters have received no fresh orders from Asian and middle-eastern markets, which cumulatively account for nearly 65 per cent of the country's direct and routed buffalo meat shipments.\n\nBasmati-rice exports, which have a big share in India’s total farm shipments, have also taken a beating as the world fights The has further impeded the movement of containers and consignments.\n\nThe criticality of farm exports is that they are linked with the well-being of a large segment of farmers, particularly those growing crops that have strong export potential.\n\nThough policy makers have tried several measures, India’s farm exports have risen marginally in the last few years for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe country's stood at $38.73 billion in 2018-19, growing by just 0.8 per cent a year. The growth rate nosedived from 15 per cent in 2017-18.\n\nWhere the problem lies\n\nCommerce Department officials hold the imposition of non-tariff barriers as the prime reason for the volatility in export numbers. Total agro exports stood at $39.33 billion six years ago. Fresh fruits is among the few categories that showed positive growth between 2017-18 and 2018-19.\n\nThe present Covid-19 crisis could further push back exports as road transportation is difficult while ports and airports are highly clogged.\n\nAccording to reports, though the government has allowed round-the-clock customs clearance for three months, apart from implementing other measures to ease the situation, there are other difficulties on ground.\n\nNon-essential shipments have already clogged ports and airports, with agents or brokers not turning up due to unavailability of logistics partners and transportation.\n\nCustoms clearing has also taken as big hit due to the Covid-19 lockdown and the consequent difficulty in the movement of staff.\n\nThe Mumbai Zone Customs Brokers Association in a representation to the Principle Chief Commissioner of Customs appealed for special passes for its employees to attend office, special orders for its employees on guidelines to maintain social distancing and separate means of communication.\n\n“Though customs clearance has been included in special exempted category, ground-level implementation is very problematic,” an official said.\n\nUnless these implementation issues are sorted India’s farm exports could suffer a big jolt in the weeks to come."
