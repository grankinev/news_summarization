Spirits like tequila, gin and pre-mixed cocktails led the way, with sales jumping 75% compared to the same period last year. Wine sales were up 66% while beer sales rose 42%. And online sales far outpaced in-store sales.\n\nNielsen said online alcohol sales were up 243%. Danelle Kosmal, a Nielsen vice president, suspects growth rates peaked that week as people loaded up their pantries before state stay-at-home orders went into effect.\n\nKosmal said data for the week ending March 28 will be a better indicator of ongoing demand.\n\nSome other business fallout:\n\nNEW PURPOSE: Luxury clothing companies, chemical producers, car makers and other companies continue to revamp production to meet pandemic supply demands.\n\nDow, which typically does not produce hand sanitizer, is doing so because the raw materials are readily available to the chemical maker. The majority of the sanitizer will be donated to health systems and government agencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company began making sanitizer at its plant in Stade, Germany. Those operations are being expanded at facilities in Michigan, West Virginia, Belgium and Brazil. The Auburn site has the capacity to produce approximately 15,000 pounds of sanitizer a week, or nearly 30,000 eight-ounce bottles.\n\nFord is repurposing a parts factory west of Detroit to make simple ventilators starting the week of April 20.\n\nBrooks Brothers is converting three U.S. factories to produce up to a total of 150,000 masks per day. It will also begin production on protective gowns. Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. converted its liquid crystal display factory and sent out its first shipment of medical masks Tuesday. The Japanese plant will make 150,000 masks a day, with production being ramped up later to 500,000 masks a day.\n\nAIRLINES: Nine U.S. senators are demanding that airlines make cash refunds to customers whose flights were canceled during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe lawmakers said Tuesday that because Congress gave airlines an “unprecedented bailout” in the economic-relief bill, they have a moral responsibility to provide cash refunds to customers whose flights were canceled and help bring back Americans who are stranded abroad.\n\nSome travelers have complained that airlines offered them only travel vouchers, not cash refunds. Airlines have operated flights, including some chartered by the State Department, to return stranded Americans.\n\n--------- Get breaking news alerts in the FOX5NY News app. It's FREE! Download for iOS or Android ---------\n\nThe letters went to the CEOs of 11 U.S. airlines, including all the majors, from Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and eight Democrats including former presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kamala Harris of California.\n\nA trade group for the airlines did not immediately return a message for comment. American Airlines said if it cancels a flight, customers can get a full refund in the form of their original payment.\n\nMeanwhile, pilots whose medical clearance expires will be allowed to keep flying because going to the doctor for the required exam isn’t an emergency and could spread the new coronavirus. The Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to let pilots fly with expired medical certificates took effect Tuesday and will run through at least June 30. Airline pilots need an exam every six or 12 months depending on age, and other types of pilots need them less often.\n\nSTAY PUT: Travel has almost come to a complete standstill. Airports are empty and Manhattan avenues typically choked with taxis are almost vacant.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration screened 154,080 people Monday, the fewest yet and a drop of more than 93% from last year, when more than 2.3 million people passed through airport checkpoints.\n\nVisa is reporting a rapid slide in travel-related spending by cardholders. It's also noticed a decline in spending on restaurants, entertainment and fuel, according to a regulatory filing. U.S. payments volume is down 4% for the month to date, with credit volume off 7%. Cross-border volume tumbled 19% for the period, on a constant dollar basis.\n\nU.S. gasoline prices have dropped to their lowest levels in four years, and they are almost sure to fall further. Price-tracking services put the national average this week at around $2 a gallon. Some stations were charging under a dollar.\n\nCruise line operator Carnival says it will lose money this year and on Tuesday it suspended dividend payments to conserve cash, according to a regulatory filing. The cruise operator has taken the unprecedented step of a complete shutdown of operations.\n\nIt said that there are about 6,000 passengers on board ships still at sea that are expected to disembark their passengers by the end of April. Some of its crew is unable to return home, and Carnival will be providing them with food and housing, the company said.\n\nMARKETS: Wall Street stocks fell Tuesday in relatively trading. The surge of coronavirus cases around the world has sent markets to breathtaking drops since mid-February, and the quarter looks to be the worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nENDING PURSUIT: Xerox says it is withdrawing its bid to purchase computer and printer maker HP due to the global economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nXerox said in February that it planned to offer nearly $35 billion for HP after a lower bid was rejected as undervalued.\n\nThe companies have struggled as the demand for printed documents and ink have waned, and both had been cutting costs even before the global pandemic.\n\nHOME-COOKED IS KING: British supermarkets just had their busiest month in recorded history.\n\nNew figures released Tuesday by market research firm Kantar show that British grocery sales jumped by 20.6% in March compared with a year earlier, making it the fastest rate of growth on record. Grocery sales totaled 10.8 billion pounds ($13.3 billion) over the past four weeks, surpassing the level seen during the busy Christmas season. The average household bought the equivalent of five extra days of groceries.\n\nConagra is reporting “significantly elevated demand,\" with shipments up approximately 50% in the current quarter."

            "content": "A pedestrian in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn on March 28, 2020. Fears are growing that the worldwide economic downturn delivered by the coronavirus pandemic could be especially deep and lengthy, with recovery limited by continued anxiety. (Victor J. Blue/The New York Times) A pedestrian in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn on March 28, 2020. Fears are growing that the worldwide economic downturn delivered by the coronavirus pandemic could be especially deep and lengthy, with recovery limited by continued anxiety. (Victor J. Blue/The New York Times)\n\nWritten by Peter S. Goodman\n\nThe world is almost certainly ensnared in a devastating recession delivered by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNow, fears are growing that the downturn could be far more punishing and long lasting than initially feared — potentially enduring into next year, and even beyond — as governments intensify restrictions on business to halt the spread of the pandemic, and as fear of the virus reconfigures the very concept of public space, impeding consumer-led economic growth.\n\nThe pandemic is above all a public health emergency. So long as human interaction remains dangerous, business cannot responsibly return to normal. And what was normal before may not be anymore. People may be less inclined to jam into crowded restaurants and concert halls even after the virus is contained.\n\nThe abrupt halt of commercial activity threatens to impose economic pain so profound and enduring in every region of the world at once that recovery could take years. The losses to companies, many already saturated with debt, risk triggering a financial crisis of cataclysmic proportions.\n\nStock markets have reflected the economic alarm. The S&P 500 in the United States fell more than 4% Wednesday as investors braced for worse conditions ahead. That followed a brutal March, during which a whipsawing S&P 500 fell 12.5%, in its worst month since October 2008.\n\n“I feel like the 2008 financial crisis was just a dry run for this,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of a history of financial crises, “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.”\n\n“This is already shaping up as the deepest dive on record for the global economy for over 100 years,” he said. “Everything depends on how long it lasts, but if this goes on for a long time, it’s certainly going to be the mother of all financial crises.”\n\nThe situation looks uniquely dire in developing countries, which have seen investment rush for the exits this year, sending currencies plummeting, forcing people to pay more for imported food and fuel, and threatening governments with insolvency — all of this while the pandemic itself threatens to overwhelm inadequate medical systems.\n\nAmong investors, a hopeful scenario holds currency: The recession will be painful but short-lived, giving way to a robust recovery this year. The global economy is in a temporary deep freeze, the logic goes. Once the virus is contained, enabling people to return to offices and shopping malls, life will snap back to normal. Jets will fill with families going on merely deferred vacations. Factories will resume, fulfilling saved up orders.\n\nBut even after the virus is tamed — and no one really knows when that will be — the world that emerges is likely to be choked with trouble, challenging the recovery. Mass joblessness exacts societal costs. Widespread bankruptcy could leave industry in a weakened state, depleted of investment and innovation.\n\nHouseholds may remain agitated and risk averse, making them prone to thrift. Some social distancing measures could remain indefinitely. Consumer spending amounts to roughly two-thirds of economic activity worldwide. If anxiety endures and people are reluctant to spend, expansion will be limited — especially as continued vigilance against the coronavirus may be required for years.\n\n“The psychology won’t just bounce back,” said Charles Dumas, chief economist at TS Lombard, an investment research firm in London. “People have had a real shock. The recovery will be slow, and certain behavior patterns are going to change, if not forever at least for a long while.”\n\nRising stock prices in the United States have in recent years propelled spending. Millions of people are now filing claims for unemployment benefits, while wealthier households are absorbing the reality of substantially diminished retirement savings.\n\nAmericans boosted their rates of savings significantly in the years after the Great Depression. Fear and tarnished credit limited reliance on borrowing. That could happen again.\n\n“The loss of income on the labor front is tremendous,” Dumas said. “The loss of value in the wealth effect is also very strong.”\n\nThe sense of alarm is enhanced by the fact that every inhabited part of the globe is now in trouble.\n\nThe United States, the world’s largest economy, is almost certainly in a recession. So is Europe. So probably are significant economies like Canada, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. China, the world’s second-largest economy, is expected to grow by only 2% this year, according to TS Lombard, the research firm.\n\nFor years, a segment of the economic orthodoxy advanced the notion that globalization came with a built-in insurance policy against collective disaster. So long as some part of the world economy was growing, that supposedly moderated the effect of a downturn in any one country.\n\nThe global recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008 beggared that thesis. The current downturn presents an even more extreme event — a worldwide emergency that has left no safe haven.\n\nWhen the pandemic emerged, initially in central China, it was viewed as a substantial threat to that economy. Even as China closed itself off, conventional wisdom held that, at worst, large international companies like Apple and General Motors would suffer lost sales to Chinese consumers, while manufacturers elsewhere would struggle to secure parts made in Chinese factories.\n\nBut then the pandemic spread to Italy and eventually across Europe, threatening factories on the continent. Then came government policies that essentially locked down modern life, business included, while the virus spread to the United States.\n\n“Now, anywhere you look in the global economy we are seeing a hit to domestic demand on top of those supply chain impacts,” said Innes McFee, managing director of macro and investor services at Oxford Economics in London. “It’s incredibly worrying.”\n\nOxford Economics estimates that the global economy will contract marginally this year, before improving by June. But this view is likely to be revised down sharply, McFee said.\n\nTrillions of dollars in credit and loan guarantees dispensed by central banks and governments in the United States and Europe have perhaps cushioned the most developed economies. That may prevent large numbers of businesses from failing, say economists, while ensuring that workers who lose jobs will be able to stay current on their bills.\n\n“I am attached to the notion that this is a temporary crisis,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. “You hit the pause button, and then you hit the start button, and the machine starts running again.”\n\nBut that depends on the rescue packages proving effective — no sure thing. In the typical economic shock, government spends money to try to encourage people to go out and spend. In this crisis, the authorities are demanding that people stay inside to limit the virus.\n\n“The longer this goes on, the more likely it is that there will be destruction of productive capacity,” Owens Thomsen said. “Then, the nature of the crisis morphs from temporary to something a bit more lasting.”\n\nWorldwide, foreign direct investment is on track to decline by 40% this year, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. This threatens “lasting damage to global production networks and supply chains,” said the body’s director of investment and enterprise, James Zhan.\n\n“It will likely take two to three years for most economies to return to their pre-pandemic levels of output,” IHS Markit said in a recent research note.\n\nIn developing countries, the consequences are already severe. Not only is capital fleeing, but a plunge in commodity prices — especially oil — is assailing many countries, among them Mexico, Chile and Nigeria. China’s slowdown is rippling out to countries that supply Chinese factories with components, from Indonesia to South Korea.\n\nBetween now and the end of next year, developing countries are on the hook to repay some $2.7 trillion in debt, according to a report released Monday by the U.N. trade body. In normal times, they could afford to roll most of that debt into new loans. But the abrupt exodus of money has prompted investors to charge higher rates of interest for new loans.\n\nThe U.N. body called for a $2.5 trillion rescue for developing countries — $1 trillion in loans from the International Monetary Fund, another $1 trillion in debt forgiveness from a broad range of creditors and $500 billion for health recovery.\n\n“The great fear we have for developing countries is that the economic shocks have actually hit most of them before the health shocks have really begin to hit,” said Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the division on globalization and development strategies at the U.N. trade body in Geneva.\n\nIn the most optimistic view, the fix is already underway. China has effectively contained the virus and is beginning to get back to work, though gradually. If Chinese factories spring back to life, that will ripple out across the globe, generating demand for computer chips made in Taiwan, copper mined in Zambia and soybeans grown in Argentina.\n\nBut China’s industry is not immune to global reality. Chinese consumers are an increasingly powerful force, yet cannot spur a full recovery. If Americans are still contending with the pandemic, if South Africa cannot borrow on world markets and if Europe is in recession, that will limit the appetite for Chinese wares.\n\n“If Chinese manufacturing comes back, who exactly are they selling to?” asked Rogoff, the economist. “How can global growth not take a long-term hit?”\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "content": "Soft commodities can be the most volatile sector of the commodities market as prices routinely double, triple, or halve in value during their pricing cycles. The path of least resistance for the prices of luxury commodities is a function of the weather and crop diseases in the critical growing areas around the world. However, the demand side of the fundamental equation reflects an ever-increasing addressable market for these products as the population of the world is growing by 15-20 million people each quarter. Since 2000, the number of people inhabiting our planet has increased by approximately 27.3%, which amounts to over 1.640 billion people, according to the US Census Bureau. More people with more money consuming more coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, and orange juice each day underpins the prices of these commodities. However, the outbreak of Coronavirus in Q1 weighed on all markets, and soft commodities were no exception.\n\nThe composite of five soft commodities, sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton, and frozen concentrated orange juice, posted two straight years of gains in 2015 and 2016. At the end of 2017, soft commodities were down just 2.25% on the year. In 2018, they finished with a loss of 5.68%. In 2019 the soft commodities sector moved 3.47% to the upside. In Q1 2020, soft commodities posted an 8.79% loss for the three months.\n\nThe dollar index moved 3.16% higher in Q1, which weighed on the prices of all commodities. The dollar moved considerably higher against the Brazilian real in 2018, and the real remained weak throughout 2019 with other emerging market currencies. In Q1, the real fell to a new and lower low below the $0.20 level. Brazil is the world’s leading producer of three of the five commodities in the sector, including sugar, coffee, and oranges. The weak real was not supportive of the prices of the three products in Q1 as it fell below the bottom end of its trading range. The dollar is the reserve currency of the world and the benchmark pricing mechanism for most commodities, including those of the soft or tropical variety. However, the weather is always the most critical issue when it comes to annual crop sizes and the direction of prices.\n\nLike all agricultural commodities, demographics continue to provide an ever-increasing base of support for these food products. With wealth rising in the world’s most populous county, China, competition for food continues to increase, which puts a strain on supplies. As we head into Q2, it will be the weather and crop issues that determine the path of least resistance of prices as demand will continue to favor higher lows. However, the impact of demand can be slow and steady while supply gluts or deficits tend to shock markets and cause the most significant price moves on both the up and the downside. The outbreak of a global pandemic that caused a deflationary spiral in Q1 will continue to impact the demand for soft commodities in Q2. At the same time, the potential for export problems from producing countries, particularly in South America and Asia, could create shortages that would increase price volatility. Bullish and bearish factors face most of the commodities in the sector, going into the second quarter of 2020.\n\nWhile there are ETF/ETN products for four of the five soft commodities, the Invesco DB Agriculture product (DBA) includes just under a 19% exposure to the three of the most active in the sector as it holds positions in sugar, coffee, and cocoa futures contracts. The soft commodity sector rose in Q4 and 2019. However, Q1 presented a unique set of challenges for the sector. The prospects for Q2 depend on the weather, the overall state of supplies, currency markets, and, most significantly, the global pandemic.\n\nSugar Review\n\nSugar was 28.02% higher in 2016 and gained 4.96% in 2015. In 2017, the price of sugar lost a total of 22.3% of its value. Sugar was 20.65% lower in 2018 compared to the closing price at the end of 2017. In 2019, sugar was 11.55% higher. Ample supplies of sugar had caused the commodity to make a series of lower highs and lower lows from 2011 through August 2015 when the sweet commodity traded down to 10.13 cents per pound. Sugar then proceeded to rally, making a series of higher lows and higher highs culminating with the highs in late September 2016 at 23.90 cents per pound. From late 2016 through the end of September 2018, the sweet commodity moved lower, making a series of lower lows reaching a bottom at 9.83 cents per pound on the nearby ICE world sugar futures contract in late September 2018, as the nearby ICE futures contract was expiring. Sugar rebounded to 14.24 in October 2018. In 2019, the price dropped to a higher low of 10.68 in September before moving steadily higher to a higher high of 15.90 cents in mid-February. Risk-off conditions in all markets pushed the price to a low of 10.40 at the end of March. Sugar traded in a range of 10.40 to 15.90 cents in Q1 2020. Nearby sugar futures that trade on the ICE settled on March 31, 2020, at 10.42 cents per pound as it moved 22.35% lower in Q1 and settled near the low for the period.\n\nIn Brazil, the weakness of their currency, the real, contributed to a depressed sugar price. The Brazilian real declined from $0.25050 against the US dollar at the end of Q4 2019 to $0.19185 at the end of Q1 2020. At the same time, crude oil plunged from $61.06 per barrel at the end of Q4 to the $20.48 level at the end of Q1, which was an extremely bearish factor for the price of sugar since it is the primary ingredient in the production of alternative fuel in Brazil. Gasoline fell to the lowest price of this century on demand destruction during a deflationary spiral.\n\nMeanwhile, this year, sugar rose to a high of 15.90 per pound in early February as drought conditions in Thailand stoked fears of supply shortages. The sweet commodity rose to its highest level since May 2017 before risk-off conditions caused the sharp correction to 10.44 cents per pound in March. A toxic bearish cocktail of a decline in the Brazilian real, plunging gasoline prices, and risk-off conditions pushed the price of sugar back towards the multiyear low. However, the sweet commodity held above the 10 cents per pound level.\n\nSource: CQG\n\nAs the weekly chart illustrates, price momentum was heading into oversold territory at the end of Q1. In Q1, drought conditions in Thailand lifted the price to 15.90 cents before risk-off conditions created by the Coronavirus sent the price lower.\n\nAt a time when demand destruction gripped the crude oil market, OPEC and Russia decided to flood the market with the energy commodity. Crude oil dropped to below $20 per barrel, and gasoline below 40 cents per gallon on the nearby futures contract. The combination of factors weighed on the price of sugar and sent the price from 15.90 to 10.40 cents per pound on the nearby futures contract. Sugar ended the first quarter at the low as Coronavirus continues to be the worst pandemic to grip the world since the 1918 Spanish flu and price of crude oil remained near the low.\n\nSugar can be one of the most volatile commodities that trade; in past years, daily historical volatility had exceeded 100%. At the end of Q1, daily historical volatility stood at 32.28%, which was 20.94% higher than it was on the final day of trading in Q4 2019. As we move forward into Q2, technical support for sugar stands at 9.83 cents per pound, with resistance at 15.90 cents per pound, the Q1 peak.\n\nCoffee Review\n\nCoffee was the number one, the best-performing commodity of 2014, registering a gain of 43.19%. In 2015 it was the worst-performing soft commodity. Coffee futures fell 23.95% in 2015 but recovered by 8.17% in 2016. In 2017, the price of coffee moved 7.92% lower. The price of coffee moved 19.29% lower in 2018. In 2019, coffee futures moved 27.34% higher. In Q1, the price of coffee declined by 7.83%. Nearby ICE coffee futures closed on March 31, 2020, at $1.1955 per pound. The price range in Q1 was from $0.9740 on the lows to $1.3310 on the highs. Coffee declined from January through early February and recovered in February and March and closed the quarter above the midpoint of the trading range for the period.\n\nSource: CQG\n\nThe weekly chart highlights that coffee futures had been in a bear market since November 2016. In Q4 2018, coffee violated the pattern of lower highs, and lower lows as the price rose to $1.2550 and above a level of technical resistance at the early June 2018 high at $1.2495 before turning lower once again. In Q4 2019, the price rose significantly above the October 2018 high. At the end of Q1 2020, coffee futures were working their way back towards the late 2019 peak. Meanwhile, price momentum and relative strength on the weekly chart were just above neutral readings at the end of Q1.\n\nCocoa Review\n\nCocoa was the best performer in the soft commodity sector in 2015. Cocoa was the only commodity that posted a double-digit gain in 2015 and won the gold medal for performance across all of the raw material markets that I cover. Cocoa was the worst-performing soft commodity and the worst-performing commodity of all in 2016, posting a loss of 33.79%, and the losing continued in 2017 with a decline of 11.01%. Cocoa moved 27.7% higher in 2018, making it the best-performing soft commodity of the year. Cocoa gained 5.13% higher in 2019. In Q1, cocoa traded in a wide range but fell 11.46%. As of the close of business on March 31, 2020, nearby ICE cocoa futures were trading at $2249 per ton. Cocoa futures traded in a range of $2183-$2998 per ton in Q1 and closed not far off the low.\n\nSource: CQG\n\nThe weekly chart of ICE cocoa futures illustrates that cocoa has made higher lows and higher highs with the most recent peak coming in mid-February during Q1. The Ivory Coast and Ghana have been working with the world’s leading chocolate manufacturers on a $400 per ton surcharge on cocoa beans from the West African nations. Cocoa fell as risk-off conditions on the back of the Coronavirus sent the prices of most commodities lower.\n\nAt the same time, since cocoa is the primary revenue-producing commodity in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, child labor in those countries poses a moral dilemma for chocolate manufacturing companies and western governments in the US and Europe. A move to stop the number of children involved in the production process could increase the price of the soft commodity via the surcharge. Meanwhile, as Coronavirus impacts Africa, it could cause production and logistical problems and curtail global supplies.\n\nCotton Review\n\nCotton was the worst-performing soft commodity in 2014; it moved 27.33% lower for the year. In 2015, the price of cotton appreciated by 4.99%, and in 2016, cotton gained 11.65%. Cotton moved 11.3% higher in 2017. Nearby ICE cotton futures moved 8.18% lower in 2018. In 2019, the price of cotton moved 4.36% lower. Cotton was the worst-performing soft commodity in Q1 as the price fell 25.95%.\n\nSource: CQG\n\nAs the weekly chart highlights, in Q1, cotton futures fell to a new low of 48.40 cents per pound, the lowest price since 2009. Nearby ICE cotton futures settled on March 31, 2020, at 51.13 cents per pound, not far off the low.\n\nCotton is a highly volatile commodity, and in March 2011, cotton traded up to an all-time high of $2.27 per pound on supply shortages. Following the all-time high, the price moved progressively lower until finding a low at 55.66 cents in March 2016. In Q1 2020, the risk-off conditions on the back of Coronavirus took the price below the 2016 low and to a level not seen in eleven years.\n\nChina and India are significant factors for the cotton market due to their domination when it comes to supply and demand for the fiber. Meanwhile, economic contraction could weigh on the demand for garments. Coronavirus sent the price lower but could also set the stage for a future supply shortage if producers cut back on production.\n\nThe state of the global economy and the weather conditions in growing regions in the second quarter will be the critical factors when it comes to the price direction of cotton futures on the Intercontinental Exchange. However, the stop in business activity in Q1 is likely to cause inventories to rise and the price of the fiber to continue to drift lower until it finds the bottom end of its pricing cycle.\n\nFrozen Concentrated Orange Juice Review\n\nTrading FCOJ futures is a frantic business; I would not recommend it to anyone because of the lack of liquidity. The orange juice futures market edged lower in Q4 2019. FCOJ was virtually unchanged in 2015, falling by only 0.04%. In 2016, FCOJ gained 41.50%, making it the best performing soft commodity. FCOJ moved 31.35% lower in 2017. FCOJ futures fell 7.98% in 2018. The soft commodity was 22.33% lower in 2019, making it the worst-performing soft commodity for the quarter and year. As often occurs, the worst performance during one period becomes the best the next. In Q1 2020, FCOJ futures posted a 23.66% gain making it the leader of the soft commodity sector and when compared to all of the other futures markets in the asset class. Orange juice traded in a range of $0.9120 to a high of $1.2255 per pound in Q1. FCOJ settled on March 31, 2020, at $1.2020 per pound.\n\nSource: CQG\n\nAs the weekly chart highlights, FCOJ futures had made lower highs and lower lows since June 2018. Brazil is the world’s leading orange producing nation. The lower level of the Brazilian currency, the real, weighed on the price of FCOJ in 2018 and 2019. At the end of Q1 2020, FCOJ broke out to the upside after trading in a consolidation pattern since May 2019. Over the past 40-plus years, FCOJ futures had traded as low as 37.4 cents and as high as $2.35 per pound. In Q4 of 2016, OJ rose to the highest level in history. Most recently, the FCOJ price rose to over the $1.70 level because of a shortage of oranges from Brazil, the world’s leading producer of the citrus fruit in May 2018, but the price traded around the $1 per pound level May 2019 through March 2020 when it broke out to the upside at the end of Q1.\n\nOJ is a thin and illiquid market that is dangerous as it is susceptible to price gaps when the price is moving. The price below the $1 per pound level became unsustainable.\n\nThe bottom line and a quick look at lumber\n\nFour of the five soft commodity prices moved lower in Q1. FCOJ was the star performer, but it rallied without the help of the Brazilian currency. However, supply chain issues in Brazil could have prompted the price appreciation. Cotton was the worst-performing soft commodity as the price dropped to the lowest level since 2009 on the back of the outbreak of Coronavirus. Sugar and cocoa also posted double-digit percentage losses, while coffee also fell. The weak Brazilian real was not a supportive factor for coffee and sugar prices.\n\nThe potential for supply issues is always a danger when it comes to these agricultural commodities markets. The global economic meltdown in Q1 could cause supply chain problems as well as production issues when it comes to labor in producing nations. We are likely to see continued price volatility in all markets in Q2, and soft commodities are no exception.\n\nThe lumber market posted a significant double-digit percentage loss in Q1, as the price put in a bearish reversal on the quarterly chart on the back of the global pandemic. In mid-May 2018, lumber futures traded to a new all-time high when the price reached $659.00 per 1,000 board feet surpassing the February peak at $536.20 and the 1993 previous record high at $493.50.\n\nSource: CQG\n\nThe long-term quarterly chart shows that lumber had been moving higher since September 2015 when the price found a bottom at $214.40 per 1,000 board feet. Lumber had been making higher lows since 2009 when the price trade to $137.90. The wood market gained 28.72% in 2016 and did even better in 2017, rising by 36%. After reaching a record high at $659 per 1,000 board feet in May 2018, the lumber market plunged and finished 2018 with a 25.78% year-on-year loss. In 2019 lumber moved 21.89%. In Q1 2020, the price fell 31.29%. The price of nearby lumber futures closed on March 31, 2020, at $278.50 per 1,000 board feet. In Q1, lumber traded in a wide range from $278.50 to $477.70 per 1,000 board feet and closed at the end of March at the low of its trading band for the year, which points to further declines.\n\nLower interest rates in the US typically increase the demand for new home construction, which translates into more demand for wood, which is a critical industrial commodity. However, rates have dropped to historic lows, and the deflationary spiral has weighed on the need for and price of lumber.\n\nLumber is not a liquid market, and I would discourage anyone from trading in this market. However, lumber is a vital benchmark commodity, and it behooves all investors to monitor the price action as it provides clues about economic conditions and demand for industrial raw materials.\n\nSoft commodities prices are some of the most volatile in all of the sectors of the raw materials asset class. These commodities tend to move to the top and bottom ends of their pricing cycles often, and the weather conditions around the world, along with crop diseases and acts of nature can wipe out annual crops in the blink of an eye at times. The virus presents another set of challenges for the agricultural products from production to the supply chain.\n\nThe Invesco DB Agriculture product (DBA) includes an almost 19% exposure to the three most active soft commodities as it holds positions in sugar, coffee, and cocoa futures contracts. The fund summary for DBA states:\n\n“The investment seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the DBIQ Diversified Agriculture Index Excess Return™ (the “index”) over time, plus the excess, if any, of the sum of the fund’s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, over the expenses of the fund. The index, which is comprised of one or more underlying commodities (“index commodities”), is intended to reflect the agricultural sector. The fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio of exchange-traded futures.”\n\nThe most recent top holdings of DBA include:\n\nThe soft commodities sector posted an 8.78% loss in Q1 2020.\n\nSource: Barchart\n\nAs the chart of DBA illustrates, it moved from $16.56 at the end of Q4 to $14.07 at the end of Q1 2020, a decline of $2.49 or 15.04%. Declines in some of the other agricultural commodities weighed on the performance of DBA in Q1. Moreover, the cost of rolling futures contracts in contango markets is a cost that the ETF product passes on to holders.\n\nThe one constant in all of these agricultural commodities is that the growing world population continues to underpin prices. As demand rises each year, the world depends on growing supplies. In years where production is abundant, prices do not feel the impact of the rising demand. However, when shortages develop, price action can become explosive. The global pandemic will present new challenges for many members of the sector.\n\nAny investment involves substantial risks, including, but not limited to, pricing volatility, inadequate liquidity, and the potential complete loss of principal.

Trump warned US citizens that the next couple of weeks are going to be \"horrific,\" as the country grapples with the outbreak amid predictions of up to 200,000 deaths.\n\nAbout ventilators, the US will soon have an excess, which it will be distributing to other countries, the president said during his daily briefing.

The British author said her new platform \"Harry Potter at Home\" was aimed at children unable to attend school during these unprecedented times.\n\nThe website includes links to free versions of the first in the Potter series, the 1997 novel \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" available as an e-book or audio book in a number of different languages.

People are welcome to improvise masks in the absence of factory-produced ones, he added.\n\nThe prime minister also said that approaching religious holidays, including the Jewish holiday of Passover, should be celebrated with immediate family members only.\n\nThus far, Israel has reported over 6,000 cases of coronavirus and 24 related fatalities.\n\nMedical facilities around the globe are already struggling to acquire the number of masks needed to handle the influx of coronavirus patients. The problem is bound to be exacerbated as more and more governments require their citizens to wear such masks in public. State and private entities are scrambling to ramp up production to meet the sudden demand.\n\n18:10 More evidence has come out showing that coronavirus infections are being spread by people who do not display obvious symptoms, adding complications to efforts to bring the outbreak under control.\n\nAround 10% of new infections may be caused by people who have the infection but do not experience systems, a study conducted by researchers in Singapore and published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday suggests.\n\nRead more: Up to 30% of coronavirus cases asymptomatic\n\nThe revelations caused the CDC to change its guidance to say that anyone may be considered a coronavirus carrier, regardless of whether they display symptoms.\n\nAn earlier study in China's Hubei province, where the respiratory disease originated, suggested that over 10% of infections may have occurred before people displayed symptoms.\n\nResearchers are also looking into the possibility that infections can also be spread by people who have the illness, recovered, but are still contagious.\n\n16:39 The US state of New York has reported a total of 1,941 coronavirus deaths, up from 1,550 the day before. New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the US, now has 83,712 confirmed cases of coronavirus, compared to 75,795 reported as of Tuesday.

If a husband is careless, so the wife has the right to refrain from him,\" the cleric said.\n\nThe kingdom has reported 1,720 coronavirus infections and 16 fatalities. Around 93% of the country's 30 million inhabitants are Muslim.\n\n15:55 A worldwide food shortage could occur if the coronavirus crisis isn't handled properly, three global agencies warned on Wednesday.\n\n\"Uncertainty about food availability can spark a wave of export restrictions, creating a shortage on the global market,\" said a joint statement signed by Qu Dongyu, head of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roberto Azevedo, director of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nRead more: Will coronavirus spark a wave of food nationalism?\n\nGovernment lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus, which have closed national borders and kept workers at home, have created a significant lag in international food supply chains, while panic buying and hoarding has already left supermarket shelves bear in recent weeks.\n\n\"In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdowns, every effort must be made to ensure that trade flows as freely as possible, specially to avoid food shortage(s)\" from developing, the statement said.\n\n\"When acting to protect the health and well-being of their citizens, countries should ensure that any trade-related measures do not disrupt the food supply chain,\" it added.\n\nThe statement may have been directed at Moscow, where officials are considering restricting wheat exports from Russia to keep prices from spiking there.\n\n\"Such disruptions including hampering the movement of agricultural and food industry workers and extending border delays for food containers, result in the spoilage of perishables and increasing food waste,\" the statement said.\n\n15:50 Germany's Greens have voiced support for the development of a tracking app to monitor people infected with the coronavirus — albeit with certain restrictions.\n\nKonstantin von Notz, the internal affairs spokesperson for the Greens, told DW that the app currently being developed by German researchers would not be used to track people who are infected and would be used on a \"voluntary basis.\"\n\nWatch video 01:37 Germany aims to launch coronavirus tracing app\n\nThe app that currently being worked on by German researchers would monitor people who are infected with the virus, anonymously storing the data on the amount of time the person spent with others and to alert them that they should potentially get tested. Von Notz emphasized that the app would only save the contact data of others who have the app.\n\n\"That, if done correctly in a detailed way, is a data-efficient solution and an effective way of finding out who might have been potentially infected,\" von Notz said.\n\nHe warned, however, that the app would not be able to — and shouldn't be able to — let people know whether the person standing next to them in line at the grocery store is infected.\n\nRead more: Will Germans trade privacy for coronavirus protection?\n\nFollowing a phone conference with state leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also spoke in favor of tracking apps.\n\n\"It's clear that it would be on a voluntary basis, but if the testing of these apps shows them to be good and set to be successful in better tracing cases of where there has been contact, I'd certainly be in favor of recommending that to citizens,\" she said.\n\n\"I would of course also be prepared to use it myself to perhaps help other people,\" she added.\n\n1540 In Israel, the defense minister on Wednesday appeared to tie potential coronavirus aid for the Gaza Strip to an attempt to get back the remains of two Israeli soldiers who died in 2014.\n\nGaza, which currently has 12 reported cases of coronavirus, has just 96 ventilators for its population of 2 million. The impoverished Palestinian territory does not have the infrastructure to contain an outbreak.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett told reporters that it would \"not be right\" to disconnect aid for Gaza from Israel recovering the soldiers' remains.\n\n\"The moment there is talk of the humanitarian world in Gaza. Israel also has humanitarian needs, which are mainly the recovery of the fallen,\" Bennett of the soldiers whose remains are being held by Hamas, Gaza's Islamist governing authority.\n\nIt was unclear whether Bennett was referring to the possibility of Israel providing aid directly, or of the country allowing the transfer of aid over its borders.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum rejected the idea. \"Israel bears responsibility for any consequences should the disease spread in Gaza because it has been blockading it for 13 years,\" he said. \"A prisoner swap deal is a separate track.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli authorities are also considering a full lockdown for the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak, a crowded ultra-Orthodox suburb with around 730 known cases of coronavirus.\n\nThe suburb of 200,000 has the second-highest number of infections in the country after Jerusalem. The government fears that the ultra-Orthodox community is continuing to meet for large gatherings despite a ban on doing so. On Saturday, some 400 people attended a rabbi’s funeral.

The shops are closed. Even a healthy company like Adidas cannot stand this for long,\" Adidas said in an open letter sent to several media outlets.\n\nThe German sportswear giant said it understood criticism levied against it from customers and politicians alike.\n\n\"We would, therefore, like to apologize to you formally. We have paid our landlords the rent for April,\" Adidas said.\n\n13:13 In France, the death toll rose to over 4,000 with many of those who died coming from the eastern region of Grand Est, along the border with Germany.

It thus far has a much higher death rate, with 12,428 fatalities.\n\nGlobally, there have been 873,767 infection cases and 43,228 deaths as a result of the pandemic.\n\n10:33 In an interview with DW, Jan Egeland, Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said refugee camps require global solidarity to tackle coronavirus, stressing that as long as the virus can spread to the more vulnerable, the coronavirus pandemic can never be dealt with.\n\nWatch video 01:10 Egeland: 'We're overwhelmed, we're overstretched'\n\nEgeland warned that the highly contagious virus poses a significant threat to refugees, as the virus can thrive in congested camps and settlements. He said the NRC is working to provide more handwashing facilities, more water and sanitation to camps in Afghanistan, in Iran and in 30 other countries.\n\n\"We're overwhelmed, overstretched … There must be more injection of humanitarian aid,\" Egeland said.\n\nThe non-governmental organization is also trying to provide more space for refugees so they have physical distance from each other.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: Urgent appeal for evacuation of Greek refugee camps\n\nWatch video 01:44 Share Coronavirus looms over Lesbos refugee camp Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3aBCr Coronavirus catastrophe looms over Lesbos refugee camp\n\n10:15 Japan is on the brink of crisis, with medical experts particularly worried about preparations for an upsurge in coronavirus cases in Tokyo, officials say.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that controlling the virus was a top priority. He said the Japanese government would do \"whatever is needed.\"\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has shied away from declaring a state of emergency. Even if it were declared, he said, it would not mean he could order an immediate nationwide lockdown of cities, such as in France. Any emergency declaration would allow prefectural governors to make necessary requests and give orders, he said.\n\nAbe said that even if Japan could avoid an explosive spread of the coronavirus, the country was expected to \"remain on the brink for a long time.\"\n\nJapan has some 2,229 COVID-19 cases and 57 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University — far lower than numbers from the United States, Europe and China. However, new infections continue to set fresh daily records.\n\nRead more: Tokyo 2020 postponement poses Herculean financial challenge\n\n09:52 The number of coronavirus infections in Spain has risen to 102,136, the Health Ministry announced Wednesday.

Fatalities rose over 24 hours from 8,189 to 9,053 — a record daily rise of 864 individuals.\n\n09:36 The Italian government is extending its emergency coronavirus lockdown through April 13, the health minister confirmed to lawmakers.\n\nThe economically debilitating lockdown has seen nationwide business and school closures, a ban on public gatherings, factory closures and severe travel restrictions.\n\n\"The country is at a standstill and we must maintain the least amount of activity possible to ensure the survival of all,\" civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli told reporters.\n\nItaly's death toll — the highest in the world — stood at 12,428 on Tuesday.\n\nThe country's outbreak began on February 20. Its 60 million people have been under lockdown since March 10.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: Italy launches mental health service for lockdown\n\n09:02 As of today, shoppers visiting supermarkets and drug stores in Austria will only be permitted to enter if they are wearing a face mask, in accordance with new government measures.\n\nAustria's Health Ministry has given stores until April 6 at the latest to begin implementing the new restrictions. A mask must be provided to shoppers upon entry; alternatively, customers will be allowed to wear their own mask.\n\nThe biggest challenge for stores would be sourcing the up to 4 million masks per day, Rainer Will, head of the country's trade association, told Austrian public broadcaster ORF.\n\nA spokesperson for the grocery store chain Spar called on customers in Austria to stagger their store-visiting times, Bavarian broadcaster BR24 reported.\n\nFace masks are in short global supply, with reports of frontline medical workers in some countries being told to share face masks and other protective gear.\n\nPamela Fidler-Stolz, reporting for Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung, was handed a mask on entry at her local supermarket and said it was very straight-forward: \"It was very relaxed and there was enough masks: One store worker controlled the entry of customers, and asked each person to take a mask out the stand on entry.\"\n\n07:56 The UK is aiming to increase the number of tests for coronavirus to 25,000 a day by the middle of April from its current capacity of 12,750 a day, Housing Minister Robert Jenrick told Sky News on Wednesday.\n\nThe UK is beginning to test medical staff in addition to patients in hospitals. According to Jenrick, 8,240 individuals were tested on Monday and more than 900 health workers were tested over the weekend.\n\nThere are currently 25,481 positive cases in the UK, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nGuidelines for coronavirus testing vary from country to country. Countries where testing is only being done on patients with severe symptoms are believed to have a larger number of unknown cases.\n\nSouth Korea took the lead in widespread coronavirus testing, and many attribute Germany's broad testing to the country's low fatality rate. Virologist Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the coronavirus at Berlin's Charite hospital, has estimated that Germany is now capable of carrying out 500,000 coronavirus tests a week.\n\nRead more: Is comparing coronavirus death rates futile?\n\n07:39 Colombia confirmed its first coronavirus cases among the country's indigenous people, Reuters reported, citing local authorities. Two people from the Yukpa group, who live in makeshift shelters in an impoverished area on the northern border, tested positive.\n\nIn Brazil, the Amazonas state has become the first in the country to register a case of the coronavirus among indigenous people, Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported, citing Brazil's secretary of health. A 19-year-old Kokama woman tested positive for the virus. The patient lives in Santo Antonio do Ica, a municipality located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the border with Colombia.\n\nIndigenous leaders from across Latin America on Monday called for protection against the coronavirus, warning that the disease poses an \"existential threat\" to their communities.\n\n\"Indigenous people living in voluntary isolation are especially vulnerable to infectious disease as they don't have any immunity at all against most diseases,\" said Claudette Labonte, from the Congress of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin.\n\n07:18 Saudi Arabia has urged Muslims to wait before making plans to take part in the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, as the nation is still evaluating safety measures related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Muhammad Saleh bin Taher Banten, the Saudi minister for the hajj, told state TV on Tuesday.\n\nThe kingdom currently has over 1,500 cases. It has already barred individuals from entering the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nUp to 2 million Muslims perform the yearly pilgrimage, one of the central pillars of Islam. Canceling the hajj would be unprecedented in modern times, but limiting attendance from high-risk areas has happened before, such as during the Ebola outbreak.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Millions of Muslim Pilgrims The hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the most holy city for Muslims. All Muslims are expected to perform this religious duty at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially able. It is one of the five pillars of Islam, or core ritual practices, and considered to be the largest gathering of people in the world, with millions attending every year.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Following the prophet As many as three million pilgrims perform a series of rituals over the course of five or six days. First, they stop to pray at the Grand Mosque, home to a cubic building draped in black silk called the Kaaba, Islam’s most important shrine.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Stoning the devil Pilgrims travel to the village of Mina to again pray and read from the Quran. Next they spend a day at Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed gave his final sermon, to ask for forgiveness. On their return journey to Mecca, the pilgrims stop on a plain called Muzdalifah to collect stones, which they will throw at three pillars in Mina to symbolically stone the devil.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Circling Kaaba Finally, upon returning to Mecca, the pilgrims will circle the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque seven times, bringing their hajj to a close. They then shave their heads and perform an animal sacrifice before celebrating the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Tragedy during hajj Since 1987, more than 5,800 people have died in building collapses, stampedes, trampling and fires. In 2015, a stampede resulted in around 2,400 deaths, making it the worst catastrophe in the history of hajj. The pilgrimage is also a hotbed of infectious disease, as pilgrims from every corner of the planet often trek around in the heat barefoot and share tight sleeping quarters.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Bringing the new to the old While the hajj is the oldest and most sacred ritual of Islam, it has also been brought into the 21st Century. The Saudi government is using the latest in crowd-control techniques to prevent trampling and architectural collapses. On YouTube, they telecast live hajj and now, Google, iTunes and other sites have come out with hajj apps to help pilgrims better understand and perform the hajj rituals.\n\n\n\n06:45 Taiwan has said it will donate 10 million masks to the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe island, which is the world's second-largest mask producer, will send 7 million masks to 11 European countries including Italy, Spain and Germany.\n\nThe United States will receive 2 million masks, Germany's DPA news agency reported, with a further 1 million masks to be sent to the 15 countries with which Taiwan has diplomatic relations.\n\nTaiwan soon expects to be able to make 15 million surgical masks a day.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center said there had been 322 total cases of COVID-19 on the island, including five deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, President Tsai Ing-wen announced a financial stimulus valuing some $35 billion (€31 billion) to cushion the impact of the coronavirus on the Taiwanese economy.\n\nRead more: How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?\n\nWatch video 03:10 Is the virus under control in China and Taiwan? – DW's Phoebe Kong reports\n\n06:23 China's National Health Commission says it has recorded 36 new cases of the COVID-19 disease in one day, after announcing that asymptomatic cases would be included in the official count from now on. It did not say if any of the new cases was asymptomatic.\n\nThe commission said all but one of the new cases was imported from abroad. It also added that there had been seven more deaths from the disease in the past 24 hours.\n\nChina’s National Health Commission has reported 1,367 asymptomatic cases under observation as of Tuesday. The country announced earlier on Wednesday that is was extending screening to asymptomatic cases and the people with whom they have been in contact.\n\nThe data comes amid scrutiny of figures reported by the Chinese authorities, which previously only included those people who exhibited symptoms. The proportion of people who have contracted the virus but remain asymptomatic is currently unknown, but experts have estimated it could be as high as 30%. According to scientists, these carriers can still pass COVID-19 onto others who do become sick.\n\nWhile China's domestic outbreak has largely subsided, questions have arisen over whether the country's failure to count asymptomatic cases would lead to a resurgence of infections.\n\nChina, where the novel coronavirus was first detected in December, has recorded a total of 81,554 cases of COVID-19 and 3,312 deaths from the disease.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: China's Wuhan prepares for the uncertain end of COVID-19\n\n05:47 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the coronavirus pandemic amounted to humanity's worst crisis since World War II, with the outbreak threatening people in every country.\n\nGuterres said the disease and measures taken against it would likely bring about a recession \"that probably has no parallel in the recent past.\"\n\nThe effect of both the disease and its economic impact will contribute to \"enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict,\" the UN chief said at the launch on Tuesday of a report into the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19.\n\n\"We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the United Nations — one that is killing people, spreading human suffering, and upending people's lives,\" the report said.\n\n\"This is much more than a health crisis. It is a human crisis. The coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core.\"\n\nEarlier, Guterres announced a new trust fund that would help some countries respond to the emergency and recover from its effects at a social and economic level.\n\n05:40 German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to meet state premiers from across Germany on Wednesday to discuss the effect that anti-coronavirus measures are having.\n\nGermany introduced strict contact restrictions about 10 days ago, banning meetings between more than two people not from the same household outside of the workplace.\n\nIt is expected that the latest discussions will include a debate over an obligation to wear masks in public places. Austria announced such a measure on Monday, triggering discussions in Germany. Some municipalities in the eastern state of Thuringia have already issued decrees for masks to be mandatory in supermarkets, buses and trains.\n\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn on Tuesday said he was against making it obligatory for protective masks to be worn.\n\nWatch video 01:53 Share Are face masks effective?

This makes it the country with the fifth-highest level of infection in the world, although this has been partly attributed to the widespread testing being carried out in the country. The university data also shows a total of 775 deaths as a result of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), put the death toll in the country at 732 as of early Wednesday and the total number of infection cases at 67,366. The RKI sometimes has a slight time lag in updating its data because it collates figures submitted by regional and local authorities.\n\nThe agency's data showed infections had increased by 5,453 compared with the previous day, while the death toll had experienced a sharp rise of 149.\n\n04:29 The death toll in the US from the novel coronavirus pandemic has reached 4,076 — double the number from three days prior, the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland reported. The total number of infections has reached 189,510 nationwide, according to the same statistics. Experts have predicted that up to 240,000 individuals in the US could die as a result of the outbreak.\n\n03:51 In sharp change from his usual tone on the coronavirus pandemic, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro acknowledged the danger posed by the outbreak. \"The virus is a reality,\" he said in a televised speech on Tuesday. \"We are standing in front of one of the greatest challenges of our generation.\"\n\nPreviously, Bolsonaro dismissed the virus as a \"little flu,\" criticized lockdowns imposed by local authorities, and flaunted social distancing recommendations from his own government by meeting groups of his supporters. He also repeatedly urged Brazilians to return to work.\n\nIn the Tuesday speech, Bolsonaro once again voiced his concerns over the economy and warned that the cure against the outbreak cannot be worse than the pandemic itself.\n\n03:33 Taiwan's government will provide an economic stimulus of over $1 trillion, (€907 billion) to mitigate coronavirus fallout, said President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday.\n\nRead more: How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?\n\n03:27 German police believe anti-pandemic isolation measures are causing a rise in domestic violence. The rise is already noticeable according to the data provided by victims' shelters and emergency phone operators, said senior police representative Harald Schmidt.\n\nSpeaking to Passauer Neue Presse daily, Schmidt said that similar spikes regularly happen during Christmas holidays when families \"spend more time with each other.\" However, the current crisis is also boosting financial fears and other stress factors often linked with abuse, said Schmidt.\n\n03:17 California will release some 3,500 non-violent inmates from prison as part of its efforts to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, state officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe first group will consist of inmates with less than 30 days to serve, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). They would be followed by prisoners with less than 60 days remaining of their term.\n\n\"We do not take these new measures lightly,\" CDCR Secretary Ralph Diaz said in a statement. \"However, in the face of a global pandemic, we must consider the risk of COVID-19 infection as a grave threat to safety, too.\"\n\n03:14 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier joined several heads of state to urge a \"new global alliance\" against the coronavirus in a letter published by the Financial Times on Wednesday.\n\n\"This pandemic will not spare any country, no matter how advanced its economy, capabilities, or technology,\" the leaders said in a letter also signed by Singapore's President Halimah Yacob, Ethiopia's Sahle-Work Zewde, Ecuador's Lenin Moreno, as well as Jordan's King Abdullah II.\n\n\"This is a global crisis,\" the letter states. \"Delay in action means death.\" Among other measures, the heads of state called for boosting research into treatments and vaccines, and \"fair and equitable\" distribution of medical equipment ant testing kits. \"A global solution is in everybody's self-interest,\" they said.\n\n03:00 Germany's Bayreuth Festival, the annual opera event honoring composer Richard Wagner, has been canceled due to the coronavirus.\n\nThe popular music festival had been set to start in late July and last until late August. The event was to feature a premiere of a new production of Wagner's epic four-part Ring Cycle.\n\n\"We are of course sad, especially because we were looking forward to an exciting new production of the 'Ring,'\" said the festival chief and composer's great-granddaughter Katharina Wagner. \"But health comes first,\" she told Germany's DPA news agency.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled All quiet on the Wagnerian front An older audience packed in close quarters in a sweltering theater: for virus transmission, a horrific scenario. The Bayreuth Festival 2020 has been called off, for the first time in its 144-year history due to an epidemic. Rehearsals for the new production of the opera cycle \"The Ring of the Nibelung\" were to begin on April 1 - but now, the \"Ring\" can only premiere in 2022 at the earliest.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Berlin's major events A day after Berlin announced that performances in major state-owned venues were to be cancelled until April 19, city authorities have banned all events with more than 1,000 participants as well. \"The coronavirus continues to spread. In such a phase, public life must be restricted,\" Berlin's local Health Minister Dilek Kalayci said.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Madonna and other concerts Many major concerts have been cancelled, including Madonna's last two dates of her \"Madame X\" tour in Paris. France has banned on Sunday public gatherings of more than 1,000 people. The Paris Opera has also cancelled its performances.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled St. Patrick's Day in Ireland All Irish St. Patrick's Day parades, including Dublin's main celebration that draws around 500,000 revelers from all over the world each year, are cancelled because of fears over the spread of COVID-19, state broadcaster RTE reported on Monday. Ireland's famous March 17 parades were also previously cancelled in 2001 during an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Vatican museums With quarantine measures in place in northern Italy, soccer matches occurring without spectators, and Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte's order to close museums, theaters and cinemas, it should come as no surprise that the Vatican has closed the doors to its museums, including the Sistine Chapel (above), until probably April 3. In the Vatican itself, five people are currently in quarantine.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled South by Southwest (SXSW) This annual music, film and tech festival held in Austin, Texas, usually attracts more than 400,000 visitors. But less than a week before its March 12, 2020 start date, organizers decided to cancel in a bid to prevent the spreading of the coronavirus. There's a silver lining though: it may only be postponed and not cancelled altogether.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Bollywood 'Oscars' The International Film Academy has announced that it would be postponing its awards ceremony, also known as Bollywood's Oscars, due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak. According to official numbers, India has been until now relatively unscathed by the epidemic. Actor Shah Rukh Khan (photo) was one the stars expected at the event planned for March 27; a new date has not been decided yet.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled 'No Time to Die' James Bond perhaps has a little more time on his hands than the title of the upcoming film in the franchise suggests: \"No Time to Die\" producers have decided to push back the release of the movie to November. Daniel Craig's last outing as 007 was initially planned for April. It's the first Hollywood blockbuster to shift its release schedule in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Venice Architecture Biennale The start of the world's most prestigious architecture biennale has also been delayed. Instead of opening in May, it will run from August 29 to November 29 — three months later than planned. The theme of the event takes on a new meaning amid current developments: \"How do we live together?\"\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled London Book Fair Due to take place March 10-12, the book fair was cancelled \"with reluctance,\" said organizers, after several major publishers such as HarperCollins and Penguin Random House pulled out of the event to avoid exposing their staff to the virus. The London Book Fair usually draws more than 25,000 authors and book industry insiders.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Musikmesse Frankfurt Europe's biggest trade fair for the music industry also announced that it was postponing the event, which was set to celebrate its 40th anniversary on April 2-4. While it was deemed to be \"the only responsible and right decision to take,\" the cancellation is bound to affect many small businesses in the music industry, said Christian Höppner, secretary general of the German Music Council.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Leipzig Book Fair Change of plans for book fans: The Leipzig Book Fair, scheduled to be held March 12-15, was cancelled due to the spread of the new coronavirus, a spokesperson for the fair announced on March 3. The second-largest book fair in Germany expected to draw 2,500 exhibitors from 51 countries.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled ITB Travel Trade Show Berlin Preparations for the world's largest travel fair were already in full swing when the organizers cancelled it at the last minute. Due to the ongoing virus threat, participants to the Berlin fair had to prove they had not been to one of the defined risk areas. With 170,000 visitors from all over the world, this proved to be an impossible task and the fair couldn't open on March 4 as planned.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Milan Design Week Each April, thousands of design professionals, artists and companies visit Milan to check out the latest in furniture and interior design. This year, however, organizers have announced it will be moved to June due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Milan is the capital of the Lombardy region, which has seen the lion's share of Italian coronivirus cases. Some airlines have even suspended their flights.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled La Scala opera house There is perhaps no venue more symbolic of Italy's rich operatic tradition than the La Scala opera house in Milan. Now, its seats will remain empty until March 8. Italy's Prime Minister called for the suspension of cultural events and the venue is sticking to the rules. At the time of writing, Italy has more cases of the new coronavirus than any country outside of Asia.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled K-Pop concerts The reigning K-Pop boy band BTS does big business with each concert, but in the wake of the virus in South Korea, the group cancelled four April dates at the Seoul Olympic Stadium, which seats 69,950 people. \"It's impossible to predict the scale of the outbreak,\" said the group's management. On Tuesday, cases in South Korea reached 5,100 with the majority of infections in the city of Daegu.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled 'Mission Impossible' No, we aren't describing the task of containing the new coronavirus, but rather the new movie starring Tom Cruise which was supposed to have a three-week shoot in Venice. The film has been postponed, movie studio Paramount Pictures said Monday. Venice's cultural events have been hard hit by the outbreak. The final two days of lagoon city's annual Carnival festival were also cancelled.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Concerts in Switzerland On February 28, the Swiss government imposed a ban on events of more than 1,000 people until March 15, making it the first European country to do so as a preemptive measure to fight against the spread of the illness. As a result, many concerts and events were called off, including concerts by Carlos Santana (pictured) and Alice Cooper at the 15,000-person Hellenstadion in Zürich.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled The Hamburg Ballet The Hamburg Ballet John Neumeier cancelled guest performances in Macau and Singapore due to the coronavirus outbreak. On the program were \"The Lady of the Camellias,\" which tells the story of a famous Parisian courtesan and \"Nijinsky.\" Whether the tour will take place at another point in time is still in the air. In spring 2021 the Hamburg Ballet plans to tour in Japan.

Out of the 3,500 civilian servicemen, 2,000 are volunteers who previously completed their mandatory stints, and 1,500 are active servicemen who decided to stay in the system for longer due to the pandemic.\n\nThe men would mostly focus on supporting caregivers with transport, organization and logistics, said Agriculture, Regions and Tourism Minister Elisabeth Köstinger.\n\n\"Currently, this is peace before the storm,\" said Köstinger, whose ministry is also in charge of the civilian service. \"Our care-providing system will very quickly be put under extreme strain, so we need all the support we can get.\"\n\n02:11 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and premiers of Germany's 16 states are set to hold a telephone conference on Wednesday to discuss the battle against the ongoing pandemic. The leaders would discuss prolonging lockdown measures introduced on Monday last week.

The retail giant claims the employee, previously working in a warehouse on New York's Staten Island, was fired because he violated quarantine rules and endangered his colleagues.\n\nOn Tuesday, New York's Attorney General slammed the sacking as \"immoral and inhumane.\"\n\n\"It is disgraceful that Amazon would terminate an employee who bravely stood up to protect himself and his colleagues,\" she said in a statement, adding that her office was \"considering all legal options.\" Separately, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he had ordered the city's human rights officer to look into the incident.\n\n01:02 In the United States, 865 people died of the coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, a record day-to-day increase based on the tally provided by the Johns Hopkins University.

Sailors do not need to die,\" Captain Brett Crozier wrote in a letter to the navy dated on Monday. Crozier asked for over 4,000 people on board to be removed and isolated, warning that most of the current accommodation on board was not suitable for quarantine.\n\nKeeping them on board \"is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those sailors entrusted to our care,\" he wrote. US officials cited by the Reuters news agency said that nearly 80 people aboard the nuclear-powered warship had tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he had not read the letter in detail, but added it was not the time to evacuate the ship. \"I don't think we're at that point,\" he told CNN.\n\n00:30 US President Donald Trump hinted at expanding travel restrictions on Tuesday, saying that he was \"absolutely\" considering a ban on Brazil and several other countries.\n\nIn February and March, the US administration introduced bans on travelers from China and virtually all western European countries in a bid to curb the spread COVID-19.

            "content": "Heavy Rotation: 11 Songs Public Radio Can't Stop Playing\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Karo Cantú/Courtesy of the artist Karo Cantú/Courtesy of the artist\n\nEvery month, we ask radio stations around the country one critical question: What's the one song you can't stop listening to? March's lineup brings you a comeback track from The Strokes, a jazz-tinged rendition of \"Jolene,\" a new tune from the ever-innovative Thundercat and more.\n\nAll songs from this month's Heavy Rotation are available to stream on Apple Music and the Spotify playlist at the bottom of this page.\n\nChildish Gambino, \"19.10\"\n\nActor, filmmaker, writer and musician Donald Glover's fourth Childish Gambino record, 3.15.20, is a challenging, genre-defying and rewarding depth probe. It's a dense album, sonically and conceptually, as songs shape-shift with experiments in sounds and textures while addressing topics like self-love, climate change, parenting and injustice. Part Prince, part Earth, Wind & Fire,\"19.10\" might be the most straight-ahead song, but don't let the funk workout fool you: It's not a party jam, but a father sharing wisdom with his son, preparing him for the harsh realities in life that lay ahead. —Kevin Cole, KEXP\n\nYouTube\n\nEOB, \"Shangri-La\"\n\n\"Shangri-La\" from Ed O'Brien, who performs under the name EOB, was inspired by the Brazilian festival Carnaval, but the beginning of the music on his new album, Earth, was far simpler. O'Brien gave his Radiohead bandmates of 35 years notice that he needed time away to have an extraordinary experience with his family. They moved to rural Brazil on the edge of the rainforest with no cell phones and no internet — just family, music and food. That's where O'Brien began writing on his acoustic guitar. Earth is a celebration of the important things in life. It comes at exactly the right time. —Jon Hart, The Bridge\n\nYouTube\n\nHamilton Leithauser, \"Here They Come\"\n\nInspired by his friend's tendency to shelter in place before it was considered cool or even mandated, \"Here They Come\" is Hamilton Leithauser's way of checking in via song. His new album, The Loves Of Your Life, out April 10, is comprised of songs inspired by a cast of individuals in his life, including several who make cameos in new promo and music videos: Maggie Rogers in a promo for \"Isabella,\" and \"Don't Check The Score\" with Sienna Miller. But it's actor Ethan Hawke who provides the slapstick relief in \"Here They Come\" as Leithauser's impatient friend; his volatile reaction to the song explodes into a kerfuffle at the Café Carlyle. —Gini Mascorro, KXT\n\nYouTube\n\nMy Sister, My Brother, \"Nothing Without You\"\n\nLet's take a minute in this new normal to celebrate the beauty of the human voice lifted up in harmony. These three talented and accomplished artists make magic. When the tornadoes blew through Nashville in early March, we had My Sister, My Brother booked for WMOT's now-suspended lunchtime Friday event. Peter Groenwald, Sean McConnell and Garrison Starr performed \"Nothing Without You,\" and not only were our eyes welling up, but the band teared up on stage as well. The song is from the group's self-titled EP; it is a prayer, a promise, and a song for this extraordinary moment. —Jessie Scott, WMOT\n\nYouTube\n\nNeon Indian, \"Toyota Man\"\n\nGlo-fi. Chillwave. Hypnagogic pop. Oddball genre labels aside, Neon Indian's Alan Palomo has an incredible knack for providing funky and upbeat electronic sounds perfect for any siesta or daytime disco. Palomo has continued to push Neon Indian's style with psychedelic effects and production, while not overcomplicating time-tested electronic music formulas (something Palomo had fully committed to with his solo project, VEGA, before merging with the live band). Late last year, Neon Indian released its first single in four years, putting Palomo's Mexican American multiculturalism and politically-charged humor front and center, something we hope to hear more of in the near future. —Jack Anderson, KUTX\n\nYouTube\n\nPretenders, \"The Buzz\"\n\nLast December, when Pretenders lead singer and guitarist Chrissie Hynde did an interview with World Cafe host Raina Douris about Hynde's solo record, Valve Bone Woe, she told Douris that a new Pretenders album was done, and it would be out sometime in May of this year. That promise has been fulfilled with the arrival of \"The Buzz,\" the first new song from Hate For Sale, out May 1. The song, about a love affair and the addictive feeling you get when it hits, \"The Buzz\" is an instant classic Pretenders song, with Hynde's commanding voice right up front amidst a sea of soaring guitars. —Bruce Warren, WXPN\n\nYouTube\n\nSara Gazarek, \"Jolene\"\n\nMost people wouldn't lump jazz and country together, but that didn't stop Sara Gazarek. A musician without borders, Sara can take music from any genre and make it stunningly her own, including Dolly Parton's \"Jolene.\" The urgency of the piano and drum ostinato create the perfect tension for Sara to break through and beg Jolene not to \"take her man.\" This emotional tension is present throughout her self-produced, Grammy-nominated album Thirsty Ghost. Listening to Thirsty Ghost is like reading a good book: You can't stop until you've heard every single song. —Stephanie Steele, KBYI\n\nYouTube\n\nThe Strokes, \"Bad Decisions\"\n\nThe influence of Billy Idol's \"Dancing With Myself\" is heard throughout the upbeat new single from The Strokes. Upon the guitar intro of \"Bad Decisions,\" there are rhythmically similar notes that shine through this thrilling '80s-inspired song that will appear on their first new album in seven years, the aptly titled The New Abnormal. Blending in the band's trademark garage rock sound, this fun comeback track is reminiscent of what has always made it great — exciting guitars, drums and catchy hooks. Not to worry: Idol received a songwriting credit. —Alisha Sweeney, Colorado Public Radio\n\nYouTube\n\nThundercat (feat. Ty Dolla $ign & Lil B), \"Fair Chance\"\n\nHere in the Mountain Stage office, we've long shared a mutual love for the unmatched innovator Thundercat. We were understandably excited when a press release for his latest single, \"Fair Chance,\" arrived in our inbox, and instead of cranking the tune in our office, quarantine efforts meant we had to reply-all with our thoughts.\n\n\"Thundercat is the hero we need right now,\" was my first thought. Associate Producer Vasilia Scouras said there was a toddler dance party in the living room while she listened. Our Assistant Producer John Inghram, himself a bassist and unabashed Thundercat fan, took a break from home-schooling his two boys to summarize, astutely, that \"it's like Stanley Clarke and Jaco Pastorius had a love child, then let Sailor Moon and Michael Jackson raise it in the streets of LA. With tutoring by Basquiat. Big fan.\"\n\nSo, when It Is What It Is drops on April 3, the Mountain Stage team will no doubt still be socially distant; but hopefully enjoying the music together, even though we're apart, will help make that distance seem a little closer. —Adam Harris, West Virginia Public Broadcasting\n\nYouTube\n\nWaxahatchee, \"Lilacs\"\n\nOn her new album Saint Cloud, songwriter Katie Crutchfield of Waxahatchee has largely abandoned the '90s-inspired soft/loud guitar rock that defined much of her band's recent work. \"Lilacs\" sounds more like Lucinda Williams than Pixies, with the Alabama-born singer proudly leaning into her Southern drawl and showcasing her confident lyric writing. \"And the lilacs drank the water, and the lilacs die / And the lilacs drank the water, marking the slow, slow / Slow passing of time,\" she sings here, hopefully serving as a reminder to all of us that even in these scary and turbulent times, beautiful constants remain. —Jerad Walker, opbmusic\n\nYouTube\n\nWu Fei and Abigail Washburn, \"Four Seasons\"\n\nNashville's Abigail Washburn and Beijing's Wu Fei are perfectly matched in their interpretation of this Chinese folk song. The clawhammer banjo and guzheng may seem odd bedfellows, but their percussive zeal here provides an almost cinematic accompaniment to a song about the excitement of new love. The singers trade lines in English and Chinese, galloping through the narrative like a pair of young girls riding bareback toward their beaus. Washburn and Wu have been collaborating for years onstage across both the US and China, but this is their first duo recording, and it's well worth the wait. —Kim Ruehl, Folk Alley\n\nYouTube\n\nStream Heavy Rotation on Spotify and Apple Music, updated monthly."

            "content": "LONDON — The world is almost certainly ensnared in a devastating recession delivered by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNow, fears are growing that the downturn could be far more punishing and long lasting than initially feared — potentially enduring into next year, and even beyond — as governments intensify restrictions on business to halt the spread of the pandemic, and as fear of the virus reconfigures the very concept of public space, impeding consumer-led economic growth.\n\nThe pandemic is above all a public health emergency. So long as human interaction remains dangerous, business cannot responsibly return to normal. And what was normal before may not be anymore. People may be less inclined to jam into crowded restaurants and concert halls even after the virus is contained.\n\nThe abrupt halt of commercial activity threatens to impose economic pain so profound and enduring in every region of the world at once that recovery could take years. The losses to companies, many already saturated with debt, risk triggering a financial crisis of cataclysmic proportions.\n\n“I feel like the 2008 financial crisis was just a dry run for this,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of a history of financial crises, “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.”\n\n“This is already shaping up as the deepest dive on record for the global economy for over 100 years,” he said. “Everything depends on how long it lasts, but if this goes on for a long time, it’s certainly going to be the mother of all financial crises.”\n\nThe situation looks uniquely dire in developing countries, which have seen investment rush for the exits this year, sending currencies plummeting, forcing people to pay more for imported food and fuel, and threatening governments with insolvency — all of this while the pandemic itself threatens to overwhelm inadequate medical systems.\n\nAmong investors, a hopeful scenario holds currency: The recession will be painful but short-lived, giving way to a robust recovery this year. The global economy is in a temporary deep freeze, the logic goes. Once the virus is contained, enabling people to return to offices and shopping malls, life will snap back to normal. Jets will fill with families going on merely deferred vacations. Factories will resume, fulfilling saved up orders.\n\nBut even after the virus is tamed — and no one really knows when that will be — the world that emerges is likely to be choked with trouble, challenging the recovery. Mass joblessness exacts societal costs. Widespread bankruptcy could leave industry in a weakened state, depleted of investment and innovation.\n\nHouseholds may remain agitated and risk averse, making them prone to thrift. Some social distancing measures could remain indefinitely. Consumer spending amounts to roughly two-thirds of economic activity worldwide. If anxiety endures and people are reluctant to spend, expansion will be limited — especially as continued vigilance against the coronavirus may be required for years.\n\n“The psychology won’t just bounce back,” said Charles Dumas, chief economist at TS Lombard, an investment research firm in London. “People have had a real shock. The recovery will be slow, and certain behavior patterns are going to change, if not forever at least for a long while.”\n\nRising stock prices in the United States have in recent years propelled spending. Millions of people are now filing claims for unemployment benefits, while wealthier households are absorbing the reality of substantially diminished retirement savings.\n\nAmericans boosted their rates of savings significantly in the years after the Great Depression. Fear and tarnished credit limited reliance on borrowing. That could happen again.\n\n“The loss of income on the labor front is tremendous,” Dumas said. “The loss of value in the wealth effect is also very strong.”\n\nThe sense of alarm is enhanced by the fact that every inhabited part of the globe is now in trouble.\n\nThe United States, the world’s largest economy, is almost certainly in a recession. So is Europe. So probably are significant economies like Canada, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. China, the world’s second-largest economy, is expected to grow by only 2% this year, according to TS Lombard, the research firm."

In 2019, emissions are estimated to have set a new all-time high of 36.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nOfficials said the UN gathering is likely to be rescheduled for the middle of 2021, although no date has been set.\n\nWashington Post\n\nIran says US sanctions are taking lives; US disagrees\n\nAs Iran struggles with a devastating coronavirus outbreak, a broken economy, and a severe shortage of medical equipment, it says that US trade sanctions are taking Iranian lives and has called for the United States to lift them on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIran’s plea is gaining traction around the globe, winning support from allies like Russia and China, but also the European Union, the United Nations secretary-general, rights groups, and nearly three dozen members of Congress, who have appealed to the Trump administration to suspend the sanctions.\n\nIran, a global epicenter of the virus, has confirmed more than 47,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths, although public health specialists estimate the real toll to be several times higher.\n\nIn a sign of desperation, Iran requested a $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, the first time it has applied for such a loan since the 1960s. The European Union has said it would support the loan, but the United States is expected to block it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York Times\n\nWhat’s known, not known about China’s virus numbers\n\nBEIJING — Every few days brings another grim milestone in the outbreak. First Italy and Spain surpassed China in reported deaths. Then, this week, the United States and France did.\n\nBut did they really?\n\nSkepticism about China’s numbers has swirled throughout the crisis, fueled by official efforts to quash bad news in the early days and a general distrust of the government. Long lines of people waiting to collect the ashes of loved ones at funeral homes last week revived the debate.\n\nThere is no smoking gun pointing to a coverup by China’s ruling Communist Party. But intentional or not, there is reason to believe that more people died of COVID-19 than the official tally, which stood at 3,312 at the end of Tuesday. The same applies to the 81,554 confirmed cases.\n\n“The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 by country appears like a grim league table and draws the attention of many,’’ said Hsu Li Yang, who heads the infectious diseases program at the National University of Singapore. “However, it is important to understand that these numbers – be it from China, Italy, Singapore, or the USA – are all inaccurate, and they are all underestimates to varying degrees of the actual number of infections.’’\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSaudi Arabia asks Muslims to put hajj plans on hold\n\nSaudi Arabia asked Muslims to put on hold plans to perform the obligatory annual hajj pilgrimage this year as the kingdom grapples with the coronavirus.\n\n‘‘We have asked our Muslim brothers around the world to wait’’ on making hajj plans ‘‘until there is clarity,’’ Mohammad Benten, the minister of hajj and umrah, told state-run Al Ekhbariya TV.\n\nSaudi Arabia reported 110 cases of the virus on Tuesday, bringing the total to 1,563, including 10 deaths. Halting the hajj, which attracts millions of pilgrims to Islam’s birthplace, would be unprecedented in recent history. The kingdom suspended the lesser, non-obligatory umrah pilgrimage last month.\n\nThe country has put the holy cities of Mecca and Medina on lockdown. The hajj is due begin in late July.\n\nBloomberg News\n\nWeather forecasts are at risk from COVID-19 lockdowns\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brought global commerce to a near standstill. Now it’s threatening to obscure the ability to even make forecasts based on weather data.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization said it’s concerned about the virus’s impact on the quality and quantity of weather observations and forecasts. Maintenance on satellite systems and weather stations could be affected if lockdowns continue in the coming weeks.\n\nAccurate weather predictions are critical for commodities markets including agriculture, natural gas, electricity, and coal. Farmers and food-crop traders rely on forecasts for planting schedules and prices. Gas markets are particularly sensitive to weather data to help predict demand.\n\nThe amount of weather-related information collected from commercial aircraft has already plummeted as airlines across the globe ground flights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Geneva-based organization is monitoring the situation and is working with member states to mitigate the impact, it said.\n\nBloomberg News\n\nEdinburgh’s summer fests canceled for the first time\n\nLONDON — Every August, the Scottish capital of Edinburgh plays host to some of the funniest and most talented — not to forget strangest — performers from the UK and the wider world. Not this year. Organizers canceled the city’s collection of late summer festivals Wednesday.\n\nThe decision marks the first cancellation since the Edinburgh International Festival launched in 1947 in the aftermath of World War II as an attempt to reconcile people and nations through the performing arts.\n\nNow numbering five, including the wildly popular Fringe lineup of both obscure and mainstream acts, Edinburgh’s annual August festivals draw 4.4 million people to more than 5,000 events involving over 25,000 artists, writers, and performers from 70 countries, according to organizers.\n\nCollectively, the festivals are billed as the second-biggest cultural event in the world after the Olympic Games, which were set to take place in Tokyo before the pandemic forced a postponement last week.\n\nAssociated Press\n\nBolsonaro, isolated and defiant, dismisses threat to Brazil\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO — As cases and deaths mount in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has remained defiant, the last notable holdout among major world leaders in denying the severity of the coronavirus.\n\nBrazilians, he declared last week, are uniquely suited to weather the pandemic because they can be dunked in raw sewage and “don’t catch a thing.”\n\nDefying guidelines issued by his own health ministry, the president on Sunday visited a busy commercial district in Brasília, the capital, where he called on all but elderly Brazilians to get back to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he insisted that an antimalaria pill of unproved efficacy would cure those who fall ill.\n\n“God is Brazilian,” he told a throng of supporters. “The cure is right there.”\n\nSeveral world leaders — among them President Trump — were slow to grasp the menace of the highly contagious virus, and reluctant to embrace disruptive and economically painful social distancing measures that have become the norm in much of the world.\n\nBut Bolsonaro remains the highest profile holdout in eschewing the scientific consensus on the lockdown measures required to keep health care systems from being overwhelmed.\n\nNew York Times"

            "content": "Literary agents at 2 Seas Agency say that, thanks to digital communication, publishers working from home are actively reading submissions and making offers.\n\nBy Porter Anderson, Editor-in-Chief | @Porter_Anderson\n\nIn Rights Trading, No ‘LBF Effect’ This Year\n\nO\n\nseries of stories on how world publishing’s people are responding to the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic can be expected, in many if not most cases, to outline significant adjustments in how workers are carrying on, as best as possible, with their business.\n\nIn the case of the 2 Seas Agency, however, operating in the foreign rights trade at a distance—both inside and outside the company—isn’t that far from the norm. The company sells both worldwide rights and into specific territories, of course, and was established in Ojai, California, in 2011.\n\nMany international publishing players know the company’s co-owner and lead agent Marleen Seegers, who’s based in Ojai, and tends to rack up as many airline miles as any of us in a given year of trade shows and rights fair travel.\n\nAs it turns out, though, the company’s senior agent Chrysothemis (Chrys) Armefti has found that the onset of the pandemic requires her to move no farther than the kitchen to the living room—on Cyprus, where she and her husband now are working from home. Armefti is based in Nicosia, near the center of the island.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center at this writing shows Cyprus’ population of 1.1 million people to have confirmed 262 coronavirus cases and eight deaths—by world standards, an enviably low viral presence being registered so far.\n\nWe start our exchange with Armefti, by asking her how things normally operate for the company.\n\n‘The Virtual Structure’\n\nChrys Armefti: 2 Seas Agency sells rights on behalf of publishers, agents, and a select number of authors from around the world. Ojai, where we’re headquartered, is a small town just south of Santa Barbara, and quite the opposite of a publishing hub. It soon became evident it was going to be challenging to find staff locally with the right profile and experience to support the agency’s growth.\n\n“Despite the worries, people seem to have more time to effectively read the books we’re sending out on submission.” Chrys Armefti, 2 Seas Agency\n\nIn late 2012, Marleen started working with a virtual staff, and the agency has had a completely virtual structure ever since. I joined 2 Seas in the summer of 2015 while I was living in Portugal, and now I work from Cyprus.\n\nWorking from home became the new norm for me right away, and being able to access the company’s online tools and database from anywhere in the world gives me absolute freedom. The virtual structure also enables us to conduct business as usual during our travels to book fairs and other international publishing events.\n\nDespite the 10-hour difference between Cyprus and California, we always find time to connect in the late afternoon or evening, my time. Communicating with someone who’s not physically in the same place can be challenging, especially if you heavily rely on email. We use Skype or WhatsApp video calls for longer conversations between the two of us at least once a week, but for smaller exchanges, suggestions, and so forth, Google Docs have become our go-to tool.\n\nWe’ve noticed it’s important to stay away from email for such internal communication, otherwise you run the risk of your inbox becoming your to-do list.\n\nPublishing Perspectives: What’s the situation now with the pandemic spreading?\n\nCA: In Cyprus, we’ve been in confinement since March 13. My husband works for an international videogame company and they sent everyone home on the same day that schools were closed because of COVID-19.\n\nI let go of my sunny kitchen table and moved to a smaller table in the living room. Working in the same space as a couple has its advantages and disadvantages. While now I have company and don’t eat lunch by myself, we both have to be respectful of each other’s work, especially when we’re on calls with our colleagues or clients. In case my husband and I have calls at the same time, we alternate whoever is going to have the meeting in the bedroom.\n\nThanks to the agency’s virtual set-up [Seegers has written about this here] we were very fortunate not to have a transition to the virus-era mode at all. As for the other team members, besides Marleen in California, we currently have two other colleagues who work from different places in the United States Over the years, we’ve had people on our team based in Brazil, France, Greece, the UK, and Italy.\n\n‘To Mitigate the Impact’\n\nPP: What are the key challenges in working this way?\n\nCA: Being at home for days on end is not ideal. The moments that we had outdoors during the day and our social gatherings on the weekend are now nonexistent. I live in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, and its only green place for exercising is already crowded.\n\n“Without having had an ‘LBF-effect’ on our sales—which none of us rights sellers seem to have had—we continue to receive and negotiate offers.” Chrys Armefti, 2 Seas Agency\n\nWe try to exercise half an hour before starting work in the morning just to keep a bit active. Family and friends now have more time for us but we need to set boundaries—such as, “working from home” doesn’t mean “I don’t work at all.”\n\nOur days are now more organized, both on a personal and a professional level, because we need to stay sharp until the end of the lockdown. We try to keep things as before, though. Batch cooking helps to free up time, but it doesn’t mean that just because we’re both at home now that we have infinite time for food preparation.\n\nPP: Are there any happy surprises in how this is working?\n\nCA: Working from home is probably challenging for those who are doing it for the first time or who have kids to homeschool. But for us it’s less an adjustment.\n\nThe challenge for me now is mainly to share my home office with someone else. I also had to become more flexible about respecting the schedules of those we’re in touch with from all over the world—acquiring editors, scouts, co-agents, all of whom have had to change their own work structures and adapt to working from home in less than a week, often while schooling their kids.\n\nPP: Speaking of being in touch, how are your communications going?\n\nCA: I would say our communication by phone and email have in fact increased compared to before the start of the pandemic.\n\n“Publishers are still looking for books to publish in one or two years’ time.” Chrys Armefti, 2 Seas Agency\n\nWe had many face-to-face meetings scheduled this book fair season. Marleen had to cut her five-week European trip short earlier this month to return to California after having finished just one week of meetings in Amsterdam. We were both supposed to attend London Book Fair the following week, and Marleen was then to continue with visits to Paris and Milan. The Prague Book Fair that I was planning to attend in May has also been postponed to October 2020.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business, we’ve been conducting phone, WhatsApp, Skype and other kinds of conference calls to replace as many of these personal meetings as possible. If calls aren’t a possibility, we’ve managed to communicate efficiently by email and we’ve been fortunate enough not to run into many technical hurdles.\n\nPP: And how is everyone doing in terms of mood and outlook?\n\nCA: The coronavirus pandemic is definitely the initial topic of our conversations. We’re all in the same boat, and sharing our fears and anxieties—besides tips on how to better work from home—with people from around the world creates an even tighter bond with everyone. There’s a real sense of solidarity and connection, which is heart-warming in these times of isolation and social distancing.\n\nDespite the worries, people seem to have more time to effectively read the books we’re sending out on submission. Without having had an “LBF-effect” on our sales—which none of us rights sellers seem to have had—we continue to receive and negotiate offers. Publishers are still looking for books to publish in one or two years’ time.\n\nAnd when someone turns a title down, their message is more often accompanied by an explanation about why they didn’t think this book was going to work for them. This allows us to better prepare our submissions for this person next time, while we can also communicate the explanations to our clients and authors who appreciate it.\n\nIf You’d Like To Alert Us to Your Plans and Updates\n\nWe’re receiving good notice from many associates in the world industry, and we’d be glad to consider having you join them in telling us about your coronavirus-related news for our international readership. Please note that we don’t use articles written by industry professionals, but if you’d like us to consider doing an interview with you, contact Porter@PublishingPerspectives.com.\n\nThe world totals at this writing are 887,067 cases, 44,264 deaths.\n\nFor a comparison, when we published our “Coronavirus Worklife” piece with Lena Stjernström at Stockholm’s Grand Agency, those world totals were 487,684 cases and 22,030 deaths.\n\nThat was just six days ago, on March 26.\n\nMore from Publishing Perspectives on international rights trading is here, and more on the coronavirus outbreak is here.\n\nIn our Spring 2020 Magazine, Publishing Perspectives has interviewed publishers, industry experts, entrepreneurs, and authors to present a look at the book business for the coming year.

This is lower than was previously thought.\n\nOther coronavirus developments\n\nThe European Central Bank has launched an emergency €750 billion package to ease the economic impact of the pandemic, and the Bank of England cut the base interest rate from 0.25% to 0.1%, a record low.\n\nMore travel restrictions have been put into place around the world to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Australia and New Zealand have completely closed their borders to foreigners and, in the UK, up to 40 London Underground stations are to be shut.\n\nOn-going lockdowns in France and Italy may be extended into April. India’s population of 1.3 billion have been asked to observe a curfew on Sunday to test the country’s ability to respond to the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\n\nAt a press briefing, Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said it is now highly improbable that the virus can be made to “go away”. Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, said it was not possible to put a timeline on when the country will be able to relax its measures for controlling the virus.\n\nIn the world of sports, there is still no sign of the Tokyo Olympics being postponed or cancelled, but all English football will be suspended until at least 30 April.\n\nCoronavirus cases\n\nThe worldwide death toll has passed 9000. The number of confirmed cases is more than 220,000, according to the map and dashboard from Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\n\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\n\nUnderstanding the virus: Scientists are working around the clock to understand the biology of the covid-19 virus and how it infects human cells, which will help us design treatments to stop it.\n\nComment: UK politicians are invoking science to defend their policies but even the ‘best science’ doesn’t have the final word on covid-19.\n\nCoronavirus origin: No, the covid-19 virus is not a bioweapon and it was not made in a lab.\n\nWho is the WHO: Find out more about the organisation guiding global responses to the pandemic.\n\nSpanish policemen control the border crossing between Spain and France GUILLAUME HORCAJUELO/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n18 March\n\nTravel bans come into effect around the world\n\nGermany joined France, Spain and Italy in closing schools, closing non-essential shops and urging its citizens to stay at home as much as possible. As the EU’s new 30-day travel ban came into effect today, thousands of passengers were stopped at Germany’s largest airport, Frankfurt Am Main. Traffic was backed up for more than 60 kilometres on the motorway at the German-Polish border as Poland introduced border controls. The FT reports that London could be “locked down” imminently with similarly strict rules on being outdoors to that seen in Spain and Italy.\n\n\n\nSeveral countries in Africa have also announced travel bans, including Nigeria, and, in South America, Brazil has closed its border to Venezuela. The US-Canada border will also close temporarily.\n\nGovernments around the world, including in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, Norway and the United Arab Emirates, are now urging their citizens to return home as the coronavirus spreads.\n\nOther coronavirus developments\n\nThe UK has announced that it is closing schools from Friday, except for the children of key workers in the NHS, police and supermarkets. Schools will be asked to make provisions for the children of these key workers and to look after the most vulnerable children. Exams have also been cancelled for the year.\n\nThe Trump administration has outlined a $1 trillion package to support the US economy. This follows the UK government announcement of a £330 billion stimulus package yesterday. Despite this, share prices in Europe, the US and Asia continue to fall.\n\nSeveral foreign countries have cancelled or postponed their national team training camps for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games which are still scheduled to take place in July. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) told the BBC they are committed to finding a solution with the least negative impact for the athletes, while protecting the integrity of the competition and the athletes’ health.\n\nA drug used in Japan to treat new strains of influenza appears to be effective at treating the coronavirus, but it doesn’t appear to be effective in more severe cases, medical authorities in China have said.\n\n\n\nFollowing confusion over the use of ibuprofen by people with suspected or confirmed covid-19, the UK’s National Health Service has now advised people to take paracetamol to treat coronavirus symptoms, unless their doctor has told them otherwise. In a statement, they said “there is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (covid-19) worse.”\n\nNeil Ferguson, the Imperial College London scientist who led research that is reported to have influenced changes to the UK’s coronavirus policy, has developed covid-19 symptoms and is self isolating.\n\nCoronavirus cases\n\nThe worldwide death toll has passed 8000. The number of confirmed cases is now over 200,000, according to the map and dashboard from Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\n\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\n\nCoronavirus vaccine: Researchers are racing to develop a vaccine against covid-19 within 12 to 18 months. This will mean relying on untested techniques – and that comes with its own risks.\n\n\n\nTravel restrictions: Australia has announced major restrictions on overseas travel, large gatherings, and visits to aged care homes in an effort to limit the spread of covid-19. The country is still in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA quiet Regent Street in London. Rick Findler/PA Wire/PA Images\n\n17 March\n\nWHO on how countries can beat coronavirus\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said today a combination of actions by governments including more testing and contact tracing could save lives. “The experience of China and others shows testing and contact tracing, combined with social distancing measures and community mobilisation, when put in place quickly and effectively, can prevent infections and can save lives,” said Hans Kluge at the WHO, during an update on the situation in Europe.\n\nHe said the virus could be beaten back by solidarity within communities and between countries. “These are unprecedented times. It is important that countries work together, learn from each other and harmonise the efforts.” Asked by New Scientist about the new measures announced by the UK yesterday, he said he applauded them. “We are pleased to see the UK is getting into the mainstream and stepping up its efforts.”\n\nUK health service under pressure\n\nThe UK’s chief scientific advisor Patrick Vallance said today there were probably around 55,000 cases in the country, as official cases jumped to 1950, up 407 on yesterday. By comparison to the roughly 8000 annual deaths from the flu he said it would be a “good outcome” if the UK’s new measures kept coronavirus deaths to below 20,000.\n\n“But I mean it is still horrible; that’s still an enormous number of deaths and an enormous pressure on the health service,” Vallance told MPs on the health and social care committee. Asked why schools had not closed yet as they have in other countries, he said it did not have as much impact as other measures at slowing the virus’s spread, and it had “complicating effects”, including children mixing with grandparents, and the impact on the National Health Service workforce. But he said: “It’s absolutely still on the table.”\n\nThe chief executive of the NHS, Simon Stevens, said in response to the crisis the health service was freeing up 30,000 of 100,000 acute care beds for coronavirus patients. He also announced the NHS was stopping all non-urgent surgery from 15 April for three months. Stevens added the UK had access to more than 8000 ventilators for intensive care now, and would soon have around 12,000. But he would not be drawn on whether that would be enough to cope with the peak of the epidemic.\n\nOther coronavirus developments\n\nA strict travel lockdown came into force in France at midday, requiring anyone leaving their home to sign a document declaring that they are doing so for a permitted purpose, including exercise or buying food.\n\nHuman volunteers have been injected with an experimental covid-19 vaccine for the first time as a clinical trial in Seattle gets under way, and the first commercial tests for the virus have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, which should greatly increase testing capacity.\n\nAmazon says it will hire an extra 100,000 workers to respond to a surge in demand for online services.\n\nFrance’s health ministry has suggested that popular anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen could worsen the effects of the coronavirus. Experts say more evidence is needed.\n\nThe UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, has promised £330 billion worth of government-backed loans and guarantees and additional measures to support businesses and households including small cash grants and mortgage holidays. The Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the UK government must act like a war-time government.\n\nCoronavirus cases\n\nThe worldwide death toll has passed 7500. Keep up with the best data on the global cases with this map and dashboard from Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\n\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\n\nAnalysis suggests UK still not doing enough: The UK is introducing stronger measures to tackle the spread of the coronavirus, but some of the science that helped inform this approach suggests it still won’t be enough to avoid a large number of deaths.\n\nSocial distancing: Governments around the world are responding to the covid-19 pandemic and social distancing is a central aspect of plans to limit the spread of the coronavirus. But what is social distancing and how do you do it?\n\nGerman Federal police officers stand at the closed border to France due the Coronovirus Epidemic in Kehl, German RONALD WITTEK/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n16 March\n\nThe UK government has announced that everyone in the country should avoid “non-essential” travel and should voluntarily avoid pubs, clubs and theatres.\n\nGovernments around the world continued to limit travel and close borders. In Europe, Germany partially closed its borders with five countries. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proposed that there should be a ban on all non-essential travel from outside the European Union for 30 days with exemptions for long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats.\n\nSouth Africa and Kenya have imposed strict bans on travel from the worst affected countries.\n\nIn the US, flight bans that were extended to the UK and Ireland came into effect. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut forced the closure of restaurants, bars and cinemas. Australia’s prime minister said all travellers arriving in the country would have to self-isolate for 14 days, or risk prison and fines.\n\nIn Italy, Lombardy’s governor says the growth of new cases has slowed slightly, but cases in Italy and Spain are still increasing much more rapidly than they did in China, as this (log scale) chart from the Financial Times shows.\n\nCoronavirus cases\n\nThe worldwide death toll has passed 6500. Keep up with the best data on the global cases with this map and dashboard from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\n\nTesting is key: The WHO’s assistant director general Bruce Aylward tells New Scientist that effective quarantine is essential for tackling the coronavirus, but this cannot happen without extensive testing for covid-19. Read our full interview with Bruce Aylward.\n\nPregnancy and babies: According to initial reports based on small numbers of people, pregnant women and their babies do not seem to be more vulnerable to covid-19 than other groups of people, but doctors warn that it is too early to know for sure. Early reports suggest the virus doesn’t pass from mother to baby via breast milk, but health bodies are advising new mothers who are infected with the virus to take precautions while breastfeeding, such as washing their hands and wearing a facemask.\n\nPsychological responses: When facing uncertainty, we are motivated to take actions that increase our sense of control over the situation, explains psychologist Rachel McCloy. Unfortunately, this can lead to behaviours such as panic buying, which do not actually help to control the virus and may make the situation worse."

Trump warned US citizens that the next couple of weeks are going to be \"horrific,\" as the country grapples with the outbreak amid predictions of up to 200,000 deaths.\n\nAbout ventilators, the US will soon have an excess, which it will be distributing to other countries, the president said during his daily briefing. Trump also confirmed the construction of two new hospital ships to help ease the burden on the country's overwhelmed medical system.\n\nIn addition, the US \"will work with the world's largest oil producers to address volatility in global oil markets,\" National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said.\n\nThe Trump administration concluded the news conference by highlighting Iran's refusal to accept the US' offer of help.

The problem is bound to be exacerbated as more and more governments require their citizens to wear such masks in public. State and private entities are scrambling to ramp up production to meet the sudden demand.\n\n18:10 More evidence has come out showing that coronavirus infections are being spread by people who do not display obvious symptoms, adding complications to efforts to bring the outbreak under control.\n\nAround 10% of new infections may be caused by people who have the infection but do not experience systems, a study conducted by researchers in Singapore and published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday suggests.\n\nRead more: Up to 30% of coronavirus cases asymptomatic\n\nThe revelations caused the CDC to change its guidance to say that anyone may be considered a coronavirus carrier, regardless of whether they display symptoms.\n\nAn earlier study in China's Hubei province, where the respiratory disease originated, suggested that over 10% of infections may have occurred before people displayed symptoms.\n\nResearchers are also looking into the possibility that infections can also be spread by people who have the illness, recovered, but are still contagious.\n\n16:39 The US state of New York has reported a total of 1,941 coronavirus deaths, up from 1,550 the day before.

Von Notz emphasized that the app would only save the contact data of others who have the app.\n\n\"That, if done correctly in a detailed way, is a data-efficient solution and an effective way of finding out who might have been potentially infected,\" von Notz said.\n\nHe warned, however, that the app would not be able to — and shouldn't be able to — let people know whether the person standing next to them in line at the grocery store is infected.\n\nRead more: Will Germans trade privacy for coronavirus protection?\n\nFollowing a phone conference with state leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also spoke in favor of tracking apps.\n\n\"It's clear that it would be on a voluntary basis, but if the testing of these apps shows them to be good and set to be successful in better tracing cases of where there has been contact, I'd certainly be in favor of recommending that to citizens,\" she said.\n\n\"I would of course also be prepared to use it myself to perhaps help other people,\" she added.\n\n1540 In Israel, the defense minister on Wednesday appeared to tie potential coronavirus aid for the Gaza Strip to an attempt to get back the remains of two Israeli soldiers who died in 2014.\n\nGaza, which currently has 12 reported cases of coronavirus, has just 96 ventilators for its population of 2 million. The impoverished Palestinian territory does not have the infrastructure to contain an outbreak.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett told reporters that it would \"not be right\" to disconnect aid for Gaza from Israel recovering the soldiers' remains.\n\n\"The moment there is talk of the humanitarian world in Gaza. Israel also has humanitarian needs, which are mainly the recovery of the fallen,\" Bennett of the soldiers whose remains are being held by Hamas, Gaza's Islamist governing authority.\n\nIt was unclear whether Bennett was referring to the possibility of Israel providing aid directly, or of the country allowing the transfer of aid over its borders.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum rejected the idea. \"Israel bears responsibility for any consequences should the disease spread in Gaza because it has been blockading it for 13 years,\" he said. \"A prisoner swap deal is a separate track.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli authorities are also considering a full lockdown for the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak, a crowded ultra-Orthodox suburb with around 730 known cases of coronavirus.\n\nThe suburb of 200,000 has the second-highest number of infections in the country after Jerusalem.

The shops are closed. Even a healthy company like Adidas cannot stand this for long,\" Adidas said in an open letter sent to several media outlets.\n\nThe German sportswear giant said it understood criticism levied against it from customers and politicians alike.\n\n\"We would, therefore, like to apologize to you formally. We have paid our landlords the rent for April,\" Adidas said.\n\n13:13 In France, the death toll rose to over 4,000 with many of those who died coming from the eastern region of Grand Est, along the border with Germany.

Eleven of the victims were frontline doctors. Infections have more than doubled over the same period to 1,677. Experts fear figures of coronavirus cases are much higher, as testing rates are low.\n\nAn 11-year-old girl has become the country's youngest person to die after contracting the coronavirus, officials said. The girl was also suffering from dengue fever and died a day after being admitted to hospital on March 19. Tests only confirmed this week that the child also had COVID-19.\n\n11:55 The Philippines has recorded 227 new coronavirus cases and eight more deaths, the country's Health Ministry said, bringing the total number of infections and deaths to 2,311 and 96, respectively.\n\nResidents of a slum area in the capital Manila staged a protest, demanding basic emergency relief goods such as food amid a month-long lockdown that has left many of them without work. Police arrested 20 of the protesters after they refused to go back to their homes.\n\n11:07 Russia President Vladimir Putin will hold a government meeting later today by video conference, a day after a doctor who met with Putin last week said he had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin's health is fine, but that he is choosing to keep his distance from other people and preferred to work remotely.\n\nThe doctor, Denis Protsenko, had given Putin a tour of Moscow's main coronavirus hospital in Moscow and shook the leader's hand.\n\n10:50 Here's an overview of the latest numbers from some of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic:\n\nIn Iran, the death toll from the virus reached 3,036, with 138 deaths in the past 24 hours, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV. He said the country had 47,593 infected cases — 2,987 of which had been declared in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe United States is now the country with by far the highest number of COVID-19 cases — a total of 189,633 — according to the Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The figures include 4,081 fatalities, around a quarter of which are in New York City.\n\nSecond-most affected is Italy, which has 105,792 cases of infection, according to the JHU tally. It thus far has a much higher death rate, with 12,428 fatalities.\n\nGlobally, there have been 873,767 infection cases and 43,228 deaths as a result of the pandemic.\n\n10:33 In an interview with DW, Jan Egeland, Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said refugee camps require global solidarity to tackle coronavirus, stressing that as long as the virus can spread to the more vulnerable, the coronavirus pandemic can never be dealt with.\n\nWatch video 01:10 Egeland: 'We're overwhelmed, we're overstretched'\n\nEgeland warned that the highly contagious virus poses a significant threat to refugees, as the virus can thrive in congested camps and settlements. He said the NRC is working to provide more handwashing facilities, more water and sanitation to camps in Afghanistan, in Iran and in 30 other countries.\n\n\"We're overwhelmed, overstretched … There must be more injection of humanitarian aid,\" Egeland said.\n\nThe non-governmental organization is also trying to provide more space for refugees so they have physical distance from each other.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: Urgent appeal for evacuation of Greek refugee camps\n\nWatch video 01:44 Share Coronavirus looms over Lesbos refugee camp Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3aBCr Coronavirus catastrophe looms over Lesbos refugee camp\n\n10:15 Japan is on the brink of crisis, with medical experts particularly worried about preparations for an upsurge in coronavirus cases in Tokyo, officials say.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that controlling the virus was a top priority. He said the Japanese government would do \"whatever is needed.\"\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has shied away from declaring a state of emergency. Even if it were declared, he said, it would not mean he could order an immediate nationwide lockdown of cities, such as in France. Any emergency declaration would allow prefectural governors to make necessary requests and give orders, he said.\n\nAbe said that even if Japan could avoid an explosive spread of the coronavirus, the country was expected to \"remain on the brink for a long time.\"\n\nJapan has some 2,229 COVID-19 cases and 57 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University — far lower than numbers from the United States, Europe and China. However, new infections continue to set fresh daily records.\n\nRead more: Tokyo 2020 postponement poses Herculean financial challenge\n\n09:52 The number of coronavirus infections in Spain has risen to 102,136, the Health Ministry announced Wednesday.

A mask must be provided to shoppers upon entry; alternatively, customers will be allowed to wear their own mask.\n\nThe biggest challenge for stores would be sourcing the up to 4 million masks per day, Rainer Will, head of the country's trade association, told Austrian public broadcaster ORF.\n\nA spokesperson for the grocery store chain Spar called on customers in Austria to stagger their store-visiting times, Bavarian broadcaster BR24 reported.\n\nFace masks are in short global supply, with reports of frontline medical workers in some countries being told to share face masks and other protective gear.\n\nPamela Fidler-Stolz, reporting for Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung, was handed a mask on entry at her local supermarket and said it was very straight-forward: \"It was very relaxed and there was enough masks: One store worker controlled the entry of customers, and asked each person to take a mask out the stand on entry.\"\n\n07:56 The UK is aiming to increase the number of tests for coronavirus to 25,000 a day by the middle of April from its current capacity of 12,750 a day, Housing Minister Robert Jenrick told Sky News on Wednesday.\n\nThe UK is beginning to test medical staff in addition to patients in hospitals. According to Jenrick, 8,240 individuals were tested on Monday and more than 900 health workers were tested over the weekend.\n\nThere are currently 25,481 positive cases in the UK, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nGuidelines for coronavirus testing vary from country to country. Countries where testing is only being done on patients with severe symptoms are believed to have a larger number of unknown cases.\n\nSouth Korea took the lead in widespread coronavirus testing, and many attribute Germany's broad testing to the country's low fatality rate. Virologist Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the coronavirus at Berlin's Charite hospital, has estimated that Germany is now capable of carrying out 500,000 coronavirus tests a week.\n\nRead more: Is comparing coronavirus death rates futile?\n\n07:39 Colombia confirmed its first coronavirus cases among the country's indigenous people, Reuters reported, citing local authorities.

It has already barred individuals from entering the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nUp to 2 million Muslims perform the yearly pilgrimage, one of the central pillars of Islam. Canceling the hajj would be unprecedented in modern times, but limiting attendance from high-risk areas has happened before, such as during the Ebola outbreak.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Millions of Muslim Pilgrims The hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the most holy city for Muslims. All Muslims are expected to perform this religious duty at least once in their lifetime if they are physically and financially able. It is one of the five pillars of Islam, or core ritual practices, and considered to be the largest gathering of people in the world, with millions attending every year.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Following the prophet As many as three million pilgrims perform a series of rituals over the course of five or six days. First, they stop to pray at the Grand Mosque, home to a cubic building draped in black silk called the Kaaba, Islam’s most important shrine.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Stoning the devil Pilgrims travel to the village of Mina to again pray and read from the Quran. Next they spend a day at Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed gave his final sermon, to ask for forgiveness. On their return journey to Mecca, the pilgrims stop on a plain called Muzdalifah to collect stones, which they will throw at three pillars in Mina to symbolically stone the devil.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Circling Kaaba Finally, upon returning to Mecca, the pilgrims will circle the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque seven times, bringing their hajj to a close. They then shave their heads and perform an animal sacrifice before celebrating the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Tragedy during hajj Since 1987, more than 5,800 people have died in building collapses, stampedes, trampling and fires. In 2015, a stampede resulted in around 2,400 deaths, making it the worst catastrophe in the history of hajj. The pilgrimage is also a hotbed of infectious disease, as pilgrims from every corner of the planet often trek around in the heat barefoot and share tight sleeping quarters.\n\nWhat is the hajj? Bringing the new to the old While the hajj is the oldest and most sacred ritual of Islam, it has also been brought into the 21st Century. The Saudi government is using the latest in crowd-control techniques to prevent trampling and architectural collapses. On YouTube, they telecast live hajj and now, Google, iTunes and other sites have come out with hajj apps to help pilgrims better understand and perform the hajj rituals.\n\n\n\n06:45 Taiwan has said it will donate 10 million masks to the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe island, which is the world's second-largest mask producer, will send 7 million masks to 11 European countries including Italy, Spain and Germany.\n\nThe United States will receive 2 million masks, Germany's DPA news agency reported, with a further 1 million masks to be sent to the 15 countries with which Taiwan has diplomatic relations.\n\nTaiwan soon expects to be able to make 15 million surgical masks a day.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center said there had been 322 total cases of COVID-19 on the island, including five deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, President Tsai Ing-wen announced a financial stimulus valuing some $35 billion (€31 billion) to cushion the impact of the coronavirus on the Taiwanese economy.\n\nRead more: How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?\n\nWatch video 03:10 Is the virus under control in China and Taiwan? – DW's Phoebe Kong reports\n\n06:23 China's National Health Commission says it has recorded 36 new cases of the COVID-19 disease in one day, after announcing that asymptomatic cases would be included in the official count from now on. It did not say if any of the new cases was asymptomatic.\n\nThe commission said all but one of the new cases was imported from abroad. It also added that there had been seven more deaths from the disease in the past 24 hours.\n\nChina’s National Health Commission has reported 1,367 asymptomatic cases under observation as of Tuesday. The country announced earlier on Wednesday that is was extending screening to asymptomatic cases and the people with whom they have been in contact.\n\nThe data comes amid scrutiny of figures reported by the Chinese authorities, which previously only included those people who exhibited symptoms. The proportion of people who have contracted the virus but remain asymptomatic is currently unknown, but experts have estimated it could be as high as 30%. According to scientists, these carriers can still pass COVID-19 onto others who do become sick.\n\nWhile China's domestic outbreak has largely subsided, questions have arisen over whether the country's failure to count asymptomatic cases would lead to a resurgence of infections.\n\nChina, where the novel coronavirus was first detected in December, has recorded a total of 81,554 cases of COVID-19 and 3,312 deaths from the disease.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: China's Wuhan prepares for the uncertain end of COVID-19\n\n05:47 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the coronavirus pandemic amounted to humanity's worst crisis since World War II, with the outbreak threatening people in every country.\n\nGuterres said the disease and measures taken against it would likely bring about a recession \"that probably has no parallel in the recent past.\"\n\nThe effect of both the disease and its economic impact will contribute to \"enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict,\" the UN chief said at the launch on Tuesday of a report into the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19.\n\n\"We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the United Nations — one that is killing people, spreading human suffering, and upending people's lives,\" the report said.\n\n\"This is much more than a health crisis. It is a human crisis. The coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core.\"\n\nEarlier, Guterres announced a new trust fund that would help some countries respond to the emergency and recover from its effects at a social and economic level.\n\n05:40 German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to meet state premiers from across Germany on Wednesday to discuss the effect that anti-coronavirus measures are having.\n\nGermany introduced strict contact restrictions about 10 days ago, banning meetings between more than two people not from the same household outside of the workplace.\n\nIt is expected that the latest discussions will include a debate over an obligation to wear masks in public places. Austria announced such a measure on Monday, triggering discussions in Germany. Some municipalities in the eastern state of Thuringia have already issued decrees for masks to be mandatory in supermarkets, buses and trains.\n\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn on Tuesday said he was against making it obligatory for protective masks to be worn.\n\nWatch video 01:53 Share Are face masks effective?

This makes it the country with the fifth-highest level of infection in the world, although this has been partly attributed to the widespread testing being carried out in the country. The university data also shows a total of 775 deaths as a result of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), put the death toll in the country at 732 as of early Wednesday and the total number of infection cases at 67,366. The RKI sometimes has a slight time lag in updating its data because it collates figures submitted by regional and local authorities.\n\nThe agency's data showed infections had increased by 5,453 compared with the previous day, while the death toll had experienced a sharp rise of 149.\n\n04:29 The death toll in the US from the novel coronavirus pandemic has reached 4,076 — double the number from three days prior, the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland reported. The total number of infections has reached 189,510 nationwide, according to the same statistics. Experts have predicted that up to 240,000 individuals in the US could die as a result of the outbreak.\n\n03:51 In sharp change from his usual tone on the coronavirus pandemic, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro acknowledged the danger posed by the outbreak. \"The virus is a reality,\" he said in a televised speech on Tuesday. \"We are standing in front of one of the greatest challenges of our generation.\"\n\nPreviously, Bolsonaro dismissed the virus as a \"little flu,\" criticized lockdowns imposed by local authorities, and flaunted social distancing recommendations from his own government by meeting groups of his supporters. He also repeatedly urged Brazilians to return to work.\n\nIn the Tuesday speech, Bolsonaro once again voiced his concerns over the economy and warned that the cure against the outbreak cannot be worse than the pandemic itself.\n\n03:33 Taiwan's government will provide an economic stimulus of over $1 trillion, (€907 billion) to mitigate coronavirus fallout, said President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday.\n\nRead more: How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?\n\n03:27 German police believe anti-pandemic isolation measures are causing a rise in domestic violence.

They would be followed by prisoners with less than 60 days remaining of their term.\n\n\"We do not take these new measures lightly,\" CDCR Secretary Ralph Diaz said in a statement. \"However, in the face of a global pandemic, we must consider the risk of COVID-19 infection as a grave threat to safety, too.\"\n\n03:14 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier joined several heads of state to urge a \"new global alliance\" against the coronavirus in a letter published by the Financial Times on Wednesday.\n\n\"This pandemic will not spare any country, no matter how advanced its economy, capabilities, or technology,\" the leaders said in a letter also signed by Singapore's President Halimah Yacob, Ethiopia's Sahle-Work Zewde, Ecuador's Lenin Moreno, as well as Jordan's King Abdullah II.\n\n\"This is a global crisis,\" the letter states. \"Delay in action means death.\" Among other measures, the heads of state called for boosting research into treatments and vaccines, and \"fair and equitable\" distribution of medical equipment ant testing kits. \"A global solution is in everybody's self-interest,\" they said.\n\n03:00 Germany's Bayreuth Festival, the annual opera event honoring composer Richard Wagner, has been canceled due to the coronavirus.\n\nThe popular music festival had been set to start in late July and last until late August.

Ireland's famous March 17 parades were also previously cancelled in 2001 during an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Vatican museums With quarantine measures in place in northern Italy, soccer matches occurring without spectators, and Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte's order to close museums, theaters and cinemas, it should come as no surprise that the Vatican has closed the doors to its museums, including the Sistine Chapel (above), until probably April 3. In the Vatican itself, five people are currently in quarantine.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled South by Southwest (SXSW) This annual music, film and tech festival held in Austin, Texas, usually attracts more than 400,000 visitors.

It's the first Hollywood blockbuster to shift its release schedule in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival cancelled Venice Architecture Biennale The start of the world's most prestigious architecture biennale has also been delayed.

US officials cited by the Reuters news agency said that nearly 80 people aboard the nuclear-powered warship had tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he had not read the letter in detail, but added it was not the time to evacuate the ship. \"I don't think we're at that point,\" he told CNN.\n\n00:30 US President Donald Trump hinted at expanding travel restrictions on Tuesday, saying that he was \"absolutely\" considering a ban on Brazil and several other countries.\n\nIn February and March, the US administration introduced bans on travelers from China and virtually all western European countries in a bid to curb the spread COVID-19.
