            "content": "Greenhouse gas emissions from methane, which largely originates from natural gas production and agriculture, have been underestimated by 25% to 40% compared to recent gauges, per a new study in the peer-reviewed journal Nature.\n\nWhy it matters: Methane gas is more potent than CO2 at trapping heat on a pound-for-pound basis in the short-term, which makes it an important factor to weigh as countries tackle global warming.\n\nWhat they found: Ancient samples of air from Greenland's ice sheets contained \"very little of the oldest type of methane — multimillion-year-old fossil methane gas,\" the Washington Post reports. This suggests that the Earth's current methane-addled atmosphere is caused by humans exploiting fossil fuels.\n\nWhat they're saying: Harvard atmospheric scientist and methane expert Daniel Jacob told the Post that the study represented an “important result, because the current estimates for the methane geological source were widely considered too high by atmospheric modelers such as myself.”\n\nYes, but: Jacob told the Post that he disagreed with the study's inference that smaller fossil methane sources means that humans should increase emissions from another source.\n\nGo deeper: New methane capture method could reduce global warming by one-sixth"

            "content": "Kevin McCarthy and Donald Trump. | AP Photo/Evan Vucci Trump bashes California leaders during Bakersfield visit to celebrate new water rules\n\nBAKERSFIELD — President Donald Trump on Wednesday dropped into one of the few regions in California that has embraced his presidency to celebrate new federal rules delivering more water to Central Valley farmers and rolling back protections for fish.\n\nTrump basked in the cheers from 2,000 supporters in an airplane hangar on the outskirts of the agriculture- and oil-focused city represented by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, immediately taking aim at the state's Democratic leaders in Sacramento.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“What they're doing to your state is a disgrace,\" Trump said. \"After decades of failure and delays in ensuring critical water rights for the people of the state, we are determined to finally get your problems solved.\"\n\nThe official water \"record of decision\" was signed Wednesday, outlining endangered species rules for California's main water hub. Central Valley politicians have railed for years against water restrictions intended to help salmon and smelt that inhabit the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and Delta further north.\n\nThe issue is red meat for the agriculture-heavy Central Valley and its lawmakers, including McCarthy and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). A day earlier, Nunes hosted a forum in his district highlighting the new rules with Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, refusing access to several media outlets, including POLITICO.\n\nAfter focusing on water Wednesday, Trump rolled through several of his anti-California greatest hits. He called San Francisco \"worse than a slum\" and said \"the federal government's going to have to step in,\" apparently referring to taking action on homelessness.\n\nHe then mocked Gov. Gavin Newsom and state officials for fighting his administration on auto emissions rules and high-speed rail. Trump said a car made under his rules \"would be safer because it would not be made out of papier-mache.\" He also joked that state leaders would eventually shorten the San Francisco to Los Angeles line so much that \"pretty soon it'll be like a mile long,\" referring to Newsom's announcement a year ago that the state would focus on a track running from Merced to Bakersfield.\n\nThe president was in Los Angeles on Tuesday to discuss the 2028 Olympics with city officials. Trump is also appearing with Republican members of Congress and attending fundraisers in California this week, though he flew back to Las Vegas last night to stay at his hotel, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe Trump administration estimates the new water rules will increase deliveries by 600,000 acre-feet in an average year, about a 10 percent increase over average deliveries of 5 million acre-feet. The rules from the Interior and Commerce departments are intended to meet Endangered Species Act requirements and revise a set of Obama-era protections for endangered salmon and Delta smelt.\n\nThe \"biological opinions\" incorporate more flexible pumping rules that would let managers of the massive set of canals, reservoirs and pumping plants take more water from the Delta by using \"real-time management\" to only restrict water exports when endangered fish are near the pumps, for example.\n\nThe opinions also envision building a hatchery to increase smelt populations and changing rules that require a certain amount of cold water to remain behind Shasta Dam to support salmon downstream in the Sacramento River.\n\nNewsom has yet to follow up on his November threat to sue the Trump administration over the rules. His Department of Water Resources has come out with its own plan for operating the state side of the pumps that still remains to be finalized. Wednesday's signing of the record of decision opens the way for Newsom and others to sue the Bureau of Reclamation over the plan.\n\n“We will file legal action in the coming days to challenge the federal biological opinions to protect highly imperiled fish species close to extinction,\" Newsom said in a statement Wednesday. \"Our goal continues to be to realize enforceable voluntary agreements that provide the best immediate protection for Delta species, reliable and safe drinking water, and dependable water sources for our farmers for economic prosperity.\"\n\nSome environmental advocates pointed out that Newsom could already have sued the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration over their role, as environmental and fishing groups did in December.\n\n\"I can't explain why the governor has not followed through on his commitment to sue,\" said Kate Poole, senior director of the Natural Resources Defense Counsel's water program.\n\nThough Wednesday's actions focus largely on water for farms, Trump chided Newsom for state legislation signed before Newsom took office. State lawmakers and former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018 enacted bills establishing a 50 gallon per person daily standard by 2030.\n\n\"I heard the governor say you get 50 gallons. Does 50 gallons sound okay?\" Trump said \"Fifty gallons is very, very little. Can you imagine a state being rationed when you have millions and millions and millions of gallons being poured out into the Pacific Ocean?\""

Discuss the current status of food grain production in India and associated challenges. (250 words)\n\nReference: The Hindu\n\nWhy this question:\n\nThe Agriculture Ministry’s second advance estimates were released recently, consequently forcing us to probe the current status of food grain production in India and associated challenges.\n\nKey demand of the question:\n\nThe question is pretty much direct and aims to assess the current status of food grain production in India and challenges associated with it.\n\nDirective:\n\nDiscuss – This is an all-encompassing directive – you have to debate on paper by going through the details of the issues concerned by examining each one of them. You have to give reasons for both for and against arguments.\n\nStructure of the answer:\n\nIntroduction:\n\nStart with the key highlights of the estimate.\n\nBody:\n\nNote the following facts and use them to provide for a brief analysis of the current scenario –\n\nTotal food grain production is projected to scale an all-time high of almost 292 million tonnes in 2019-20, propelled by record production of both rice and wheat.\n\nProduction of several crops, including rice and major pulses, was lower than targeted in the kharif or the monsoon season. However, the abundance of late monsoon rains resulted in cumulative rainfall that was 10% higher than the long-period average for the season. This helped farmers rake in rabi or winter harvests that were larger-than expected in almost all crops.\n\nThus, the estimate for total food grain output of 291.95 million tonnes is more than six million tonnes higher than the 285.21 million tonnes produced in 2018-19.\n\nThe Agriculture Ministry expects rice production to reach 117.47 million tonnes, slightly higher than the 116.48 million tonnes produced in 2019. Wheat, which is only grown in the rabi season, will see a major surge in production at 106.2 million tonnes in the current year, from the 103.6 million tonnes in 2018-19.\n\nDiscuss the challenges involved – Despite the government’s drive to encourage millets and nutri-cereals, production failed to match targets this year.\n\nExplain the story with Pulses, oil seeds, the sudden peak in sugarcane production etc.\n\nConclusion:\n\nConclude with what needs to be done for effective and efficient management of food grains in the country."

The government says it’s trying to raise more than $19 million to battle the infestation.\n\nSouth Sudan Food and Agriculture Minister Onyoti Adigo said a mature swarm of locusts entered South Sudan on Monday.\n\n“Yesterday we received a report that the desert locust had entered South Sudan from Magwi County and we thought it was a normal grasshopper as it was reported early. But our team and those of FAO (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization) sent people there and they confirmed the presence of locusts in Magwi County’s Lobonok, Owinykibul and Panyikwar,” Adigo told reporters in Juba Tuesday.\n\nThe locusts crossed into the southeast area of Magwi County from northern Uganda’s Lamwo district.\n\nThe locust infestation spreading across a swath of Eastern Africa is considered the worst in decades, and the pests have caused huge crop losses in several countries, heightening worries about food insecurity for millions of people.\n\nMeshack Malo, the country representative for the FAO, said his agency is working with South Sudan’s agriculture ministry to prevent the locusts from spreading nationwide.“\n\nThe population of about 2,000 that has arrived are mature,\" and the sandy nature of the land in Magwi County is \"a good environment for them to lay eggs,\" Malo told VOA's South Sudan in Focus. He said the FAO and agriculture ministry are discussing the best counter-measures. One option is to freeze the locusts where they lay eggs.\n\nJames Janka, South Sudan’s minister for livestock and fisheries, said the locusts will adversely affect many South Sudanese communities, especially in terms of crop production.“\n\nWe are also afraid [for] the livestock,\" he said, because the locusts could consume grass and deprive cattle of grazing areas.\n\nJanka said desert locusts are not a nationwide issue at the moment but a regional one, which requires collective action to prevent the swarms from spreading any further."

Express SAD leaders Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and Bikram Singh Majithia speak to the media on Wednesday. Express\n\nThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Legislative Party on Wednesday demanded a fifteen-day Budget Session to discuss issues like power hike and alleged power scams besides the “need to provide justice to the victims of the Behbal Kalan police firing case”.\n\nSAD submitted a memorandum in this regard to Vidhan Sabha Speaker Rana K P Singh. Addressing the media after submitting the memorandum, SAD Legislative Party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said the party had appealed to the Speaker to extend the forthcoming Budget Session to fifteen days, saying “presently only one day had been kept to discuss the Governor’s Address, what to speak of taking up public issues”.\n\nSAD leaders, as per a written statement issued by the party, said the people of Punjab were “reeling under the all time high power hikes which had taken power rates to Rs 9 to Rs 10 per unit from only Rs 5.50 per unit during SAD-BJP tenure”.\n\nThey said the Congress government should fulfill its promise to supply power to the people as well as industry at Rs 5 per unit. SAD leaders demanded “an independent inquiry into the Rs 4300 crore scam” and said “why the Punjab Pollution Control Board had worked over time to save private thermal plants from action for not installing anti-pollution devices”.\n\nThey also demanded “threadbare discussion into the pressure being put on witnesses of the Behbal Kalan police firing case to rescind from their statements”.\n\nDhillon and Majithia said that Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had uttered a white lie by claiming that eleven lakh youth had been given jobs.\n\n“Punjabis are asking for the name of these fictitious job receivers. Not only this, they want to know why unemployment allowance of Rs 2,500 per month is still not being given. Similarly, one lakh students had suffered and not taken admission in colleges after the government failed to provide SC scholarship to them. The Dalit community was also waiting anxiously for the government to announce that it would ensure status quo on job reservation and promotions in government service but is dismayed that the government has kept quiet on this subject,” said the statement by the Akali leaders.\n\nThe Akali leaders demanded a discussion on alleged “loot of the state exchequer by Congress leaders be it through illegal mining or liquor smuggling as well as police-gangster-minister nexus which had resulted in jails becoming a centre for extortion and contract killings with five NRIs being targeted recently”. They claimed that the law and order situation was such that police were clueless after dacoits decamped with 30 kg of gold in Ludhiana.\n\nAkali leaders accused the Congress government on going back on its complete loan waiver promise. They alleged that farm suicide victims were not being given the promised Rs 10 lakh compensation as well as promised jobs, adding that sugarcane farmers were “suffering because they were not paid Rs 350 crore dues from government mills alone and that this along with low State Assured Price (SAP) for sugarcane had sounded the death knell of diversification in agriculture in the state”.\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "content": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nEU leaders are meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the bloc's future budget plans.\n\nThese negotiations are always challenging, tending to pit net payers against net beneficiaries.\n\nThere are proposals from the European Commission and the Parliament that some countries think involve spending too much.\n\nThis time, the talks are further complicated by the departure of the UK, which was a large net contributor.\n\nThe talks are about the EU's long term budget or financial framework. It will set out the total spending level and the amount to be spent on particular areas over the next seven years.\n\nThe current framework runs to the end of this year, so the new one will cover the period up to 2027.\n\nTough talks\n\nIt is always a tough negotiating challenge. The countries which put in more than is spent by the EU within their own borders tend to want restraint. There's a group seeking that known as the frugal four: the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark.\n\nBut countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the South want to protect spending on agriculture and what is called 'cohesion', money intended help to the EU's poorer regions.\n\nThese could well face cuts, as there are also proposals for the new framework which involve increases in other areas. Poland is an important voice in this group, sometimes known as the 'friends of cohesion'.\n\nThe biggest contributor of all is Germany and it shares the frugal four's desire to restrain spending. The next biggest payer is France which has a strong farmers' lobby pulling in the opposite direction.\n\nEU spending is quite small compared to the budgets of national governments. In the current seven year period it was fixed at 1% of the EU economy, its GDP.\n\nBy contrast, what member countries spend on themselves compared to their national economies is much higher, more than 50% for several of them.\n\nEven so, the size of the EU budget matters a lot to EU leaders, financially and also politically.\n\nThey want to be able to claim to the audience at home that they have achieved their aims and looked after their national financial interests.\n\nBrexit pressures\n\nSo the negotiations are tough, as they were back in 2013 when the British Prime Minster David Cameron claimed a great success in curbing the EU's spending limits for the next seven year period.\n\nThis time the same pressures are there, with the added complication of the UK's departure.\n\nThe UK's total contribution in 2018 was £17.4bn but that was before the UK rebate, which is paid by other member states, and spending on EU programmes in the UK.\n\nNeither of those will feature in the future financial framework, and deducting them leaves a hole of £9bn to be filled.\n\nThat is less than 0.1% of the GDP in 2018 of the remaining 27 EU countries, but it is still enough to be a problem.\n\nThe Austrian leader, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, writing in the Financial Times on behalf of the frugal four, referred to the UK's departure as a reason for financial restraint: \"Now that we have a smaller union of 27 member states, we simply have to cut our coat according to our cloth\".\n\nSpending changes\n\nEU spending priorities have changed and that will probably continue.\n\nAgriculture does not dominate the budget in the way it used to. It was more than 70% of total spending in 1986 and is now less than 40%. That decline is likely to continue.\n\nThe European Commission proposal for the next seven years for example takes it down to below 30%, including spending on fisheries.\n\nThat proposal includes spending more in the future on security, student exchanges in the form the Erasmus programme, the external border, digital issues, and the environment, including climate change.\n\nEven when the leaders do agree at this summit or a future one, they will still have to seek approval from the European Parliament which wants to increase spending.\n\nOne indication that this could be a challenging summit is in the invitation to leaders sent by the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, who will chair it.\n\nHe wrote that the summit would begin on 20 February. That's all he had to say on the timing; no indication of when it would finish. And his published schedule for the week has nothing for Friday. It could be a very long night."

K. Saseendran and Agriculture Minister V. S. Sivakumar are on their way to the spot to coordinate relief operations.

The bodies of the deceased are in the morgues in Tirupur and Avinash Government hospitals. Efforts were on to identify the dead.\n\nThe casualties include at least three women. The passengers had boarded the KSRTC bus from Bengaluru to Kerala late on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials said the accident occurred around 3.15 a.m. when the container lorry lost control, jumped the divider separating the carriageways and rammed into the side of the oncoming passenger bus. Those on the right side of the bus bore the brunt of the collision.\n\nThe police said the container lorry was ferrying floor tiles from Kochi port to Bengaluru. Preliminary reports from Tamil Nadu police suggested a tyre burst had caused the truck to lose control and encroach into the opposite lane. Officials said it was also possible that the driver of the container truck had nodded off. The police said the truck crew had fled immediately after the collision."

(Clockwise from left) In Mohali, the focus is on growing vegetables like pumpkin, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ladyfinger etc in summer and cabbage, carrots, cauliflower etc in winter.\n\nIt was in 2018 that 44 families from Mohali and Chandigarh came together to do community farming on two acre land. The number has now gone up to 60 families and the land doubled to four acres on the Mohali-Siswan road. Every family that is part of the project pays Rs 24,000 per year each.\n\nIt all began in early 2018, when Dr Sachin Gupta, HoD, medical oncology department at Max hospital, Mohali, attended a workshop on organic farming organised by NGO Kheti Virasat Mission in Ludhiana. Dr Gupta said,”I am a cancer specialist and I am aware that how pesticides are causing harm to human bodies, hence the idea clicked soon after attending the workshop. I made a WhatsApp group of my friends and shared the idea. Soon, a friend, Dr Sameer Goyal, came up with an idea to give his two acres agriculture land on lease to us. He was doing contract farming done on his four acres land. So we took the 2 acres land on contract in October 2018 at Rs 40,000 per acre. Initially, we were 44 families, including Dr Goyal. After hiring four workers, we started organic farming.” He added: “Our focus was to grow vegetables which can thus be distributed to all the families. We focused on vegetable farming and grew seasonal vegetables in January 2019 after making the land ready for organic farming. Intially we charged Rs 12,000 per annum per family and hence we started getting summer and winter vegetables such as pumpkin, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ladyfinger etc in summer while cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, methi (fenugreek), palak (spinach), sarson (mustard) etc. in winters. Potatoes, onions, garlic is also part of our project as these items are used on a regular basis.”\n\nDr Gupta says that farming made them realise that farmers are paid peanuts for their crops. “One of our members also works as a manager to manage every thing and also to help in delivering the vegetables to all houses…Around 200 fruit trees of jamun, mango, guava, peach, shehtoot etc are being added apart from increasing the area under vegetables as families have also increased. We have installed our own tubewell,” he said, adding that per family charges have increased to Rs 24,000 per annum. “This includes, lease money, salary of employees who have been increased to eight now and many other expenses as well. We have plans to create our own seed bank so as to reduce the cost of purchasing seeds,” said Dr Gupta, revealing that for wheat and rice, they “tie up with organic farmers and buy in bulk”.\n\nFazilka\n\nIn the border district of Fazilka, two neighbours are working on a similar principle. Subodh Verma and his neighbour Dr Rajesh Sharma do organic farming on 1.5 acres of land. Subodh said,”We have cultivated sarson, turmeric, chillies, barley, wheat in some part while seasonal vegetables, onion garlic, potato in another. We also have purchased our own machine through which we take out mustard oil out from mustard seeds which suffices our annual need for cooking oil. Turmeric and chillies processed using our own machines to make masalas throughout the year. We produce barley and wheat, while rice we get from farmers who grow it naturally. Now, we are looking for rearing desi cows as we want to have milk that is free from impurities. We don’t know as what is being added in the milk being delivered to us by companies.” He added that the per year yield is enough for both families. Both families spend around Rs 15,000 per month that includes salary of employee as well.\n\nLudhiana\n\nIn Ludhiana’s Issewal village, however, group farming is being done in one acre land by 20 families on land taken from a local industrialist Maneet Dewan. Amrita Mangat, a member of this group, said,”Maneet gave us this land for free and we are spending Rs 2500 per month per family to meet expenses. We are focusing on growing vegetables only on this land. Fruits, cereals are coming from farmers who do natural farming and hence we pool in to purchase even those products as well. We are trying our best to east everything grown naturally….We are doing group farming for more than 5 years now.”\n\nOn Hambaran road, on the outskirts of Ludhiana, Neerja Jain grows her own vegetables on a one acre plot of land that is owned by her cousin.\n\nShe said: “It was a jungle when I visited that area in early 2018. We started cleaning the wild growth of grass, prepared the soil and slowly and in September, started sowing vegetables. Last winter, we tasted vegetables grown in our own farm. We spend Rs 40,000 to get the farm ready and now bear running expenses. The vegetables are shared among relatives and even some of our workers.” Neerja, who runs a boutique in an upmarket Ludhiana locality, says that now 15 families have joined the chain.\n\n“Farmers like Chamkaur Singh, who does organic farming in Ludhiana, Anirudh Kumar, a farmer from Sunam, visited my farm and guided me a lot as how to go about it,” she said, adding that community members pay as less as Rs 500 per month and take vegetables home as they mature.\n\nRakesh Kharbanda, a chemist who is part of the group, “It is wonderful to do group farming and share vegetables as per your family size.”\n\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(NYSE:NTR)\n\nQ4 2019 Earnings Call\n\n, 10:00 a.m. ET\n\nContents:\n\nPrepared Remarks\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nCall Participants\n\nPrepared Remarks:\n\nOperator\n\nGreetings, and welcome to Nutrien's 2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Downey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Downey -- Vice President, Investor and Corporate Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Nutrien's conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2019 results and outlook. On the phone with us today is Mr. Chuck Magro, President and CEO of Nutrien; Mr. Pedro Farah, our CFO; and the heads of our three business units.\n\nAs we conduct this conference call, various statements that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects contain forward-looking information. Certain material assumptions were applied in making these conclusions and forecasts, therefore, actual results could differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking information. Additional information about these factors and assumptions are contained in our current quarterly report to our shareholders as well as our most recent annual report, MD&A and annual information form filed with Canadian and U.S. security commissions, to which we direct you.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Magro.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. The fourth quarter was the continuation of a challenging year in agriculture, driven by geopolitical issues, short-term weather anomalies and other market drivers. These headwinds virtually eliminated all global growth for crop inputs in 2019 and setback the cyclical recovery we started to see in 2018.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, we experienced another condensed fall application window and associated price weakness. But looking forward into 2020, we expect global ag markets to recover as we move through the year. Overall, we are positive on crop input demand this spring across North America. This is due to the expected increase in seeded acreage, improved cash crop margins and farmers wanting to catch up on fertilizer applications after the past three seasons with a suboptimal window. The recent U.S.-China trade agreement has also improved U.S. farmer sentiment.\n\nFor potash, we expect the rebound in global demand, driven by increases in the U.S. and Southeast Asia with stronger applications in Indonesia and Malaysia, due to the dramatic rise in palm oil prices over the past four months. However, short-term shipments to China remain uncertain, as a drawdown port inventory and the coronavirus has limited product movements. For nitrogen, U.S. prices have shown signs of recovery and we anticipate strong global demand to provide stability in 2020, despite the recent impact from lower global energy prices.\n\nNutrien was created to withstand the variances in the global crop input markets that can arise from time to time. We have the ability to generate more stable earnings than our peers and to make highly accretive investments through the cycle, while still maintaining our ability to capture significant leverage to higher fertilizer volumes and prices as the markets improve. We captured $650 million in synergies from the merger and continue to execute on our strategic plan, despite the headwinds experienced in the second half of the year.\n\nWe also generated significant free cash flow for both the quarter and the year, with $2.6 billion in free cash flow or $4.54 per share, which was supported by a reduction in working capital. Even after excluding changes in working capital, we generated, $2.2 billion in free cash flow in 2019 or $3.70 per share.\n\nOur adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.5 times, which is essentially at the middle of our target range, and this is in a year, which we would consider to be near or at the bottom of the cycle. We also purchased over 36 million shares in 2019 and continue to be active in the market in 2020.\n\nNow let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results. Total adjusted EBITDA was up modestly in 2019, due to good results from our retail business, solid operational performance, the continued benefit from merger synergies, and a focus on cost control. This more than offset the impact from the significant weather challenges in North America and Australia trade uncertainties and the softening of global fertilizer market conditions in the second half of 2019.\n\nNutrien's adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $664 million after accounting for a number of charges totaling $128 million related to M&A activities. The largest of these was about $50 million charge related to the Ruralco acquisition. This will also be the last quarter that items related to the merger will be reported on. On a business unit basis, our Retail Q4 EBITDA was 8% higher in the fourth quarter of 2019 than last year and 2% higher on an annual basis.\n\nGross margins in the fourth quarter were higher year-over-year across every Retail category. North American Retail fertilizer volumes in the fourth quarter were similar to last year, but there were significant regional differences. U.S. Retail fertilizer sales volumes in the fourth quarter were 20% higher year-over-year compared to the compressed season in 2018. Farmers in the corn bar -- belt, particularly the Eastern and Southern corn belt, were applying fertilizer right up until New Year's. However, this was fully offset by significantly lower volumes in Western Canada and some Northern U.S. states due to an early winter.\n\nWe had great success with the launch of our -- and adoption of our new digital platform in 2019. At the end of the year, we had customers representing over 60% of our North American revenue signed up. They made $260 million of purchases online in 2019, results that are unprecedented in the ag retail industry.\n\nPotash EBITDA was down 62% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower prices and sales volumes and higher per tonne cost as we took downtime at a number of our facilities to better match supply with a temporary reduction in global demand. The CN Rail strike also lowered earnings by approximately $10 million this quarter. On an annual basis, 2019 Potash adjusted EBITDA was similar to 2018, as higher average selling prices were offset by lower sales volumes.\n\nNitrogen EBITDA this quarter was 19% lower year-over-year due to lower ammonia volumes and sales prices. The narrow window for applying ammonia in Canada in the northern tier of the U.S. this fall had a major impact on our volumes and our earnings. We estimate we lost 110,000 tonnes of ammonia sales due to an early onset of winter in this very important market. As we have seen before, this will result in an increase in demand for Nitrogen product applications this spring. For the year, Nitrogen EBITDA increased 2%, as lower natural gas costs in North America and higher earnings from our equity investments more than offset lower ammonia sales volumes and lower nitrogen realized prices.\n\nDespite the pressed phosphate prices in the second half of 2019, our business continue to generate positive cash margins for both the quarter and the year, thanks to our product mix and merger synergies, including our decision to convert the Redwater phosphate facility to an ammonium sulfate facility.\n\nWhile fertilizer markets have started 2020 under pressure, there are several positive factors to consider for the crop input market as we look toward the spring season. This ag market should fully recover as we expect more than 14 million additional acres to be seeded this spring for about a 6% increase from last year. Almost all of those additional acres will be planted to corn and soybeans. A second positive development is the resolution of the U.S.-China trade dispute. While it is uncertain when we will see U.S. agricultural exports rise, there is little doubt it will be a significant improvement relative to the past two years.\n\nOn the market outlook for potash, we expect to see strong demand in North America, as our potash winter fill program achieved the target -- the targeted volumes quickly, and we were sold out of potash for the first quarter within a matter of weeks. Globally, we also expect that the dramatic increase in palm oil prices over the past three or four months, will result in a rebound in potash demand from Southeast Asia after imports dropped in that region by 2 million tonnes in 2019.\n\nHowever, we now expect China will not conclude a new contract until sometime in the second quarter due to elevated port inventories and the impact that the coronavirus is having on product movement in the country. As a result, we have lowered our 2020 Chinese fertilizer shipment estimate by 1 million tonnes from earlier estimates. Our new forecast for global potash demand in 2020 is 66 million tonnes to 68 million tonnes, which represents about a 4% increase over 2019 levels. As such, our sales plan this year is intended to support our customers in these growing markets with our sales anticipated to be between 12.3 million tonnes and 12.7 million tonnes.\n\nFor Nitrogen, we anticipate North American prices will be supported by a surge in demand this spring, and lower offshore imports. While this was a tough quarter for the industry, Nutrien stayed focus on our strategic priorities. We were excited to close the Ruralco acquisition and to announce the Australian rebranding uniting all of our global Retail operations under the name Nutrien Ag Solutions. We expect Ruralco and other acquisitions made in 2019 to add over $125 million to Retail EBITDA this year.\n\nWe also foresee strong organic growth for Retail, assuming normal weather and seeded acreage, plus the benefit from ongoing investments in our digital platform and supply chain improvements. We also announced the purchase of Agrosema, an ag retailer in Southern Brazil with 12 farm centers and 200 employees, servicing thousands of farm customers and we expect more of these types of acquisitions in Brazil in 2020. We will continue to focus on developing our leading position in digital agriculture. We are aiming to approach $0.5 billion in sales through the digital platform in North America this year, essentially doubling last year's level and leading the industry in online revenue generation.\n\nWe will also be rolling out our sustainable agriculture strategy supported by our climate smart investments. We have invested across the value chain and products, services and technologies that can make a significant and positive contribution to sustainable agriculture and to our bottom line. This will be a multi-pronged approach, including new ag, biological and nature-based products, best available carbon reduction technologies and carbon capture and sequestration both in our upstream and downstream operations. This also extends to our new digital tools that help growers make more informed decisions which encompasses our recent acquisitions of Agrible and Waypoint.\n\nWe will leverage these type of investments as we build a companywide sustainability strategy that is integrated into the long-term plans for our Company. We will be rolling out the details of this strategy along with specific targets later in 2020. We continue to believe our business model will perform well in times of volatility. Our strong cash generation will allow us to grow our operations while returning capital to shareholders with the focus clearly set on long-term value creation. We are issuing EBITDA guidance of $3.8 billion to $4.3 billion in 2020, which assumes a solid growth in Retail earnings, but recognizing that fertilizer prices are likely to continue to be under pressure in the first half of the year, given current levels and the lag in price realization compared to quoted benchmark prices.\n\nWe see 2020 as a year that will start to demonstrate the momentum back toward the path of recovery for global fertilizer markets, which started in 2018. We will continue to remain disciplined in our approach to capital to controlling our controllables, including our investment in production decisions.\n\nWith that, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jacob Bout with CIBC. Your line is open.\n\nJacob Bout -- CIBC -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. My question is on the same-store sales for Retail. So, I think for the year, you're indicating that it is down 1%, but if I remember correctly, you're -- on the third quarter call, you said year-to-date that same-store sales were up 1.5%. So wondering what happened in the fourth quarter? And then how does the same-store sales that you saw compared to the overall industry? And is there any nuances here within fertilizer seed and crop protection?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Good morning, Jacob. So that number is a global Retail number. I'll have Mike Frank just dissect it for you, because we've seen good growth in the U.S. and he can answer your question. So, go ahead, Mike.\n\nMichael J. Frank -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Retail\n\nYeah. Good morning, Jacob. So when we report on same-store sales, as you probably know, it's an adjusted number, so we adjust for both FX and for fertilizer price, which last year we had appreciation. And so on a global basis on the 12 months, we did see a 1% decline. If you look at the U.S. market, specifically, our same-store sales adjusted are up about 2%, so we actually had really strong performance in the U.S. We were down in Canada. As you may know, in Western Canada, we really lost the fourth quarter window for both herbicide application and fertilizer. And so that ended up hurting our same-store sales in Canada.\n\nAnd so that's kind of where we evolved from Q3 through to Q4.\n\nJacob Bout -- CIBC -- Analyst\n\nAnd then compared to the overall industry?\n\nMichael J. Frank -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Retail\n\nYeah. We don't have numbers, Jacob, for the industry. So the best numbers we have on an industry basis is in the U.S., again, which is our biggest market. We do get point-of-sale data on crop protection sales, so we have a really good understanding of the performance of our business in U.S. crop protection. And last year we saw an increase of about 1.5 share points, most of that being organic growth. And so we're really pleased with how our business performed in the U.S.\n\nAs you note, it was a very tight window. Once farmers eventually had a chance to plant their crop, our supply chain and service approach to our retail network really kicked in, and we saw significant share increase. And so I would expect, we led the way in same-store sales growth just based on that alone.\n\nJacob Bout -- CIBC -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJoel Jackson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nI thought maybe we could dive into your 2020 Potash guidance a little bit more. Maybe help me bridge for 2020. So are you assuming that you're getting some tailwinds here and maybe some lower-cost per tonne? Are you assuming lower royalties? I know that different credits that have been changing the government change some of the ability to apply them. It also seems like you're maybe assuming a $15 a tonne to $30 a tonne potash price increase globally from spot through the year. Can you maybe comment on the different buckets? Thanks.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Good morning, Joel. So I'll try to give you the best perspective that we have, if you look at our overall guidance, and then we can dive and have a deep look at the Potash business. The lower end of our guidance would essentially have today's pricing moving forward the year. We don't think that that is a high likelihood, but that is how we've crafted the overall lower end of the guidance. The upper end of the guidance has, of course, price increases assumed through the year, but that the overall net pricing would be actually less than 2019. So that's how we get to the upper end of the guidance.\n\nSo then when you look specifically at our Potash guidance, certainly when you look at how we've sold -- our sales plan, that's based on our view that we're going to see some decent growth moving up from 64.2 million tonnes, that's our estimate for 2019, up to 66 million tonnes to 68 million tonnes, and that's how we get our volume. So about 1 million tonnes of volume growth that we're assuming.\n\nAnd then when you look at our cash cost, we are assuming a slightly lower cash costs as we continue to optimize the Potash network grow volumes from Rocanville. So that's built into the guidance. And then the rest is really the market pricing which we sort of book end for you on a macro level from sort of today's pricing through to slightly less than last year's. We don't want to get too much more specific than that, because I think that's probably enough said. But we have some confidence in our guidance ranges.\n\nI think the biggest wild card that we have right now in Potash is when will the China contract be signed. And even that, I think, we've taken a fairly conservative route where we believe that the contract won't be settled now until the second quarter as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of the port inventory build, but really because of the disruption from the coronavirus and not being able to get to the negotiating table or as well as move port inventories inland. And we do think that that's going to have a bit of an impact into the second quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\n\nBen Isaacson -- Scotiabank -- Analyst\n\nThank you, and good morning. You mentioned some headwinds in your outlook or at least possible ones, the coronavirus, Australian drought, swine fever. Can you talk about what kind of puts and takes are on both in your business from each of those? And as it stands right now, how would you rank those in terms of importance to your bottom line? Thank you.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo look, I think the overall guidance ranges that we've set assumes normal weather. It does assume the 14 million acres of incremental seeded acreage in the U.S. that we've outlined. And so I think that you have to assume that the sales volumes that we've outlined in our guidance is key to the overall earnings. There is always a bunch of puts and takes in our industry, that's what agriculture is about. And I wouldn't want to overall rank them for you, because I don't think that that would be appropriate, and we wouldn't actually have a great understanding on which one is going to be most disruptive.\n\nI think given the situation in ag, when we look at last year versus this year, last year there was clearly geopolitical and the macro backdrop that pressured, not only in the Nutrien's earnings, but the entire sector. And the recovery of that we saw really nicely shaping up in 2018, there was a reset. And now that -- now we think that 2020 will be that year of recovery. But because of the situation of how low prices went in the fourth quarter and as well as the inventory that was build, some in Nitrogen, but also in Potash, we think that we're going to see the recovery in 2020, we just don't know when.\n\nThe coronavirus, just to give some commentary on that, obviously, we're watching it closely. Nobody really has, to the full impact, understood right now, but where we're seeing that impact is on the contract negotiation with Potash, which we've already talked about. But there is also some active ingredients for crop chemistry that are core to our supply chain, but many others that are quite tight right now.\n\nNow we have a very good inventory position for that. We don't think that that's going to impact us for the spring season. African swine fever, I think you mentioned that as well, we think that the worst is behind us there and that the herds are starting to rebuilt. Certainly, I think when you look at the results for 2019, you are going to see that grain and oilseed demand was impacted because of that. But that headwind should become a tailwind as we move through 2020.\n\nAnd then of course the U.S.-China trade settlement, a major headwind for the last two years, but now that the settlement is agreed to, I know that there is some uncertainty on when we're going to start to see U.S. agricultural products start to ship to China at the higher levels. But we have confidence that that will happen in 2020, we have confidence that that's going to be a major tailwind for us, but we don't know exactly the time. So that -- we're being a bit conservative because of all of these things. But most of the tailwinds from last year -- the headwinds from last year should become tailwinds for this year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.\n\nDon Carson -- Susquehanna Financial -- Analyst\n\nYes, thanks. Chuck, you got a difficult business environment these days with blockades and carbon tax, things like that. Can you talk about what the impact of the current rail situation is on your ability to move product to both the export and domestic points? And then what is the potential outlook for carbon taxes on your Alberta nitrogen production?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, Don. So look, on the CN Rail disruption here in Canada now, we do have some cars, some ammonia cars and some potash cars that are caught up in the slowdown. So the situation is manageable for us right now, it's far from ideal, but we don't spend a lot of cars East from our operations. So most of our production, as you know, is in the West, we don't use the East as a core exporting route. So the majority of our exports are going to be just fine.\n\nThis is disappointing though, because we just got through a rail strike at CN in the fourth quarter and now we've got this slowdown in Canada. And so overall, we're watching the situation. We don't think it's going to have an impact to our deliveries right now, but the reliability of the Canadian supply chain is becoming a concern for us. And that's something that we're actively involved with the authorities to try to help them understand that this will impact Canadian agriculture and our reputation over time if this stuff continues.\n\nThe carbon tax, we have a carbon tax already in Alberta and it's for large emitters, but we have also a lot of offsets as well. So we have a co-gen Facility at one of our operations that allows us to have a carbon tax credits and we also have a relatively new carbon sequestration operation that has been a fantastic investment for us and that is helping offset some of the carbon tax. So what I would say right now is that we are in the new regime, when it comes to carbon taxes certainly in Western Canada, it's something that's been with us for some time.\n\nI'd say today we don't see a significant impact to overall cost and we have found smart ways to offset our carbon taxes by making some, I think, strategic investments over time. And we'll watch the situation over time to see how things progress, but certainly right now, we're quite comfortable that the Canadian assets are going to remain very competitive globally and in fact with AECO gas related is [Phonetic] probably some of the lowest cost production on the planet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Andrew Wong with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Wong -- RBC -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning. So, I just like to understand how much excess free cash flow there might be this year. So we took the midpoint guidance, you applied some historical cash conversion, we get about $2 billion of cash flow -- free cash flow, about $1 billion of that goes to dividends. So out of the $1 billion that's remaining, how much of that has already kind of tagged for growth spending like acquisitions or growth capex, and then how much of that might be accessed available for share share buyback, stuff like that? Thanks.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, Andrew. I'll have Pedro, our CFO, answer your question, and I'll have some final comments as well.\n\nPedro Farah -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nAndrew, good morning. Our cash flow this year was particularly positive and I get surprised, but it's not a total surprise for those we're working here. We ended up last year pretty high in inventory. As you recall, we bought in anticipation of China tariffs last year. We also had a late season. And so, this year, we did a lot of work to work down the inventory. So, as we worked out this inventory, we produced very good cash flow, I think, in excess of course of earnings. And we think that that cash flow and working capital to continue to improve. Of course, there is going to be a lot of puts and takes, but we think that we -- the efforts we're putting this year will continue to bear fruits in this coming year.\n\nIn terms of our capital allocation, how much we're going to be using, for different uses. I mean our capital allocation strategy continues to be the same, so we'll -- after we protect the balance sheet and we spend in our sustaining capital to conserve our assets, we're going to be taking a look at everything and are complete for capital basis. We have a share buyback program active in January and February, and of course we're looking at our different alternatives for inorganic growth and organic, and we'll be making decisions throughout the year. But we think working capital continues to behave well.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, Andrew, just a few other comments. I think Pedro covered that very well. So, no change. We -- the Company was built to generate significant cash flow even in market conditions, like we saw last year. I think we've demonstrated that now and the priorities haven't changed, right? We want to maintain our investment-grade rating, we have a very strong balance sheet, we want to protect our assets, so from a sustaining capital perspective we allocate about $1 billion to put back into the assets to make sure that they're safe and reliable. And then beyond that, then it's a matter of allocating the capital for the best long-term growth for the shareholder. And we think that we'll have enough cash to do both, to return capital through buybacks and increase dividends over time, and to invest through both organic and inorganic investments for long-term value creation.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nLucas Beaumont -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\n\nHi guys. This is Lucas Beaumont on for Chris. So, I just wanted to go on to Retail. Could you give us an update on the ongoing opportunity to further consolidate the North American market, given some of the recent large transactions? Do you think there's still the potential for mid-sized to large acquisitions there, or should we be limiting our thought process to pretty much tuck-ins only at this point?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, Lucas. I'll have Mike Frank answer the question for you.\n\nMichael J. Frank -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Retail\n\nLucas, I think as we think about our opportunities in North America, they're primarily tuck-ins. You know if -- obviously if a significant our retail asset came on to the market, we would look at it, of course, but we're always focused on quality and value generation for our shareholders. And so, right now, we have, I think, a pretty solid lineup of tuck-in opportunities. Last year we acquired over 73 retail branches through our tuck-in program. And I would anticipate in 2020 we'll have something similar in the U.S. for opportunities as well.\n\nNow, as you may know, we're also looking at Brazil, so we announced an acquisition earlier this year of Agrosema and we continue to look for opportunities to really build out the backbone of our Retail business in Brazil. So we're also focused on opportunities in that market as well.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Hansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Hansen -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning guys. The target to double your digital sales in 2020 is notable. Can you perhaps describe if there is any changes to the platform over the course of the year that will help pull more farmers onto of the platform? And perhaps if it's not too early, just describe whether or not you're seeing any definitive market share benefits as a result of the platform? Thanks.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, Stevie. Yeah. We're very excited about the 2020 plan for our digital platform. Mike Frank will walk you through it.\n\nMichael J. Frank -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Retail\n\nSteve, so, we turned on our order taking capability on the platform a year ago, and we turned it on through the course of the first quarter and we saw a significant ramp-up of uptake of ordering online, finishing the year which is over $260 million of online orders. We -- in terms of changes to the platform, we continue to add more products onto the platform. Last year was primarily crop protection products. This year, we're adding seed ordering and fertilizer ordering capability onto the platform, so that will, I think, generate additional revenue. And we've also added a number of other features to the platform that we're turning on in 2020.\n\nWe recently turned on our crop planning tool, which allows our sales agronomist to sit down with our customers and plan their farm field by field across all inputs. It creates insights, both for our supply chain, but it also allows our sales agronomists to really work with our customers to provide those full acre solutions, including financing opportunities that we're now financing using Nutrien Financial, which is also integrated into the digital tools. So we're really creating a lot of convenience digital insights from an agronomy standpoint. We're also now exposing field-level weather and spring conditions.\n\nAnd so there is a number of features that we've added on to the platform at the last half of 2019 and here early in 2020. So our anticipation of doubling our online orders is, I think, very achievable and we've got a lot of momentum right now in that direction.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Byrne -- Bank of America -- Analyst\n\nYes, thank you. A fertilizer buyer in Brazil recently indicated that the potash sales in the Brazil in recent months were sold only with a price cap and that the buyers were given 60 days to lock in the price, which, if this was a practice that was prevalent, certainly could have contributed to the plunge in pricing in that region. Can you comment on this? Was Canpotex involved in the selling practice? And if so, do you expect that to continue after the potash market tightens up?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Good morning, Steve. I'll have Ken Seitz, our Head of the Potash business, answer your question.\n\nKen Seitz -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Potash\n\nThanks, Steve. Yes, I can say that we have seen some smaller volumes moving in Brazil with different pricing mechanisms. But I can also tell you that for the large volumes and the large suppliers, it's not the case, and certainly not the case for Canpotex. Canpotex says they're very well established channels into that country. And you can see the prices that $245 a tonne, $250 a tonne, with various rebates depending on volume, but it's not the case. The Canpotex is looking at untraditional pricing mechanisms with their customers into Brazil.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nAdam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nYes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to just get a little bit more color on the potash market outlook for 2020. So, at the market level, it looks like you're forecasting about 2.5 million tonne kind of increase in global shipments at midpoint. Your sales forecast calls for about 1 million tonne increase in sales. And if I'm thinking about kind of as new entrants in the market, we would think that there should probably be about 750 million to 1 million more tonnes of EuroChem production incremental year-on-year. Given that, do you think that -- and all the curtailments that took place in the industry in the fourth quarter of 2019, do you think that that's actually -- kind of there is enough room for everybody else to see you a reasonable recovery in normalization of production or do you think that there is more capacity that has to primarily come upstream to balance the market?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Good morning, Adam. So I'll just give you a high-level perspective on your question here. Certainly, the setback last year when we had a reduction because of palm oil prices and then of course the U.S. weather impacted, before that we were seeing very good growth, and we had a view that as the market continue to grow at its historical rate, it would require more supply and the new entrants supply would fit pretty nicely into demand. Obviously, in 2019, we had the reset, and I think Nutrien looked at our sales book and we pulled back on our sales, because simply we didn't have the customer base to support it.\n\nNow when we look at the 2020 plan, now we're seeing, what I would call, a respectable growth, another 4% up from 2019 levels getting back to basically 2018 levels. And so our plan is outlined in my prepared remarks. We are going to take our sales volumes up and we think that it will be supported by growth in Southeast Asia and in North America. China is probably going to take a little less than they took last year.\n\nBut overall, when we look at the sales plan that we've put forth, we think that the market is going to need the tonnes. And we're not sure exactly what others are planning or could do, but certainly with the increased market that we see coming in 2020, depending on when we see a channel settlement, our view strongly is that our sales plan makes a lot of sense for us and for our stakeholders. And then we'll just have to see how the rest of the market moves their tonnes into it. We don't really have a lot of insight on their sales plan.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nThank you. At your Investor Day last year, you identified some nitrogen brownfield opportunities, both near term and a little bit longer term. Could you give us an update on where your thoughts are on that?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Good morning. I'll have Raef Sully just walk you through the progress.\n\nRaef Sully -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Nitrogen and Phosphate\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, John. At the Investor Day, we identified about $300 million of spend on about five or six projects. And the first wave of those is actually coming online this year. So if you look at our forecast volumes, we're expecting to see that 1 million tonnes more product sale in 2020 versus 2019. Some of that is ammonium sulfate, about 400,000 tonnes there. The 700,000 tonnes is mix of ammonia and urea. Some of that of course is from less unplanned -- less planned outages. Some of it is the first wave of these expansion projects. We have some other projects coming online in '20. We should be finished our Borger expansions and also the Augusta urea plant. And so we'll see continued growth in volumes through '20 and then into 2021.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nP.J. Juvekar -- Citi -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hi, Chuck. You mentioned you're -- that lower raw material cost in phosphates would be a headwind to a significant market recovery. Are you saying that phosphate prices are unlikely to go up due to lower raw materials? And what's your margin outlook? Thank you.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, P.J. I'll have Raef Sully answer the questions for you.\n\nRaef Sully -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Nitrogen and Phosphate\n\nSo, P.J., we think -- as you know, there is a lot of price decline through 2019 in phosphates. We saw ICP and other producers pulled back from the U.S. market. We've seen prices come up a little bit. We suspect that they will probably come up a little bit further before the importers get back into the market in a big way. We don't think there'll be a large price appreciation, we think there'll be some. But the only thing I'll add, P.J., is that when you look at our phosphate business, you got to remember that most of the margin these days comes from non-agricultural products that we sell, including our purified industrial products.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. And, P.J., one last point is just, we did lower our total cost because we converted Redwater to an ammonium sulfate plant. We did some modest expansions of our two phosphate facilities in the U.S. and of course we're not buying imported rock anymore for Redwater. So overall, that's what's driven our cost. And even in these tough conditions we saw in '19, we did have positive margins. And as Raef said, and most of our product mix is not related to agriculture, it's related to Industrial business and food applications, which I think has a more stable margins over the long term. So those two combinations, when we look at our business, it helps a lot and it insulates us a little bit more than from the kind of the agricultural backdrop that we saw in 2018 and 2019.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.\n\nMark Connelly -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Two questions. Was all of the increase in ammonia controllable cost related to the turnarounds? And secondly, some farmers in the Midwest are telling us that soil moisture is too hard, too high, and I'm wondering in the middle of February, whether that's a concern yet? But if they do stay too high, how is that going to affect your mix and timing in Nitrogen?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, Mark. I'll have Raef Sully answer the first question, and then Mike can give you a view of moisture levels in the U.S., and then Raef can come back and talk about the impact.\n\nRaef Sully -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Nitrogen and Phosphate\n\nYeah. So look, I mean, there's certainly been -- I mentioned the expansion projects previously. There's been a mix of those plus efficiency work going on with the large turnarounds we've been doing. So, we certainly have been focusing on efficiency. I think that the majority of the cost would come from lower gas costs year-over-year. We're seeing that in the U.S. Sorry, what was the...\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, then, I think let Raef answer [Indecipherable] early. Mike will answer the question on soil moisture conditions.\n\nMichael J. Frank -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Retail\n\nGood morning, Mark. So the way we look at the U.S. right now from a Midwest standpoint, if you go south of I-80, I would say soil moisture is good, but not excessive. And as we talk to our customers throughout that region, they are anticipating getting in the field once it warms up. And for the most part, it's been a pretty mild winter through a lot of that region. If you go north of I-80 into the Dakotas and Minnesota, Wisconsin, obviously, they had a really, early winter hit them. Soil moist moisture, especially in South Dakota, are still high, but the ground is frozen. And so even though they've had solid snow conditions, the moisture hasn't been added to, I think, over the winter.\n\nSo look, we're anticipating as we've talked about another 14 more million acres getting planted in 2020 and a lot of that over 12 million acres of that is corn and beans that are going to go in the Midwest. And so that's our anticipation. And as we talk to our customers right now, when we look at our order book, our order book for corn seed is incredibly strong, where we're seeing a lot of momentum in corn. And I would say the bean -- soybean order book is consistent with our expectation of about 85 million acres of soybeans right now. So that's what farmers are planning on and anticipating. And obviously, we need a normal spring conditions in order for us to get those acres planted.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd, Mark, just to wrap up with your last point, it's -- we don't have any concerns right now on fertilizer applications for the spring season, because of the weather or moisture conditions. It's a little too early to be concerned right now and things looked like they're proceeding as we would have expected them to.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJeremy Rosenberg -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nHi. This is Jeremy Rosenberg on for Vincent. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the potash outlook, looks like versus prior guidance, it took a India number down, maybe about 450,000 tonnes at the midpoint, Latin America down about 800,000 tonnes, and other Asia looks basically unchanged. So just two quick ones. One is just what drove the changes to the India and Latin America shipment numbers? And two, just given the decline in palm oil prices over the last, call it, month or so, if you just see any risk to the other Asia demand number? Thank you.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. I'll have Jason Newton, our Chief Economist, answer your questions.\n\nJason Newton -- Chief Economist & Head of Market Research\n\nHey. Good morning, Jeremy. On India, the major driver -- I mean, we still expect year-over-year that we'll see shipments going into India, possible 500,000 tonnes. We ended up last year right around where expect about 4.1 million tonnes. But we think there is some risk of subsea change in India as a result of lower prices, and we'll watch that going forward. We do expect India to move up.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, we expect demand will be up about 1.5 million tonnes, and yet palm oil prices have been really volatile and that's related to the coronavirus. And -- but as we look at what the USDA and others are saying in terms of the supply/demand outlook, it is tightening significantly. And so we think prices will be supportive as a result of that, and they're still up about 40% from the low of last year. And so we expect a rebound in that region, although not back up to 2018 levels.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Piken -- Cleveland Research -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. Just wanted to get a feel for how your retail margins might look this year and what are your expectations are if we can kind of look at it from a crop nutrient standpoint as well as from seed and crop protection in light of maybe some additional rebating discounting going on in the seed markets and in the case of fertilizer some of these prices, particularly UAN and phosphate may be below where pricing was during fill levels? Thanks.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. Mike Frank can answer the question.\n\nMichael J. Frank -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Retail\n\nYeah. Michael, look if we kind of go through the major categories and from a margin standpoint as we head into 2020, firstly, from a nutrient standpoint, we were pleased with the performance of our nutrient business last year. Our margin per tonnes were up $6 a tonne across our global Retail business. In Q4 and early days here in 2020, we're seeing those margins hold. And so we anticipate similar margins on a per tonne basis in 2020 that we delivered in 2019. On CPs, we had a very challenging first half of the year in CP. There was a lot of inventory that was carried into the -- into early 2019 across the retail network.\n\nAnd then the market was really slow to evolve and that put a lot of margin pressure. And of course, as we reported our first half earnings last year, it was reflected in our margins in crop protection. As we -- as the year unfolded, we really recovered significantly and we ended up holding our margins -- our gross margins pretty flat year-over-year. And so as we head into 2020, I would actually anticipate some positive opportunities on our crop protection margins. We don't anticipate the delayed spring. I think channel inventories, including our own, have drawn down at this time this year versus this time last year, and that should all be conducive to more regular levels of competition and opportunities for us from a margin standpoint.\n\nWe also saw -- just on the crop protection, before I leave that, we also saw a little bit of a decline in our mix of proprietary products last year. And again a lot of that was based on inventories that we had that we wanted to sell the inventories that we had in our sheds. And so as we look at 2020, we would anticipate our mix of proprietary products to get back to where we were a year earlier and that will also be constructive to margins.\n\nFinally, on the seed side, we are seeing to date, margins on corn seed at pretty historic levels. And so -- and with more corn acres to be planted, that's going to be good for our seed margins. Soybean seed is probably where there is more competition this year. And so we're seeing a bit of margin erosion in our soybean seed business. So, I would say that's probably the one area that we're watching out for. But overall, I think if you look at seed on an all-in basis, we'll likely be in similar margins as we've been historically, especially with more corn acres coming in.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nJonas Oxgaard -- Bernstein -- Analyst\n\nHi, good morning. So, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your Brazil acquisition strategy and how the integration of the previous acquisition is going. Are we seeing any synergies out of that so far?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, Jonas. Yeah. So Mike Frank can answer the question.\n\nMichael J. Frank -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Retail\n\nSo, Jonas, as we build out our retail business in Brazil, in the early days, there's not the traditional synergies that we get in North America or even in Australia, because we have a big footprint that we tuck-in the acquisitions into. As we build out our retail footprint in Brazil, primarily we're expanding into new geographies. And so there is not significant synergies from a proprietary product standpoint or from an operational leverage standpoint. That being said, about 18 months ago, we acquired a nutritional business in Australia called Agrichem. And so as we expand our footprint in Brazil, our retail footprint, we do see that as a channel to increase our sales of Agrochem products, which are industry-leading nutritional products that come with really nice margins and customer benefits.\n\nAnd so that would be the one area of synergy, but again just to set expectations as we think about Brazil, we're really building out the backbone and the capability of our retail network, and that will likely take the next two years or three years. And from that point, as we get that business established, as we tuck-in from that point going forward, we'll see more synergies.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Zekauskas -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\n\nThanks very much. In Europe, potash data, you show that Canpotex shipped about 17% of its volume to China in the quarter. Are those shipments priced at the old $2.90 [Phonetic] per tonne delivered that the old China contract to us under, or is there a different set of prices that are used now? And secondly, Chuck, I think you said that acquisitions would benefit Retail EBITDA by $125 million in 2020. How much did they benefit Retail EBITDA in 2019?\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Good morning, Jeff. So I'll have Ken Seitz answer the potash question and then we can come back and answer the M&A question for Retail.\n\nJeff Zekauskas -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\n\nYeah.\n\nKen Seitz -- Executive Vice President and CEO of Potash\n\nRight. So, yeah, with respect to fourth quarter shipments into China, we positioned potash along our entire supply chain in any point in the year, and that's also true for China. And so the volumes that you would have seen go to China would have been provisionally shipped there and headed into bonded warehouses. As you probably know, China stopped additional shipments into that country, sea imports, at the end of August, yet Canpotex shipped in pre-position material and in anticipation of strong demand in China in 2020.\n\nAnd so the pricing mechanism for those provisionally shipped volumes will be that they are awaiting a new contract, which is relevant, because in fact Canpotex is not the only supplier, so that when we look at port inventories in China and say 3.5 million tonnes, well about 1.5 million -- 1 million of those tonnes now are awaiting a new contract. And that new contract price will be the price for those provisionally shipped volumes.\n\nCharles Magro -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd then, Jeff, just to answer your second question. So the impact from M&A for -- on 2019 was somewhere between $35 million and $40 million. As you know, we didn't close Ruralco until October. And so that was really the driving difference, I think, between 2019 and 2020, as well as we have several of the other tuck-ins that will start to show benefit in 2020. So to answer your question, somewhere between $35 million and $40 million.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd there are no further questions queued up at this time.

            "content": "Brussels (AFP) - EU leaders are to hold a Brussels summit Thursday to set a seven-year budget despite splits between some stingy rich nations, poorer ones wanting to preserve spending and others wanting to fund grand global ambitions.\n\nThe money tussle, hard-fought at the best of times, is especially problematic this time around because of Britain's departure from the EU. The \"Brexit gap\" caused by the loss of the UK's contribution is 75 billion euros ($81 billion) over the 2021-2027 period.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on the eve of the summit predicted \"very tough and difficult negotiations\" around the table.\n\nThe talks are expected to be so strained that some of the 27 EU delegations are preparing for the summit to drag out into the weekend.\n\nA few EU sources, however, suggested differences over the budget are so great the summit could end quickly and the can kicked down the road to another summit -- or two -- in the coming months.\n\nAn analyst at the European Policy Centre, Marta Pilati, agreed, saying: \"There likely won't be agreement at this summit. All the member states aren't showing much willingness to compromise.\"\n\nThe minimum spending in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), as the long-term budget is called, is just over one trillion euros.\n\n- Varied goals -\n\nThe discord is over how much above that amount this budget should be, how spending might be shifted between priorities and how much each member state should pay as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nAnother touchy issue is whether budget rebates pocketed by a few wealthier countries should still exist.\n\nThe last MFF came in at 1.08 trillion euros (in 2018 prices).\n\nA \"frugal four\" group of nations -- Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden -- wants to rein in the budget and make up only some of the ground of the Brexit gap.\n\nThey also want to keep their rebates, as does Germany.\n\nAt the high end of spending demands is the European Parliament, which wants the MFF expanded to 1.32 trillion euros to pay for costly goals such as turning the European Union into a carbon-neutral economy within three decades.\n\nThe legislature, which has to sign off on the final MFF, believes more money can be raised from EU-wide taxes on plastics and on the carbon emissions trading scheme.\n\nA \"friends of cohesion\" group of mostly eastern and southern EU nations wants to ringfence money it gets to help bring infrastructure and society up to the level of wealthier counterparts.\n\nAgriculturally sensitive countries such as France, Spain and Poland are also looking to preserve farmers' subsidies. France would like to also see extra money for common security and defence and the \"unfair\" rebates scrapped.\n\nThe European Commission, which aims for a \"geopolitical\" mantle under President Ursula von der Leyen, is trying for a target of 1.13 trillion euros.\n\n- Looking for a deal -\n\nThe president of the European Council, Charles Michel, who calls and coordinates summits, believes he can at least narrow positions.\n\nHis MFF proposal is 1.09 trillion euros and makes cuts to cohesion funds and farm subsidies to finance other priority areas.\n\nA senior EU official said Michel's plan would re-allocate \"about eight billion euros from richer to poorer member states\".\n\nHis plan, though, has little support.\n\nThe European Parliament has rejected it as too little. Germany says it is a \"step backwards\" and Spain has criticised it for \"not recognising the role of agriculture\" in EU cohesion.\n\nBut the senior EU official said Michel believes the splits will not change over the coming months and he \"is very determined to clinch a deal in the coming days.\""

The announcement was made at an occasion of Soil Health Card Day. Soil Health Card Day was celebrated all over India on February 19, 2020.\n\nHighlights\n\nGovernment of India is to increase oil seed production in order to make the country self-reliant in oil seed production.\n\nThe Minister also announced that GoI is to create 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations all over the country. In order to support this, the GoI is to provide Rs 6,000 rupees.\n\nCurrent Oil Seed Scenario in India\n\nIndia is the fourth largest vegetable oil economy in the world after USA, China and Brazil. Today, the oil seeds account for 13% of cropped area in the country.\n\nThe National Mission on Oil Seeds and Oil Palm was launched by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare. The scheme was to be implemented for 5 years between 2014-15 and 2018-19.\n\nIndia-Malaysia\n\nRecently, there has been major rifts between India and Malaysia over Palm oil. Malaysia at the United Nations General Assembly meet placed open accusations on India for abrogating Article 370 and its other steps towards development of Kashmir. Malaysian PM accused India of invading and occupying Kashmir. According to India, Kashmir issue is completely internal and is between India and Pakistan to settle upon.\n\nFollowing such accusations, India gradually decreased its Palm oil imports from Malaysia. In September 2019, the palm oil imports (before the Malaysian PM’s accusation) were 310,648 tonnes. In October, the imports were reduced to 219,956 tonnes and in November it was 142,696 tonnes.\n\nIndia is the largest importer of palm oil in the world. And oil exports are highly important for the Malaysian economy as it accounts to 2.8% of its GDP and 4.5% of its total exports.\n\nInference\n\nIndia having cut its imports from Malaysia, is now on the plan of increasing its domestic oil seed production.\n\nGet these updates on Current Affairs Today Android App\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonth:Current Affairs – February, 2020\n\nCategories: Government Schemes in India\n\nTags: Agricultural Commodities • Agriculture • Article 370 • India-Malaysia • Oilseeds\n\n"

He died Monday.\n\nIn California has your daily news, features and interviews from across USA TODAY Network newsrooms and beyond. Click here to get this straight to your inbox.\n\nThe state's actual first Asian American sheriff. Probably\n\nTimothy Saxon, born in Japan, is the sheriff of Trinity County. More\n\nWhen Paul Miyamoto won election last fall as San Francisco sheriff and again at his January swearing-in, there was lots of buzz about him being the first Asian American sheriff in state history.\n\nBut a subsequent USA TODAY profile of Miyamoto, which posted on Feb. 16, has led to a historical revelation. The first Asian American sheriff appears to be Sheriff Timothy Saxon of Trinity County, a mostly rural slice of wooded paradise with 13,000 residents.\n\nSaxon's life story begins with his birth in Japan and immediate adoption by an Anglo-heritage Air Force official and his wife, who a few years later moved back to the United States. \"Bottom line is, I'm American,\" says Saxon. \"I was raised American, and my parents never treated me as anything but American.\"\n\nMiyamoto said Tuesday he was \"delighted that I’m not the first Asian American sheriff in California. It tells me we’re making progress diversifying leadership positions in law enforcement.\"\n\nDACA, a deadly library fire and a beach camping ban\n\nJefferey Noon has spent most nights at Hueneme Beach over the past few months. Port Hueneme is considering a ban on camping and sleeping overnight at the beach. More\n\nDACA recipients could pay significantly more to maintain their legal status under a proposal the Trump administration is floating to raise the every-other-year renewal fee from $495 to $765 — a 55% increase.\n\nThe mood was somber Wednesday in Porterville, where two firefighters are believed to have died fighting a blaze at the library. Two teen boys were arrested and booked on suspicion of arson and manslaughter.\n\nThis city wants to ban sleeping and camping on the beach but it has no shelter. See how Port Hueneme plans to go around a ruling that says you can't punish people for sleeping on public property unless there are low-barrier options for them to go (story is for subscribers only).\n\nHomelessness 'a disgrace,' Newsom says\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom spoke to the press at the end of his statewide homelessness tour, in Oakland, Calif. More\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom dedicated his entire State of the State speech to one problem vexing the state: homelessness.\n\n\"Let's call it what it is, a disgrace, that the richest state in the richest nation, succeeding across so many sectors, is failing to properly house, heal and humanely treat so many of its own people,\" Newsom said.\n\nAmong a variety of proposals highlighted in the governor's speech on Wednesday, Newsom said he would deploy trailers for the homeless to half a dozen counties, reduce street homelessness through emergency actions, and help homeless people who are mentally ill get the help they need."

            "content": "ISLAMABAD: Besides taking up key national issues, the federal cabinet may discuss the “mysterious escape” of former spokesman for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Ehsanullah Ehsan from the custody of security agencies at its meeting on Thursday (today).\n\nThis was hinted by federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari during an exclusive chat with DawnNews on Thursday.\n\nIn reply to a question about reports of former TTP leader’s escape, Dr Mazari said though the issue did not fall in her ministry’s purview, “it will be raised and discussed in the Thursday’s meeting of the federal cabinet”.\n\nThe human rights minister said the issue of Ehsan’s escape basically fell in the purview of the Ministry of Interior and other security institutions. She, however, said there must be a strict security around the detained terrorists. Moreover, she said, there should be early convictions of terrorists facing trials.\n\nDuring an informal conversation with journalists at the Parliament House on Monday, Interior Minister Ijaz Shah had for the first time confirmed reports that Ehsanullah Ehsan had escaped from the custody of security agencies.\n\nThe minister in a casual way stated that he had read reports about the former TTP leader’s escape. When asked whether there was any truth in such reports, he replied: “The news is true, it’s true.”\n\nThe minister said the state was aware of Ehsan’s escape, but did not provide details.\n\nWhen asked what the state was doing on the matter, he said: “A lot is being done. You will hear a good news.”\n\nThe opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had last week rai­­­sed the issue of Ehsanullah Eh­­san’s escape in the National Assembly and Senate, respectively, and sought a response from the government.\n\nThe opposition parties had also demanded the matter to be referred to a parliamentary committee for investigation. However, despite presence of a number of ministers in the sessions of both the houses of parliament, no response came from the treasury benches on the issue.\n\nLater, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also raised the issue during a news conference in Islamabad and questioned the government’s silence on the issue. He said the escape was a proof of the government’s “incompetence and failure”.\n\nThe Senate Standing Committee on Interior has already sought a report from the interior ministry on the escape.\n\nMr Bhutto-Zardari had also submitted a question to the National Assembly Secretariat, seeking the interior minister’s response to the issue on the floor of the house.\n\nEarlier this month, the former TTP spokesman in a call to a Pakistani newspaper had claimed that he was in Turkey, along with his wife, son and daughter, but refused to say how he managed to reach there.\n\nEhsan’s escape was first reported by an Indian weekly newspaper on Jan 18 — barely a week after his escape. The report quoted “Pakistan-based sources” as saying that he had fled his ‘safe house’ where he was being kept along with his family.\n\nLater, a short audio message purportedly recorded and released by Ehsan surfaced on social media. In the message, he disclosed that he had on Jan 11 managed to escape from the “custody of the Pakistani security authorities”.\n\nEhsan, whose real name is Liaquat Ali, said he had surrendered to a Pakistani security agency on Feb 5, 2017, under an agreement. He claimed that he had honoured his part of the agreement, but alleged that the Pakistani authorities had violated its terms and kept him in a prison along with his family.\n\nEhsan had claimed responsibility for the horrific attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar which left more than 140 people, most of them children, dead in December 2014.\n\nCabinet agenda\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat already issued a 12-point agenda for Thurs­day’s meeting of the federal cabinet.\n\nAccording to the agenda, the cabinet will consider giving “one time permission for import of insecticides from India” to fight ongoing locust attack on the country’s agriculture. The trade with India has been under suspension for more than seven months after New Delhi’s act of forcefully annexing occupied Kashmir in August last year.\n\nThe cabinet will also deliberate on gas pricing and power bills to comply with requirements of the Interna­tional Monetary Fund for disbursement of next tranche of $450 million.\n\nThe adviser to the prime minister on finance & revenue would also give a detailed presentation on regulatory duties and taxes on pulses in view of rising prices of essential food items.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 20th, 2020"

These will be made operational from Kharif 2020. ET was the first to report such changes were being planned. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said central subsidy will be limited for premium rates up to 30% for unirrigated areas and 25% for irrigated areas. The allocation of business to insurance companies will now be done for three years instead of a yearly tender.“Central share in premium subsidy will be increased to 90% for north-eastern states from the existing sharing pattern of 50:50,” said Tomar. He said the government has created a budgetary provision of Rs 4,496 crore to form and promote 10,000 new FPOs under the new central sector scheme, Formation and Promotion of Farmer Producer Organisations.Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said the proposal approved for dairies will help 9.5 million dairy farmers. The activities include modernisation of new milk processing facilities and manufacturing facilities for value added products, chilling infrastructure, electronic adulteration testing kit, project management and learning. Under the scheme, 28,000 bulk milk coolers will be established with 14 million litres per day as additional milk chilling capacity. Milk drying capacity will be increased to 210 metric tonnes per day and 28,000 milk testing equipment will be provided to check adulteration."

You have tremendous amounts of water.\"\n\nA major obstacle to providing water for the region's farmers has now been totally eliminated by the federal government, Trump said Wednesday in Bakersfield, Calif., flanked by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), as well as Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who helped shepherd the changes to the states water policy.

            "content": "Desert locusts have been ravaging East Africa. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization warns of a food crisis. The main response has been spraying the areas affected with pesticides. But more needs to be done.\n\nBernard Makanga's farm was invaded by desert locusts. \"Normally by this time, these beans, they're ready for harvest. But the locusts have destroyed them all,\" he told DW. His neighbor Francis Muliungi's crop is equally devastated. \"There is nothing left to harvest. And there is nothing else that I know how to do. It's just this farm. That's where I get food, where I feed my family and friends, all people,\" he said.\n\nThis is the worst infestation that Kenya has seen in 70 years. Many farmers in the affected regions have lost their crops. Some have started planting again, but they don't know what they will do if the locusts return, which at this point looks very likely, according to environmental experts.\n\nA second generation of the insects is already threatening to swarm Kenya and other parts of the region, including Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan.\n\nMore conflicts\n\nThe locusts are putting extra stress on regions already battling problems such as food insecurity and armed conflicts, raising the specter of more violence to come. Tobias Takavarasha, representative in Kenya of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said: \"That danger exists, to the extent that there is a risk wherever there are shortages of food.\" He added that the situation could degenerate into conflict \"if that is not taken care of.\"\n\nThe Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation reported that the locust invasion in Samburu is \"threatening to trigger conflicts over grazing fields among pastoralist communities.\" In rural Somalia, 50% of the people depend on animals for their livelihood. And in South Sudan 6 million people were already suffering food shortages before the locusts arrived. Experts believe that South Sudan is particularly ill-prepared to deal with the invasion.\n\nSpraying the locusts\n\nInternational agencies are scrambling to contain the swarms, mainly by spraying pesticides. Critics say that this can be just as dangerous as the plague itself in the long run, as the poison is liable to enter the food chain and also kill other insects besides locusts. \"This is where we have experts to assure that the pesticides that are procured to spray the locusts are the correct ones, that they are internationally approved and registered, and that they are effective,\" Takavarasha said.\n\nThe FAO representative said there were three levels of preparedness, including ensuring the availability of food and equipping farmers to enable them to start planting again when the season comes. The first level, though, is \"the capacity to control the invasion of the locusts,\" Takavarasha said. \"That includes accessing where the locusts have been sighted.\"\n\nFunds needed\n\nAccess remains a problem. Some points of origin are located in crisis hot spots such as Somalia. Large parts of the country are under threat, or controlled by al-Shabab. The international community is trying to negotiate access with the extremist group.\n\nA 1-square-kilometer (0.4-square-mile) swarm can eat as much food in one day as 35,000 people. Locusts can also travel up to 200 kilometers (120 miles) per day. And they reproduce very quickly. The response needs to be just as quick, something that has yet to be understood by the international community. Dominique Burgeon, director of the FAO's Emergency and Rehabilitation Division, told DW that there is an appeal out for $76 million (€70 million), but so far the organization has received only $30 million. \"We have a very short window of opportunity,\" Burgeon said. \"We are in between two planting seasons. We need to control the locust population now, before the planting season starts in March/April. This is the main planting season.\"\n\nThe climate factor\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines East Africa Food and Agriculture By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Niklas Hagelberg, senior program coordinator at the UN Environment Programme, told DW that scientific data did not yet directly link the current events with climate change, even if he \"personally\" believes in the possibility. \"What we can say is that the likelihood for increasing rainfall, increasing heat, increasing winds, has gone up due to climate change,\" Hagelberg said. \"So the likelihood for a swarm like this has increased.\"\n\nSpraying with pesticides is an emergency measure. In future, other steps need to be taken to improve the response to similar outbreaks. \"I think a key element from a climate change point of view is that we have early warning systems,\" Hagelberg said. \"Because the system is changing, we need to get early warnings on conditions for the formation of swarms as early as possible, which would make a timely and concerted international reaction possible.\"\n\nSella Oneko (Nairobi) contributed to this article"

Now, the publication of a new immigration strategy has some people up in arms at the prospect of reform.\n\nRead more: EU immigration proposals ‘disastrous’ for hospitality industry\n\nBut with the UK leaving the EU it is a matter of legal necessity that we devise a new immigration system — since freedom of movement will come to an end. Labour MPs, currently indulging in arguments about abolishing the monarchy or whether gender exists, took a break from their leadership contest to denounce the new policy as racist. Given the explicit aim is to treat everyone equally no matter their country of origin, this seemed a daft line of attack — not least since the government’s proposals do raise some serious concerns.\n\nBut first, the good news: this isn’t Theresa May’s immigration policy. May clung to the ludicrous target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. Home secretary Priti Patel yesterday stressed that the government had no interest whatsoever in a target, though she did say a consequence of the reforms would be a fall in the numbers.\n\nTo put it crudely, she wants to focus on quality, not quantity. And so to the policy itself. Under the new system a migrant worker will need 70 points to qualify, with points awarded for speaking English, having a job offer, fitting the salary bracket, working in a designated occupation, etc. The rules will apply to everyone whether EU national, Indian or Australian. There is a renewed focus on attracting high-skilled migrants, with a new global talent visa having no cap on numbers. That means competition for roles in science, technology and engineering is about to heat up.\n\nBroadly speaking, there is much to welcome here, but it’s the change to so-called low-skill migration that will have the most immediate impact — particularly in the capital. Hospitality and construction employers’ groups have already sounded the alarm, but much will hinge on the government’s designation of sectors facing a shortage or workers. Agriculture and Indian restaurants have already been granted special status, so in theory there’s no reason why restaurants and retail couldn’t be added to the list.\n\nRead more: EU immigration proposals bad for London, says mayoral candidate Rory Stewart\n\nIt is possible that, over time, a shortage of labour sees wages rise to a point where roles become more attractive to domestic workers, but this won’t happen overnight and so the government must continue to listen to industry and the pressing needs of key sectors."

Gavin Newsom to Democratic presidential primary hopeful and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg.\n\n“For too long water authorities have flushed millions of gallons into the Pacific,” Trump said. “I ordered the administration to update outdated opinions which determined water allocation in this state.”\n\nTrump added that he is going “to put a lot of pressure” on Newsom to enact the changes and if the California governor doesn’t follow through then “you’ll get a new governor.”\n\nTRUMP AND BLOOMBERG SPAR ON TWITTER AHEAD OF DEBATE\n\nTrump has long criticized the environmental rules governing the flow of water in California – calling the rules “insane” during a campaign stop in 2016 and pledging that he’d be “opening up the water” for farmers.\n\nThe environmental rules are meant to ensure that enough water stayed in rivers and the San Francisco Bay to sustain more than a dozen endangered fish and other native species, which are struggling as agriculture and development diverts more water and land from wildlife.\n\nEnvironmental advocates and the state say the changes will allow federal authorities to pump more water from California's wetter north southward to its biggest cities and farms.\n\nThe Trump administration, Republican lawmakers and farm and water agencies say the changes will allow for more flexibility in water deliveries. In California's heavily engineered water system, giant state and federal water projects made up of hundreds of miles of pipes, canals, pumps and dams, carry runoff from rain and Sierra Nevada snow melt from north to south — and serve as field of battle for lawsuits and regional political fights over competing demands for water.\n\nEnvironmental groups say the changes will speed the disappearance of endangered winter-run salmon and other native fish and make life tougher for whales and other creatures in the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean.\n\nAfter an initial study by federal scientists found the rule changes would harm salmon and whales, the Trump administration ordered a new round of review, California news organizations reported last year.\n\nThe overall effort “ensured the highest quality\" of evaluation of the rule changes, Paul Souza, Pacific Southwest director for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\n“We strongly disagree that the proposal will reduce protections for endangered species,\" Souza said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBeyond operational changes in the federal Central Valley Project water system, the administration's changes allow for more habitat restoration, upgrades in fish hatcheries and the water system itself, monitoring of species and other improvements, Souza said.\n\nConservation groups have promised new rounds of lawsuits to try to block the redone environmental rules.\n\n“The species really are in much worse shape” than in earlier years, Doug Obegi with the Natural Resources Defense Council said. “We are at the point where we may watch them wink out ... potentially in the next few years.”\n\nFox News' Morgan Phillips and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Probably\n\nWhen Paul Miyamoto won election last fall as San Francisco sheriff and again at his January swearing-in, there was lots of buzz about him being the first Asian American sheriff in state history.\n\nBut a subsequent USA TODAY profile of Miyamoto, which posted on Feb. 16, has led to a historical revelation. The first Asian American sheriff appears to be Sheriff Timothy Saxon of Trinity County, a mostly rural slice of wooded paradise with 13,000 residents.\n\nSaxon's life story begins with his birth in Japan and immediate adoption by an Anglo-heritage Air Force official and his wife, who a few years later moved back to the United States. \"Bottom line is, I'm American,\" says Saxon. \"I was raised American, and my parents never treated me as anything but American.\"\n\nMiyamoto said Tuesday he was \"delighted that I’m not the first Asian American sheriff in California. It tells me we’re making progress diversifying leadership positions in law enforcement.\"\n\nDACA, a deadly library fire and a beach camping ban\n\nDACA recipients could pay significantly more to maintain their legal status under a proposal the Trump administration is floating to raise the every-other-year renewal fee from $495 to $765 — a 55% increase.\n\nThe mood was somber Wednesday in Porterville, where two firefighters are believed to have died fighting a blaze at the library. Two teen boys were arrested and booked on suspicion of arson and manslaughter.\n\nThis city wants to ban sleeping and camping on the beach but it has no shelter.

Gavin Newsom dedicated his entire State of the State speech to one problem vexing the state: homelessness.\n\n\"Let's call it what it is, a disgrace, that the richest state in the richest nation, succeeding across so many sectors, is failing to properly house, heal and humanely treat so many of its own people,\" Newsom said.\n\nAmong a variety of proposals highlighted in the governor's speech on Wednesday, Newsom said he would deploy trailers for the homeless to half a dozen counties, reduce street homelessness through emergency actions, and help homeless people who are mentally ill get the help they need.\n\n\"The public has lost patience, you have all lost patience, and so have I,\" he said.\n\nThe governor spoke a day after President Trump, during a visit to Los Angeles, threatened that if the state didn't do something about homelessness, the federal government would come in and \"clean it up.\"\n\nIt's a promise his administration has made many times before.\n\nThe $100,000-per-couple Trump ticket\n\nTrump returned to California on Wednesday (he spent Tuesday night in Vegas) for a fundraiser at the Rancho Mirage estate of Oracle chairman Larry Ellison. Tickets cost $100,000 per couple to attend; $250,000 for those who wanted his ear on policy.\n\nAt Palm Springs International Airport, Trump got off Air Force One and headed straight for a contingent of adoring fans, some chanting, “Four more years!”\n\nSharman Dow of La Quinta excitedly relayed the experience of shaking Trump's hand. \"From the moment he came down that escalator in New York,\" she said, referring to his 2015 campaign announcement, \"I turned to my husband and said, 'This guy gets America.' \"\n\nBut it wasn’t all fansville in the desert. Hundreds of opponents rallied in Rancho Mirage with signs and chants of their own: “Hey-hey, ho-ho, Donald Trump has got to go.”\n\nFrom Coachella Valley, Trump headed for Bakersfield, where he finalized a controversial decision that benefits water users in the western San Joaquin Valley and weakens endangered species protection.\n\nThe move to divert water to farmers is in keeping with Trump's priorities, but Newsom's silence has some wondering why he isn't doing more on the water issue.\n\nWhat else we're talking about\n\nKobe Bryant fans, I can't tell you where he's been laid to rest, but it isn't this cemetery in Corona Del Mar.

            "content": "This story was originally published by Grist and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration\n\nThe Kominek family farm is a green expanse of hay and alfalfa in northern Colorado. The family has planted and raked crops for half a century, but as yields declined over recent years, the farm began losing money. In late 2017, Byron Kominek went looking for more profitable alternatives, including installing solar panels and selling electricity to the utility. But Boulder County’s land-use codes made it difficult to use their 24 acres for anything but farming.\n\nSo the Komineks found a compromise: a solar array with plants growing beneath, between, and around rows of photovoltaic panels.\n\nConstruction is slated to begin this spring on a 1.2-megawatt solar array on the Kominek farm. Some 3,300 solar panels will rest on 6-foot and 8-foot-high stilts, providing shade for crops like tomatoes, peppers, kale, and beans on a five-acre plot. Pasture grasses and beehive boxes are planned for the perimeter.\n\n“Now there will be potentially more food grown in the community, more renewable energy, and more revenue to local farms,” said Kominek, 37, whose late grandfather Jack bought the farm in 1972.\n\nIf successful, the project could serve as a model for other cash-strapped farmers, by transforming underperforming fields into potentially money-making hubs of clean energy and fresh food.\n\nXcel Energy, the state’s biggest utility, has agreed to pay for each kilowatt-hour delivered from the Kominek’s solar array to the grid. Their neighbors can buy into the project, too. Participants invest in a percentage of the array, then receive credits on their monthly utility bills. Their investment also helps defray some of the farmers’ upfront construction costs.\n\nThe vegetables will be sold through a community farm-share program, which allows neighbors to invest in the project in exchange for boxes of produce.\n\nThis marriage of agriculture and solar photovoltaics — known by the awkward name “agrivoltaics” — is an emerging niche within the broader solar power industry.\n\nIn the United States, less than 5 megawatts’ worth of solar arrays have crops planted beneath them, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL. That’s barely a speck of the country’s 71,300 megawatts of installed solar capacity. The farm-plus-solar sector is relatively bigger in Japan, where the concept first emerged over a decade ago. Hundreds of projects now exist, including a 35-megawatt solar array that hovers over fields of ginseng, herbs, and coriander.\n\nProponents say that this approach could allow for widespread renewable energy development without displacing much-needed land for food. Recent studies suggest that it could lead to more efficient energy and crop production by creating a cooler, moister microclimate.\n\nIn a recent test in Arizona, scientists compared crops planted under solar panels with those grown in direct sunlight. They found that total fruit production for red chiltepin peppers was three times higher on the plots under the panels, and cherry tomatoes doubled production. Some of these plants used significantly less irrigation water, in part because the shaded soil retained more moisture. Solar panels placed with plants were also substantially cooler during the day — and therefore operated more efficiently — than the usual ground-mounted arrays, according to the study last year by NREL and the Universities of Arizona and Maryland.\n\nA project in South Deerfield, Massachusetts, delivered similarly promising results. Early field tests showed that Swiss chard, broccoli, and similar vegetables produced about 60 percent more volume compared to plants beneath a full sun.\n\nKominek’s project, called Jack’s Solar Garden, will provide more opportunities to study agrivoltaics. NREL, in nearby Golden, Colorado, plans to track how plants and panels perform together in Boulder County’s hot, dry climate. “If the structures help keep in moisture, and we have less evaporation, we’ll need less water to grow the same amount or even more [crops],” said Jordan Macknick, the lead energy-water-land analyst for NREL.\n\nMacknick leads NREL’s low-impact solar initiative along with biologist Brenda Beatty. Since 2015, researchers have developed more than 25 sites around the country that combine solar panels with food crops, native vegetation, or pollinator-friendly plants.\n\nJack’s Solar Garden will be the biggest of the group and the first to include all three types. NREL is also adding solar projects in Puerto Rico, including one on a coffee plantation and another one on pasture lands for cattle.\n\n“We’re really just at the very beginning of understanding the benefits of agrivoltaics and what they could mean not only for the energy sector but also for the agricultural sector,” Macknick said.\n\nAgrivoltaics, also called “solar sharing,” first took off in Japan in 2004, after an engineer, Akira Nagashima, developed a stilted steel structure that raises panels 10-feet high. Available land is scarce in Japan, a country with ambitious targets for developing renewable energy. (Not coincidentally, floating solar arrays — which sit atop irrigation ponds and reservoirs — also got their start in Japan, in 2007.) Recently, Nagashima has begun studying how shade-intolerant crops might fare beneath solar arrays. His research team recently found that corn yields slightly improved in a solar-sharing system.\n\nBeyond research sites, however, pairing corn and other cash crops with solar may present significant challenges. On existing plots, smaller tractors can navigate the narrow spaces between rows of panels. But combine harvesters and other industrial equipment are too wide and bulky to fit through the gaps. Most crops grown beneath panels must be picked by hand. The work is manageable at the scale of a community garden, but it can be grueling, back-breaking work at an industrial scale. Farmers are developing machines to pick strawberries, melons, and tomatoes, which also might bump against the panels.\n\nFor farms big and small, a lack of rural infrastructure remains a “key impediment” to boosting adoption of agrivoltaics, said Chad Higgins, an associate professor of biological and ecological engineering at Oregon State University. Power lines and electrical equipment might not be equipped to handle the addition of solar power. Roads and communications networks likewise might need to be expanded to support far-flung operations, he said.\n\nStill, if farmers and engineers can address such hurdles, the potential for agrivoltaics is immense, given how much of the planet’s land is devoted to agriculture. If these “solar-sharing” systems covered even less than 1 percent of the world’s cropland, they could produce enough solar power to meet the world’s annual energy needs, Higgins and other researchers said in an analysis last year. They found that the best places for growing crops are the same areas with strong potential for producing solar power, particularly in the western United States, southern Africa, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n“We have this vision of solar panels out in the desert, in these really open arid areas,” Higgins said. But solar panels are most efficient in climates with plenty of sun and moderate temperatures. Extreme heat can overtax the panels and result in lower electricity production. The same is true for plants.\n\nAt Jack’s Solar Garden in Colorado, the solar array construction this spring will kick off a list of related efforts. The Komineks will plant grasses to help prepare the five-acre plot for next year’s vegetable crops, and local members of the National Audubon Society will start planting a large pollinator habitat around the project’s perimeter. The 1.2-megawatt array is expected to begin delivering electricity to Xcel Energy’s grid by early fall.\n\nByron Kominek said he hopes similar projects will soon follow. In 2018, Boulder County officials updated the local land-use codes to allow for community solar on land otherwise designated for agriculture, and Kominek plans to help train other farmers how to grow crops alongside solar panels. “The hope is that young farmers will have a better understanding of how to do this, and will go out to already built solar arrays, or planned solar arrays, and find a new profession,” he said."

            "content": "When the Soviet Union began its collapse in 1989, the world witnessed decentralization and secession on a scale not seen in Europe since the nineteenth century.\n\nOver the next several years, puppet regimes and states-in-name-only broke away from Soviet domination and formed sovereign states. Some states which had completely ceased to exist—such as the Baltic states—declared independence and became states in the own right. In total, secession and decentralization in this era brought about more than twenty newly independent states.\n\nThis period served as an important reminder that human history is not, in fact, just a story of ever increasing state power and centralization.\n\nSince then, however, the world has seen very few successful secession movements. A handful of new countries have come into being over the past twenty years, such as East Timor and South Sudan. But in spite of many efforts by separatists worldwide, there have been few changes to the lines on the maps.\n\nThis has certainly been the case in Europe and the Americas, where from Quebec to Scotland to Catalonia to Venice demands for independence have been met with trepidation and sometimes outright threats of violence from central governments. Anatomy of the State Murray Rothbard Best Price: $5.00 Buy New $5.82 (as of 05:45 EST - Details)\n\nCountries Don’t Like to Get Smaller\n\nThis is partly due to the fact state organizations—that is, the people who control them—have little motivation to give up the benefits conferred by bigness. States that control larger geographic areas and larger populations have greater ability to project their power and get more power.\n\nGreater size means a larger frontier that can act as a physical buffer between the state’s enemies and the state’s economic core. Physical size is also helpful in terms of pursuing self-sufficiency in both energy production and agriculture. More land means greater potential for resource extraction and acreage devoted to food production. From the state’s perspective, these activities are good things because they can be taxed or expropriated.\n\nIn terms of population size, state control over larger populations means more human workers to tax, and, potentially, more highly productive urban workers. Historically at least, larger populations also provided personnel for military uses.\n\nThus, states that control large territories and populations are able to directly control larger and more diverse economies within their borders. This means more tax revenue, which in turn means greater military capability. Naturally, state organizations are not inclined to abandon these advantages lightly, even when secession movement express a desire that they do so.\n\nWhy States Sometimes Get Smaller\n\nSometimes, though, states are forced to contract in size and scope. This usually happens when the cost of maintaining the status quo becomes higher than the cost of allowing a region to gain autonomy.\n\nHistorically, the cost of maintaining unity is raised through military means. Examples of this tactic being successfully employed include the cases of the United States, the Republic of Ireland, and some of the successor states of Yugoslavia.\n\nBut secession and decentralization have also often been achieved through bloodless or near bloodless means. This was the case in Iceland and throughout most of the post-Iron Curtain states.\n\nBloodless secession movements, however, only occur when the parent state is weakened by larger events beyond the secession movement itself. Iceland, for example, seceded in 1944, when World War II ensured that Denmark was in no position to object. The post-Soviet states seceded when the Soviet state had been rendered impotent by decades of economic decline and (in 1991) a failed coup. Nor is it a coincidence that India gained independence from the United Kingdom in the years immediately following World War II. It is likely the UK could have held on to India through military means indefinitely, but this would have come at a very high cost to the British economy and standard of living.\n\nIt is possible to envision largely “amicable” separations. The model for this is the separation of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand from the the United Kingdom. But even in these cases, British control over these Commonwealth states’ foreign policy was not totally abandoned until after World War II, when the British state had been weakened by depression and war. Moreover, the British state assumed that these newly independent states would remain highly reliable geopolitical and economic allies indefinitely. Thus, the geopolitical cost of separation was perceived to be low.\n\nMega-States Are the Ideal State\n\nIn cases where the seceding state is perceived to have differing cultural, economic, or geopolitical interests—which is true of the overwhelming majority of cases—the parent state is, all else being equal, likely to meet demands for secession with much hostility.\n\nAlthough liberal ideology has diminished the perception among much of the world’s population that bigger is better, most government agents—who are by nature decidedly illiberal—see things differently. For them, the ideal state is most certainly a large state.\n\nThose who delight in the generous application of state violence have noticed that it is not a coincidence the world’s most powerful states—e.g., the US, Russia, China—are those that control large populations, large economic centers, and large geographic areas with sizable frontiers. The combination of these three factors in various configuration ensures that existential threats to the regime are few and far between. Russia’s relatively small economy—only a fraction of the size of Germany’s economy—is mitigated by its enormous geographical frontiers. Its economy is nonetheless large enough to maintain a nuclear arsenal. China’s per capita wealth is quite small, but Chinese territory and the sheer size of its overall economy ensures protection from foreign attack. The US’s enormous economy and its huge ocean frontiers render it essentially immune to all existential threats other than large-scale nuclear war.\n\nLarge states such as these are limited only by the defensive capabilities of other states, and by the threat of domestic unrest and resistance. As Ludwig von Mises noted in Liberalism, states can take only as much power as their populations are willing to give it. There are limits to the public’s generosity.\n\nTotalitarian States Require Bigness\n\nThis relationship between bigness and state power has been illustrated in the fact totalitarian states are virtually always large states.\n\nIn her book The Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt examines a number of nontotalitarian dictatorships that sprang up in Europe before the Second World War. These included (among others) the Baltic states, Hungary, Portugal, and Romania. In many of these cases, Arendt contends the regimes attempted to turn themselves into totalitarian regimes, but failed. This was largely due to their lack of size:\n\nAlthough [totalitarian ideology] had served well enough to organize the masses until the movement seized power, the absolute size of the country then forced the would-be totalitarian ruler of masses into the more familiar patterns of class or party dictatorship. The truth is that these countries simply did not control enough human material to allow for total domination and its inherent great losses in population. Without much hope for the conquest of more heavily populated territories, the tyrants in these small countries were forced into a certain old-fashioned moderation lest they lose whatever people they had to rule. This is also why Nazism, up to the outbreak of the war and its expansion over Europe, lagged so far behind its Russian counterpart in consistency and ruthlessness; even the German people were not numerous enough to allow for the full development of this newest form of government. Only if Germany had won the war would she have known a fully developed totalitarian rulership.\n\nArendt was not an economist, but had she been one, she might have noted that the necessity of size is so central to totalitarian regimes because they are so economically inefficient. Contrary to promises of machine-like efficiency made by advocates of ever more powerful states, totalitarian states are absurdly wasteful both in terms of capital and human life. The same is true—to varying extents—for all regimes. But as the most centrally-planned ones—whether totalitarian or not—quickly become economic basket cases, large size is necessary. A smaller state would quickly exhaust its capital and its population, and the regime would collapse. Size can provide the appearance of sustainability for longer.\n\nCultural factors cannot be ignored, however. Arendt concedes this process of collapse can be drawn out longer in societies that are more ideologically tolerant of it:\n\nConversely, the chances for totalitarian rule are frighteningly good in the lands of traditional Oriental despotism, in India and China…\n\nThat region’s relative tolerance for despotism is enabled by local ideologies that foster a “feeling of superfluousness,” which according to Arendt “has been prevalent for centuries in the contempt for the value of human life.”\n\nContinued Movement toward Smaller States\n\nThe Origins of Totalit... Hannah Arendt Best Price: $8.49 Buy New $12.90 (as of 06:35 EST - Details) Fortunately for humanity, the trend in the world today is toward smaller states. As numerous scholars have noted, the average number of states in the world is larger now than at any other time in recent centuries. Moreover, the rise of global trade has lessened the benefits of imperialism and expanding a state’s frontiers and population. As Mises observed, freedom in trade negates the need for a state to acquire more of the world’s wealth through militaristic or imperialistic methods. States often still seek economic “self-sufficiency,” but the cost of this is so high, and the benefits of open trade so enticing, that more states are willing to accept trade as a substitute for “lebensraum.” This can already be observed, as globalization has allowed small states to thrive, and small states have even acted to force greater discipline on large states through tax competition.\n\nThere are certainly exceptions to this. Some small states, such as North Korea, have maintained an economically isolationist and totalitarian stance—fueled both by internal paranoia and by real perennial threats issued by its enemies (especially the US), in the case of the latter. For the most part, however, the spread of markets (and promarket ideology) has raised the opportunity cost of militaristic expansion from the state’s perspective. If offered the chance to expand at low cost, though, virtually all regimes would take the opportunity in a heartbeat. And this is why we will likely continue to see regimes enthusiastically resist secession within their own borders. States don’t have many opportunities to expand their territories and populations. So they’re not about to sign off on secession lightly. Nevertheless, new economic realities, wars, and demographic shifts may certainly affect the equation in coming years. And then we may again see a redrawing of maps of a sort not seen since the end of the Cold War.\n\nNote: The views expressed on Mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute.\n\nThe Best of Ryan McMaken"

            "content": "NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: A proposed trade deal between India and the US was not \"stuck\" and both sides mutually agreed \"not to rush\" into it, official sources in New Delhi said hours after American president Donald Trump suggested that such a pact may not be sealed during his maiden India visit as he is \"saving the big deal\" for later.Ahead of his two-day visit, starting from February 24, Trump also told reporters in Washington that India has not treated the US \"very well\" on the trade front but \"I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot.\"Full-scale preparations are afoot in New Delhi, Agra and Ahmedabad to welcome Trump, his wife Melania Trump and a high-level delegation from the US administration. The first couple of the US will begin their much-anticipated India visit from Ahmedabad, where they will attend \"Namaste Trump\" event at the newly built Motera Cricket Stadium. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be present at the event.A number of deals including the USD 2.6 billion contract to procure 24 naval helicopters from the US by India could be fructified during Trump's nearly 36 hour-long scheduled visit that is aimed at further invigorating defence, trade and strategic ties, official sources said.India does not expect that Jammu and Kashmir will figure in the talks as the US State Department has already said that it is an issue which should be resolved bilaterally between India and Pakistan, sources noted.On the trade deal, a source said, \"we do not want to rush into a deal as it will have long-term economic consequences. We do not want to take decisions for short term.\"Besides the trade deal, sources said both the countries are also looking at a Free Trade Agreement for deeper trade and investment ties, adding India will seek inclusion of India under the Generalized System of Preferences by the US.During an interaction with reporters at the Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, Trump said, \"well, we can have a trade deal with India, but I'm really saving the big deal for later on.\"\"We're doing a very big trade deal with India. We'll have it. I don't know if it'll be done before the election (in November), but we'll have a very big deal with India,\" he added.Trump, forcefully pursuing his 'America first' policy, has previously described India as a \"tariff king\" for imposing \"tremendously high\" tariffs on American products.The US president will be accompanied by a high level delegation which is likely to include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. However, there is uncertainty surrounding the visit of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the point-person for trade negotiations with India.Multiple rounds of telephonic conversations have taken place between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Lighthizer in the past few weeks ahead of the presidential visit.India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), greater market access for its products from sectors including agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, and cut on import duties on some ICT products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India which was USD 16.9 billion in 2018-19.Though Trump is not happy with the bilateral trade ties, he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he is looking forward to his visit to India.\"I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot,\" Trump said.\"He (Modi) told me we'll have seven million people between the airport and the event. And the stadium, I understand, is sort of semi under construction, but it's going to be the largest stadium in the world. So it's going to be very exciting... I hope you all enjoy it,\" he told reporters.Trump was referring to a scheduled joint public rally with Modi in Ahmedabad, capital of Gujarat.Meanwhile, the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) in a report said the latest quarterly data depict continuation of overall positive bilateral trade trends. The third quarter data reflects some downslide in growth rates.\"It may be due to several reasons, including the unexpected economic slowdown in India's economic growth, impact of US-China trade war, GSP withdrawal from the US side and retaliatory tariffs on specific US goods from the Indian side,\" it said.According to the report, the data available for the first three quarters of 2019 (January-September) pulled the overall growth rate in cumulative bilateral trade down to 4.5 per cent from 8.4 per cent registered for the first two quarters.Goods and services trade performance in third quarter was dismal at -2.3 per cent, in contrast with the impressive 9.6 per cent growth witnessed for the first two quarters of the year; while trade in services was up two per cent goods trade dropped five per cent, the report said.The cumulative US-India trade in goods and services (USD 110.9 billion) for the first three quarters of 2019 increased 4.5 per cent with US exports and imports growing at four percent and five per cent respectively.The US remains the top trading partner for India in terms of trade in goods and services, followed by China.The US goods exports to India were mainly in mineral fuels, precious stones, and aircraft. The US faces tough competition with China in the Indian market in areas such as electronics, machinery, organic chemicals and medical devices."

            "content": "EU leaders are to hold a Brussels summit Thursday to set a seven-year budget despite splits between some stingy rich nations, poorer ones wanting to preserve spending and wanting to fund grand global ambitions.\n\nThe money tussle, hard-fought at the best of times, is especially problematic this time around because of Britain's departure from the EU.\n\nThe \"Brexit gap\" caused by the loss of the UK's contribution is 75 billion euros ($81 billion) over the 2021-2027 period.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on the eve of the summit predicted \"very tough and difficult negotiations\" around the table.\n\nThe talks are expected to be so strained that some of the 27 EU delegations are preparing for the summit to drag out into the weekend.\n\nA few EU sources, however, suggested differences over the budget are so great the summit could end quickly and the can kicked down the road to another summit -- or two -- in the coming months.\n\nAn analyst at the European Policy Centre, Marta Pilati, agreed, saying: \"There likely won't be agreement at this summit. All the member states aren't showing much willingness to compromise.\" The minimum spending in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF), as the long-term budget is called, is just over one trillion euros.\n\nThe discord is over how much above that amount this budget should be, how spending might be shifted between priorities and how much each member state should pay as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nAnother touchy issue is whether budget rebates pocketed by a few wealthier countries should still exist.\n\nThe last MFF came in at 1.08 trillion euros (in 2018 prices).\n\nA \"frugal four\" group of nations -- Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden -- wants to rein in the budget and make up only some of the ground of the Brexit gap. They also want to keep their rebates, as does Germany.\n\nAt the high end of spending demands is the European Parliament, which wants the MFF expanded to 1.32 trillion euros to pay for costly goals such as turning the into a carbon-neutral economy within three decades.\n\nThe legislature, which has to sign off on the final MFF, believes more money can be raised from EU-wide taxes on plastics and on the carbon emissions trading scheme.\n\nA \"friends of cohesion\" group of mostly eastern and southern EU nations wants to ringfence money it gets to help bring infrastructure and society up to the level of wealthier counterparts.\n\nAgriculturally sensitive countries such as France, Spain and Poland are also looking to preserve farmers' subsidies. France would like to also see extra money for common security and defence and the \"unfair\" rebates scrapped.\n\nThe European Commission, which aims for a \"geopolitical\" mantle under President Ursula von der Leyen, is trying for a target of 1.13 trillion euros.\n\nThe president of the European Council, Charles Michel, who calls and coordinates summits, believes he can at least narrow positions.\n\nHis MFF proposal is 1.09 trillion euros and makes cuts to cohesion funds and farm subsidies to finance other priority areas.\n\nA senior EU official said Michel's plan would re-allocate \"about eight billion euros from richer to poorer member states\".\n\nHis plan, though, has little support.\n\nThe European Parliament has rejected it as too little. Germany says it is a \"step backwards\" and Spain has criticised it for \"not recognising the role of agriculture\" in EU cohesion.\n\nBut the senior EU official said Michel believes the splits will not change over the coming months and he \"is very determined to clinch a deal in the coming days."

Eventually, they were able to buy a small house in Harrow and used that to secure a bank loan for their first shop, a newsagent in Tottenham. Priti and her younger sister and brother were frequently called upon to work alongside their parents in the several shops and sub-post offices they ran in Nottingham, Ipswich and Norwich. When Priti became secondary school age, the family bought an upmarket chocolate shop in Hertfordshire where there were good state schools, including Watford Grammar where she was head girl.

            "content": "Tanzania accumulated $5.5 billion worth of gold and dollar reserves by the first half of 2019/2020, covering more than six months of imports.\n\nThe country's benchmark is at least four months' reserve of imports cover, while for EAC is four and a half months and SADC six months of import cover.\n\nThe Bank of Tanzania, in its Monetary Policy Statement Mid-Year Review released last week, attributes the good run to the increase in value of exports specifically from the non-traditional goods counter of minerals and manufactured goods.\n\n\"The value of exports of goods and services increased by 25.5 per cent to $5.554 billion from the level registered in the first half of 2018/2019, due to increase in the value of export of non-traditional goods,\" said BoT.\n\nBy the end of the first half of 2019/2020, data shows the value of non-traditional goods exports increased by 39.3 per cent to $2.363 billion, largely driven by manufactured goods and gold.\n\nExports of manufactured goods increased by 19.2 per cent to $518.6 million from $435.2 million in the same period in 2018/2019. The increase is attributed to a rise in exports of iron and steel products, glass and glassware, manufactured tobacco, sisal yarn and twine.\n\nAs of January 2020, manufactured goods recorded a 24 per cent increase of $984.9 million, driven by sisal yarn and twine, iron and steel products, glass and glassware, manufactured tobacco and fertilisers.\n\nGold, which accounted for 53.7 per cent of non-traditional goods exports, increased by 59.6 per cent to $1.268 billion from $795.1 million in 2018/2019 on account of both volume and favourable prices at the world market.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Tanzania Business By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

            "content": "Paradise Dam inquiry hears key construction documents are yet to be located\n\nPosted\n\nAn independent Inquiry into the structural issues of Bundaberg's Paradise Dam has heard documents relating to its construction are missing, and appropriate core testing of its strength may not have occurred after it was built.\n\nKey points: A commission of inquiry is yet to locate a full construction report for Paradise Dam\n\nThe inquiry was instigated after technical reports revealed faults originated in its initial construction\n\nThe dam wall stability is at risk and major flooding is possible if 2013 flood conditions repeated\n\nCommissioner John Byrne gave his opening statement in Brisbane and said the commission would examine the root cause of the structural issues of the dam through documents and reports, and more than a dozen potential witnesses.\n\nIn November 2019, the Queensland Government announced an inquiry into the structural issues of Paradise Dam after technical reports showed the faults originated with its initial construction.\n\nMr Byrne said since the commission began its investigation, it had collected, collated, and made progress in analysing more than 30,000 documents and photographs.\n\n\"Some documents are of considerable length, and many deal with complex geotechnical, hydrological and engineering matters,\" he said.\n\nHe said Paradise Dam, which was built by the State Government between 2003 and 2005, was an important asset to the community.\n\n\"I recognise that the dam and its future are important to communities in the Wide Bay Burnett region, especially those who rely on the Bundaberg Irrigation Scheme,\" Mr Bryne said.\n\nDocuments missing\n\nCounsel assisting, Jonathan Horton, however, revealed the commission was yet to locate documents relating to the construction of Paradise Dam.\n\n\"We have, for example, attempted to locate a construction report which ought to exist, but a full version of it has not been able to be found,\" he said.\n\nMr Horton said Paradise Dam was constructed with roller-compacted concrete, (RCC) and was one of the first of its kind in Australia, but no strength testing was carried out to determine if the layers had bonded.\n\n\"No shear strength testing was undertaken,\" he said.\n\n\"We wish to look more closely at what occurred in late 2005 and early 2006 with respect to decisions about what could and should be the subject of shear testing.\n\n\"What were the decisions made during the course of design and construction about cement content, composition of the RCC mix generally, and the use of bedding mix between layers?\"\n\nInquiry to report by April\n\nThree out of the 13 days of hearings will be heard in Bundaberg and the rest will be in Brisbane, with recommendations to be provided to the Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and the Minister for Natural Resources and Mines by the end of April.\n\nThe commissioners are expected to consider SunWater's technical reports from 2013 onwards that detail structural issues originated with its construction.\n\nThe terms of reference state they may seek information from individuals and government bodies involved in the design, construction, and commissioning of Paradise Dam.\n\nA community wanting answers\n\nBundaberg Mayor Jack Dempsey hoped the inquiry would determine how one of Australia's youngest dams came to be so flawed, and who was responsible.\n\n\"It's one of the largest infrastructure failures in history,\" Councillor Dempsey said.\n\n\"Only six months ago we had a reputation for the second most secure water supply in Australia, and that has been affected.\n\n\"Council will be putting forward a submission, whether it be a written or verbal submission.\n\n\"We certainly want to ensure that all avenues are looked at, and this certainly goes to the structural investigation.\"\n\nCouncillor Dempsey said the whole situation had caused friction in the Bundaberg community, with SunWater's own technical reports stating if the dam failed more than 100 lives would be at risk downstream.\n\n\"People with concerns should know that the local disaster management group, and the district disaster management group are well prepared in terms of every contingency,\" he said.\n\nQuestions over the future of Paradise Dam\n\nSunWater is seeking a contractor to begin construction work to lower the dam's spillway by 5 metres after legislation was rushed through State Parliament earlier this month.\n\nFederal Minister for Water, Keith Pitt, said the State Government bypassed its own environmental laws by allowing the work to proceed without any other environmental or council approvals.\n\nHe said the focus should now be on the future of the dam and returning water security for the agriculture industry, which was estimating a $1 billion hit to the state's economy.\n\n\"My view is very straightforward: we make safe, we repair, we restore, or we replace this critical piece of infrastructure for this region,\" he said.\n\n\"I say to Premier Palaszczuk, safety has to be the first priority, but the second has to be how do we repair, restore, or retain that facility.\"\n\n\"It will take more than a decade to build anything else or even to get the approvals could take 10 years.\"\n\nThe long-term future of the dam will be determined by Building Queensland with a report due to be handed to the Government also at the end of April.\n\nTopics: dams-and-reservoirs, rivers, water-management, water-supply, water, government-and-politics,

It will contact other agencies, particularly Israel's Ministry of Public Health,\" Mr Natapanu said.\n\nThailand hoped Israel would review the ban after learning about the measures Thailand is taking to contain the virus, and given the good relations between the countries.\n\nMeir Shlomo, Israel's ambassador to Thailand, told the Bangkok Post on Wednesday that the decision was aimed at preventing the spread of the Covid-19 to Israel.\n\nIsraeli ministries were following developments closely and re-assessing the situation in Thailand and in the other countries on a daily basis, he said, adding no one knew at this stage how long the current situation would last.\n\n\"Several thousand Thai tourists, businesspeople and workers in agriculture travel to Israel every year. We do hope they will all be able to reschedule their flights and travel to Israel in the very near future,\" he said.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "analysis\n\nEgypt, Ethiopia and Sudan are currently engaged in vital talks over the dispute relating to the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile River. While non-African actors are increasingly present in the negotiations, the African Union (AU) is playing a marginal role.\n\nIn addition to supporting negotiations and the implementation of a possible agreement, there are critical lessons from the negotiations for the AU on how to manage future maritime and freshwater disputes.\n\nWith the involvement of the United States (US) and World Bank, the parties have convened over eight rounds of negotiations in two months. Despite making some headway, a conclusive agreement is yet to be signed. Major disputes persist over the timeline of filling the reservoir, and mitigation measures to be taken in case of drought.\n\nThe Nile River is a trans-boundary resource shared by 11 African countries including Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. To date though, there is no approved framework on the water's management and use. The three countries almost reached an agreement after 10 years of negotiation in 2010. But Egypt and Sudan didn't sign it mainly due to concerns of 'water insecurity' arising from a broader deal affecting their share of water for agriculture, industry and hydroelectric power generation.\n\nDisputes persist over the timeline of filling the reservoir, and mitigation measures in case of drought\n\nIn 2011, Ethiopia unilaterally started construction of the dam over the Blue Nile, a major tributary to the Nile. In addition to country-level benefits, Ethiopia claims that the dam has wide significance for regional integration, particularly regarding affordable electricity supply.\n\nWhile Sudan supports the dam's construction, Egypt initially rejected it because it considers it an existential challenge. Egypt later accepted the project and the three countries signed a negotiated Declaration of Principles agreement in 2015 - the basis for the ongoing technical talks.\n\nAfter the tripartite agreement, expert-level negotiations on the safety, filling and operation of the dam were progressing among the countries. But the internal political crisis and ensuing regime changes in Ethiopia and Sudan in 2018 and 2019 respectively delayed the process.\n\nThe delays have led to a resurgence of concerns over regional instability. This was raised by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019, leading to his call for international pressure on Ethiopia. A month later, Egypt declared the talks had reached a dead end and requested international intervention.\n\nRussia facilitated meetings between Egypt and Ethiopia's leaders in Sochi on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa summit in October 2019. The leaders agreed to resume negotiations. Russia's President Vladimir Putin offered his help, but the two countries settled on US and World Bank mediations.\n\nSince November, five rounds of technical negotiations and over three rounds of ministerial-level meetings have been convened. Although high-level US and World Bank officials have attended as 'observers', their role is increasingly seen as providing alternative courses of action to the impasse. After the last round of negotiations, the US said the countries would sign the agreement by the end of February. It now seems more time is needed to finalise the deal.\n\nWith its multilateral nature, the AU could be a more neutral arbiter in the dispute\n\nThe AU has the primary responsibility to promote peace, security and stability in Africa - anchored in the principle of 'African solutions to Africa's problems'. However it hasn't featured highly in the dam negotiations, with non-African actors instead becoming part of the solution. This is a missed opportunity considering that the AU's multilateral nature and aspirations to lead on regional stability make it a more neutral arbiter.\n\nThe AU's silence on the issue, at least in public, was especially evident when tensions escalated between Egypt and Ethiopia. The two countries exchanged provocative statements including threats to use military measures to resolve the dispute. In response, the Arab Parliament expressed its concern and offered support to Egypt and Sudan.\n\nThroughout all of this, the AU didn't issue a single statement. In March 2019 the AU Peace and Security Council (PSC) encouraged member states to find peaceful solutions, but the council has since failed to discuss the dispute.\n\nThis may show a lack of determination by the AU and its member states to resolve disputes while invoking the rhetoric of 'African solutions to Africa's problems'. But the AU may have other reasons for its silence.\n\nAccording to Institute for Security Studies Senior Research Fellow Andrews Atta-Asamoah, the AU doesn't have a history of pronouncing itself on sensitive issues. And politics on the PSC means that member states often refrain from placing difficult topics on the council's agenda, says Atta-Asamoah. Any 'wrong move' affects the neutrality, acceptance and utility of the AU in the minds of some member states.\n\nPerhaps the AU doesn't have the appetite to resolve sensitive disputes between influential states\n\nAn African diplomat who wishes to remain anonymous suggested to ISS Today that the AU perhaps doesn't have the appetite to engage in sensitive dispute resolution between two such influential member states. He also says the AU may lack the capacity to mediate such a complex, technical problem.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Africa Ethiopia Environment By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

It could back the negotiation process from the beginning as well as the amicable enforcement of the agreement that emerges. Revisiting the process around these negotiations could help the AU resolve similar maritime and freshwater disputes in future.\n\nThe AU and AU Commission chairs could also use their positions to support the negotiations. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed recently asked South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa - the AU's 2020 chair - to mediate its disputes with Egypt. This could be a step towards home-grown solutions.\n\nThe AU should reflect on the extent and timeliness of its responses to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam negotiations to ensure it isn't sidelined in future processes involving its member states. It may not always be the lead actor, but the AU's presence is important to ensure African ownership and leadership in promoting continental peace and security.\n\nMeressa K Dessu, Senior Researcher and Training Coordinator, Dawit Yohannes, Senior Researcher and Roba D Sharamo, Regional Director, ISS Addis Ababa"

It portrays the life of rural Chinese folks, and the effects on them of rapid changes in agriculture. The film looks at the connections between three generations of the family, and their deep affection for their land, during a time when modernization is transforming agriculture from traditional to industrial.\n\nThe film, which is expected to start shooting in China’s northwest in August, is being produced by Liu Xuan for Dongchun Films and WXS Production Studio. The companies previously partnered on Wang’s “Red Amnesia” (2014), which premiered in Venice.\n\n“Above the Dust” is Wang’s 14th narrative feature film. Previous titles include “In Love We Trust” (2008), winner of the Berlin Silver Bear for screenplay; “Beijing Bicyle” (2001), winner of Berlin’s Grand Jury Silver Bear; and Cannes’ Grand Jury Prize winner “Shanghai Dreams” (2005)."

I hear they're pounding him,\" the president continued. \"I think he spent all this money, he has maybe 15 points. Hey, fake news, how many points does he have? They won't tell you the truth.\"\n\nTRUMP BLASTS 'FAKE' POLLS, SAYS INTERNAL NUMBERS SHOW HIM BEATING OTHER 2020 DEMS\n\nThen Trump took a shot at MSNBC, which televised the debate, calling the left-leaning network \"MSDNC.\"\n\n\"MSDNC is worse than CNN, and they're all pretty bad,\" he said, to a round of boos.\n\nTrump also hit Bloomberg for \"buying\" his candidacy, as the president put it.\n\n\"Mini Mike has spent $411 million so far. That idiot [Tom] Steyer -- we call him 'Impeachment Steyer' -- he spent $210 million and look where that got him. I think he got one-third of one percent in Iowa. I never even heard of him.\"\n\nHe added, \"Hillary [Clinton] spent three times more than we did and lost.\"\n\n'Hotter than Trump'\n\nTrump had kicked off the rally by paying tribute to a World War II veteran who was carried into the rally by two Trump supporters, a clip of which circulated on social media.\n\n\"I don't know if he knows it. He’s right now the hottest celebrity in the world. Maybe even hotter than Trump,\" the president said.\n\n\"He's all over television; even fake news CNN had him on,\" Trump said of WWII veteran Irvin Julian.\n\nTouting the economy\n\nTrump focused on his economic record, saying his administration has set 144 records on the stock market.\n\n\"From our rural communities to our inner cities we are expanding the American blessings. We added 225,000 jobs last month, did you see that?\" Trump said.\n\nThen he took a shot at former President Barack Obama, who had once claimed Trump would need a \"magic wand\" to make manufacturing jobs return to America.\n\n\"Many were manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back. Right?\" Trump told the crowd. \"You need a 'magic wand' to make them come back. They came back.\"\n\nTrump touted the unemployment rate, saying it was the lowest it's been in 51 years, adding that the average unemployment rate during his tenure was the lowest of any U.S. president in recorded history. He added that record-low unemployment rates were also posted for African-Americans, Hispanics, women, veterans, disabled people and workers without a high school diploma.\n\nTrump said his administration had lifted 10 million people off welfare.\n\n\"And happily!\" he added. \"They have jobs and they love going for work, and if they don't like that job they can get another one because people are starving to get great employees.\"\n\nTrump then said that he was \"cutting regulations like nobody has ever cut,\" and helped the U.S. to achieve energy independence for the first time.\n\n\"Such beautiful words!\" he said.\n\n'Extreme' Democrats\n\nTrump said that Democrats in Washington were \"more extreme than ever before.\"\n\n\"They're taking it from Crazy Bernie,\" he said, referring to democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nPivoting to health care, Trump said 180 million Americans would lose coverage under Sanders' health-care plan.\n\n\"Remember they built the $5 billion website?\" Trump said, referring to the healthcare.gov website unveiled with the ObamaCare health plan, which initially was fraught with bugs and glitches. \"Barron could have built you a website for about $2,\" Trump said, referring to his son.\n\nHe added, \"Socialist Democrats want to destroy American health care. We’re trying to protect it, and we’re going to protect pre-existing conditions.\"\n\n\"Socialist Democrats want to destroy American health care. We’re trying to protect it, and we’re going to protect pre-existing conditions.\" — President Trump\n\n\"I hear a lot of bad things about their vote count,\" the president said about the Democrats' early nominating contests. \"I hear they don't know what they're doing with the vote count in Iowa,\" he said referring to technical issues in vote counting at the Iowa caucuses which led to confusion over which candidate came out on top. \"We set a record in Iowa, we had more votes than anybody's ever had for an incumbent president,\" Trump boasted.\n\n3 Western stops\n\nTrump's event at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum was the first of three rallies in three days. He won Arizona over Hillary Clinton in 2016 by about 3.5 percent, but Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat, narrowly defeated Republican Sen. Martha McSally, in 2018. (McSally was later appointed to Arizona's other U.S. Senate seat when incumbent Sen. Jon Kyl resigned.)\n\nAfter Arizona, Trump is scheduled to take his tour to Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Thursday, and then Las Vegas on Friday, on the eve of Saturday's critical Nevada caucuses.\n\nWednesday's rally served to counter the Democrats taking the debate stage, as Sanders recently surged to the forefront of the race and Bloomberg’s heavily funded ad campaign has earned him his first debate appearance.\n\nSupporters of the president showed up in droves to attend the rally, using umbrellas to protect themselves from the Arizona sun as they waited hours to enter the arena.\n\nTrump blasted unspecified \"fake news polls\" earlier Wednesday, claiming his own internal polling showed him getting re-elected in November.\n\n\"Internal REAL Polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates,\" Trump tweeted. \"The Fake News Polls (here we go again, just like 2016) show losing or tied. Their polls will be proven corrupt on November 3rd, just like the Fake News is corrupt!\" It came after the ABC News/Washington Post survey was released, showing every major candidate among the Democrats beating Trump in general election matchups. That included former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders and Bloomberg, all of whom polled at or above 50 percent in matchups with Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHours before the rally, in California, Trump signed a memorandum directing more of that state's scarce water supply to farmers and other agriculture interests in the Central Valley, a Republican stronghold.\n\n“For too long water authorities have flushed millions of gallons into the Pacific,” Trump said. “I ordered the administration to update outdated opinions which determined water allocation in this state.”\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman and Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report."

            "content": "While the future of food may seem elusive, clues can be found in the culinary traditions of Mexico. Trek south of the U.S. border and you stand a good chance of coming across a chapulines or jumiles vendor. Chapulines add a nice kick to any tortilla or spicy food dish. They’re high in protein, low in fat, and the grasshoppers’ crispiness complements the softer texture of the tomatillo and avocado components. Jumiles, meanwhile, bring a cinnamon or minty taste to recipes and add an appealing crunch to salsa. These little stink bugs are also renowned for their curative abilities.\n\nThink of these delicacies as a kind of shrimp that live on land, if you need perspective. But the fact of the matter is that including insects in our diets is good for us and good for the planet. Of all the nutrients humans cultivate, protein has the biggest impact on the environment due to the vast quantities of water, land, and resources needed to grow the grass and corn that sustain our dairy, beef, and poultry industries.\n\nIn Oaxaca City, Oaxaca, locals often fill their corn tortillas with cilantro, onions, and chapulines, deep-fried grasshoppers seasoned with chile and lime.\n\nOur agriculture industry, and the land clearing that it requires, produced almost 23% of greenhouse gas emissions between 2007 and 2016. The fish-farming industry takes a toll on the aquatic environment because farms use chemicals, create waste, cultivate dangerous parasitic lice, and can spread disease to wild fish populations. The modern Western diet with its resource-heavy demands is quickly handing us an ecological catastrophe, according to research published in 2018 in Nature.\n\nAdd to that the fact that human population is on track to hit 10.9 billion by the year 2100, and we’re going to need enough protein to feed an extra 3 billion people. This calls for an all-hands-on-deck approach for individuals as well as production systems, opting for protein sources further down the food chain and capitalizing on innovations that allow us to produce meat without animals. Getting there will involve embracing protein that can be sourced from plants, grown in vivo, or fed with waste.\n\nPlanet-Friendly Protein\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is pushing hard for cheaper, healthier, and less resource-heavy alternatives to mammal and bird protein. This includes a practice that’s already common in 130 countries: entomophagy—eating insects. Indigenous cultures worldwide have enjoyed these sustainable protein sources for millennia. While Western cultures may cringe at the idea of arthropods as food (save for crustaceans, of course), more than 2 billion people include insects in their diets today, like the chapulines and jumiles in Mexico.\n\nPeople around the world eat an impressively diverse array of some 2,000 different species of insects, most of them harvested in the wild. The most common are beetles, accounting for about a third of total global consumption. Caterpillars enjoy their greatest popularity in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas bees, wasps, and ants are favorites in Latin America.\n\nWhat’s more, research shows that humans appear to be genetically predisposed to love the crunchy awesomeness of bugs even more than silky anteaters do. Despite arboreal ants comprising almost the entirety of the silky anteater’s diet, the animal’s excrement contains huge amounts of insect exoskeletons because they can’t digest chitin. But thanks to a common ancestor who crunched into bugs like a bag of Doritos every chance they got, primates, including people, are thought to have inherited a gene that produces a chitin-digesting enzyme. As a result, when it comes to eating ants, humans could have a digestive advantage over animals called “anteaters.”\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. has slowly started to get on the bug bandwagon. Kevin Bachhuber was eager to embrace humanity’s entomophagic history when he founded the first U.S. farm to receive FDA approval for food-grade insects in 2014.\n\nIf you’ve ever eaten sushi or drunk a smoothie with a bright green tint, you’ve already come across algae in your food.\n\n“We use Acheta domesticus, the common house cricket,” Bachhuber says. “But the ones found in your home are black field crickets—that’s an entirely different kind of cricket.”\n\nBachhuber confirmed that the bugs are cheap to raise, with a feed-to-meat ratio around 2:1. That means it takes about twice a cricket’s weight in food to produce one edible cricket. That’s about the same as growing a chicken to a harvestable size, according to some studies, but it’s nothing compared to the 6:1 ratio required to produce a pound of beef. Plus, Bachhuber claims a cricket’s waste pales next to the dangerous bacterial risk of hog lagoon runoff or the eau de parfum of a 30,000-bird industrial-grade chicken shed.\n\nSoldiering On\n\nAn even more efficient creature conjures protein from waste: the larvae of the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens. Unlike cows and chickens, these grubs don’t compete with humans for wheat and cornmeal. Instead, they eat potato peelings, bread remains, sugar beet pulp, seaweed, and animal and human manure. They can even handle the ethanol-saturated leftovers from a whiskey distillery.\n\nWhy would anybody eat such a voracious little savage? “They have a popcorn flavor to them—a little nutty,” says Jeff Tomberlin, an entomologist at Texas A&M University. Tomberlin co-founded Evo Conversion Systems LLC, to research black soldier fly larvae for animal feed. He’s also incorporating them into a kind of bug-based waste disposal system since a black soldier fly larva’s gut can apparently turn anything into protein, aside from bones, hair, and pineapple rinds. That includes dangerous pharmaceuticals and pesticides, Tomberline says. Trimethoprim, for example, is a caustic antibiotic that can linger in the environment for 25 days, but the corrosive digestive enzymes of black soldier fly larvae neutralize it in only 1.1 days, according to one study, and without any of it accumulating in the bug.\n\nTomberlin wants to drop the middle-pig, so to speak, and put the bug directly on American tables. He is a proponent of processing insects into ingredients for use in other foods; cricket flour, for example, is already available in stores and online.\n\nA Greener Source\n\nThe further one moves down the food chain, the fewer resources are required to produce the protein. That’s why Texas-based nutrition company iWi (pronounced “ee-we”) cultivates Nannochloropsis algae in more than 100 picturesque saltwater pools dotting the deserts of New Mexico and Texas.\n\nHeaps of algae slurry fresh from the cooling tanks. Photo from Qualitas Health Inc.\n\nUsing a minimum of nutrients, along with plenty of carbon dioxide and sunshine, the algae quickly proliferates in the pools and is filtered and processed into an omega-3 oil. The company is also completing regulatory work on an algae powder high in protein and carbohydrates.\n\nIf you’ve ever eaten sushi or drunk a smoothie with a bright green tint, then you’ve already come across algae in your food, says Rebecca White, the company’s vice president of operations. She says it’s a ubiquitous, low-resource, and sustainable protein enrichment.\n\nWhite points to several milk brands that already use algae-derived omega-3s to fortify their products, including Horizon and Fairlife. Thrive Algae Oil recently received a qualified health claim from the Food and Drug Administration. Odwalla, too, is incorporating algae into products such as smoothies, juices, and snack bars.\n\n“It’s cool that people are experimenting,” says Frannie Maas, a vegan who lives in Washington, D.C. She points out that eating a sustainable, animal-free diet isn’t always easy or affordable. “It’s important to know, as a vegan, that many people aren’t in a financial position to buy meat (or) dairy alternatives. Or they don’t live in an area where they can easily get those,” Maas says. But she predicts that emerging possibilities will soon put smart, legitimate selections on everybody’s table.\n\nA Fish Out of Water\n\nThose unprepared to embrace entomophagy or accept plant-based alternatives need not bemoan a future without protein, however. Real meat also appears to be moving into a new, more sustainable age.\n\nWild Type is a San Francisco company that’s managed to grow genuine salmon meat from salmon cells. The process involves multiplying individual fish cells in baths of a nutrient- and oxygen-rich solution until they become muscle fibers and connective tissue. Though reminiscent of an Asimov novel, the process is far enough along now to produce the kind of tissue that flakes naturally after cooking. Arye Elfenbein, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, says it tastes great smoked and is visually appealing enough to be a component of sushi.\n\n“We wanted a cleaner food source to avoid the mercury, antibiotics, or pesticides you get in wild or farmed fish, but we also wanted to give people an opportunity to live a little lighter on the planet,” says Ben Friedman, Wild Type’s head of product.\n\nWild Type’s cultured salmon. Photo from FitoPardo.com/Getty Images\n\nWild Type co-founder and CEO Justin Kolbeck says the company is already working with partners in the food industry to coax the meat into an ideal shape, and he predicts Wild Type salmon will be a menu option at chain restaurants within five to 10 years.\n\n“It [was] almost unthinkable that there would be a plant-based burger at Burger King and White Castle, yet today it’s practically ubiquitous,” Kolbeck says. “I think the same goes for seafood alternatives.”"

            "content": "The cancellation of the world’s largest smartphone trade show last week amid rising coronavirus deaths has left startups around the globe with huge dents in their budgets — and little clarity about whether they will ever recoup their losses.\n\nSmall business owners say the sudden shuttering of the Mobile World Congress slated to start on Feb. 24 has left them eating costs for nonrefundable flights and hotel rooms at a time when travel to Barcelona had skyrocketed due to the show.\n\nCompanies planning to tease products at the annual Barcelona powwow have also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars building their exhibits — as well as months of man-hours used to prep for the show, sources said.\n\nRobb Henshaw, a San Francisco-based MWC veteran, said some small businesses could easily be looking at losses of $1 million or more, which was what his previous company had spent at the conference before it was acquired by Cisco.\n\n“If you want to go to Barcelona and actually have foot traffic and be seen, you’re talking a minimum quarter- million dollar to half-a-million-dollar investment for the booth and build-out,” Henshaw said.\n\n“The flights are crazy expensive — like $1,400 a person flying coach,” he added. “The hotel rooms are anywhere between $600 and $1,000 a night per person, and that’s if you’re staying well outside of the city center.”\n\n“The amount of logistics and planning that goes into preparing for that show is literally three months,” Henshaw told The Post. “It’s three months of your company’s productivity just gone.”\n\nWhile big companies will easily swallow the cost of missing MWC, widely considered the telecom industry’s Super Bowl, smaller companies plan to push for refunds, sources said.\n\nThe conference’s governing body, GSMA, pulled the plug on Feb. 12 as exhibitors like Facebook and Sony started getting cold feet in the face of the global coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people, mainly in China.\n\nSo far, GSMA has told attendees that they shouldn’t expect to see the money they spent booking booths. The group called the cancellation a “force majeure situation” and posted a document on MWC’s website showing that its insurance policy includes exceptions for events like war, national mourning and SARS outbreaks.\n\nOne telecom specialist, who asked to not be identified while his clients press MWC to issue refunds, said a number of the wireless companies he works with have spent more than 50 percent of their annual marketing budget on MWC alone, including exhibition space, building stands and staff travel.\n\n“It’s the anchor point around which these companies build their years,” he told The Post. “Now they’re at the point where they’ve made the investment and it’s like ‘now what?’ ”\n\nDave Rubie, who was planning on flying to Barcelona from Australia on behalf of his agriculture tech company Smart Shepherd, thought he was set when MWC was canceled because he had purchased travel insurance — only to be blindsided by the fine print.\n\n“As it turns out, the travel insurance had a clause in it that anything involving a disease outbreak wouldn’t be covered,” he said.\n\n“That’s money I would have normally used to do business development in my local region, or take a trip to the US,” he said.\n\nEven local execs who can zip in and out of Barcelona in a day are feeling the pinch. Patricia López, CEO of Seville-based sex tech company Myhixel, shelled out $300 per person for round-trip flights to Barcelona — a trip that would normally cost closer to $100 — only to see her plans go up in smoke.\n\n“We had a meeting with a company from the Netherlands and they had to cancel their trip,” López told The Post. The flights, hotels and conference fees ate up more than 10 percent of López’s annual marketing budget, which she said could have otherwise gone toward more business development.\n\n“It’s really, really hard for us because we’re a startup with limited funds,” she said. “The impact [this cancelation] has on small companies is much bigger than it is on huge companies.”\n\nGSMA did not respond to a request for comment, but in an e-mail sent to exhibitors obtained by industry blog Telecoms, said it was working on “a proposal” to present to exhibitors and commercial partners by the end of March."

            "content": "The new measures Israel enacted on Wednesday to ease conditions in Gaza are a significant achievement for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.\n\nSinwar, who has rarely appeared in public in recent weeks (with some rumors in Gaza suggesting that he’s fearful of an assassination attempt by Israel), had continued to exert pressure on Israel until he attained his goal.\n\nskip - Haaretz Weekly Ep. 63\n\nHaaretz Weekly Ep. 63 Haaretz\n\nThe list of measures – which Israel did not rush to publicize, in contrast to its usual trumpeting of sanctions when those are imposed – is the most far-reaching since Hamas took over the Gaza Strip by force in June 2007.\n\nThe most important item is the granting of an additional 2,000 work permits allowing Gazans to work in Israel, given to people defined as merchants. In practice, this is a fiction agreed upon by both sides.\n\nPalestinian fishermen riding a boat cast their net as birds fly off the coast of Gaza City, February 19, 2020. MOHAMMED SALEM/ REUTERS\n\nThere is no entrepreneurial campaign in Gaza, and the devastated economy there has not engendered 2,000 new and ambitious merchants overnight. Without saying so explicitly and under the guise of allowing the entry of merchants, political echelons and the defense establishment are starting to grant gradual legitimization to the idea of renewed employment of Gazans within Israel.\n\nLast year, Israel started handing out entry and work permits to 5,000 residents of the Gaza Strip, who were also termed merchants. Many of these were laborers who found work in construction, industry and agriculture. Two thousand more laborers will now join them. This easing is as vital for Gazans as air. It joins a list of other alleviating measures Hamas has obtained from Israel recently, mediated by Egyptian intelligence officials. These include the expansion of the fishing zone to 15 nautical miles from the coast, the import of large quantities of cement for construction without employing the tight supervision that was put in place after Operation Protective Edge in 2014. There was also approval given to bringing in heavy equipment that was held up by Israel for years. There was also a promise to promote, with relative urgency, large infrastructure projects.\n\nHamas is now receiving what it couldn’t extort from Israel through a year and a half of confrontations along the border fence. As reported in Haaretz last summer, there were serious deliberations among Hamas leaders regarding the continuation of mass Friday protests along the border. In incidents that erupted, mainly around these protests, more than 300 young Palestinians were killed. Thousands more were injured, with many losing limbs after being hit by Israeli sharpshooters.\n\nBreaking news and analyses in your inbox Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

The pressure did not bring about concessions by Israel or a significant easing of the situation, and led to mounting frustration with Hamas in Gaza. This led Sinwar to halt these protests, but not to completely abandon the use of violent methods. It is possible that the calculated and limited use of violent means in recent weeks, such as launching explosive devices attached to balloons as well as the sporadic firing of rockets and mortar shells (usually by rogue factions), is what ultimately brought some gains for Hamas.\n\nThis would not have happened were Israel not in the midst of an election frenzy. Hamas identified the political distress beleaguering the Netanyahu government and continued exerting pressure until it obtained these alleviating measures this week. It’s possible that the prime minister is preparing an operational surprise for Hamas, as he hinted at last week, but judging by what’s happening on the ground, that organization is so far only reaping benefits from Israel.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, shortly after the new measures took effect, there was a shooting incident along the Gaza border, east of Khan Yunis. The Israel Defense Forces spokesman reported that Islamic Jihad sharpshooters had fired into Israel and were hit by returning Israeli sharpshooter fire. Reports from Gaza indicated that one civilian was hurt by Israeli fire, without mentioning the earlier shooting from Gaza.\n\nasked Palestinians prepare to attach balloons to a gas canister before releasing it near Gaza's Bureij refugee camp, along the Israel-Gaza border fence, February 10, 2020. AFP\n\nThe coming days will show whether Hamas is ready to completely desist from using violent methods in exchange for these benefits, or whether it is indicating with a wink and nod to smaller groups that launching balloons or rockets will be tolerated. As far as is known, Israel is not demanding that Hamas aggressively impose its authority over these factions and arrest their members or stop acts of terror committed by rogue networks in the West Bank.\n\nIn an optimistic scenario, the new measures should ensure quiet up to the election on March 2. After that, the two sides will have to work on a longer-term arrangement. The IDF, which has supported easing conditions in the Strip over the last few months, continues to express optimism regarding Gaza. We’ll soon know if this is warranted."

            "content": "The first of the federal government's planned cooperative housing initiative to reach the informal sector in the country came on stream Monday as the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, commissioned the AKACARE Cooperative Housing Scheme, the Woodhill Estate, at Kuje, in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had, in his address at the Ministerial Retreat held in September 2019, declared that one of his administration's NEXT LEVEL commitments was \"to deepen access of Nigerians to affordable housing and consumer credit\".\n\nIn his keynote address at the event, Mr Fashola said the federal government's choice of cooperative associations as means to reach the informal sector in its housing development was based on their traditionally proven successes in the areas like transportation, agriculture, trade and commerce, market associations and other large groups in the informal sector.\n\nAt the event which also had in attendance the representative of the Head of Service of the Federation and the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, among other top government functionaries and dignitaries from both public and private sectors, Mr Fashola said by using cooperatives as anchor, the federal government hoped to reach the large members of the informal sector and scale up construction of houses with its multiplier effects on the economy.\n\nAccording to him, such multiplier effects on the nation's economy would include the boosting of cottage industries which make building materials like paints, doors, roofing materials, nails and electrical fittings, to mention a few, adding that the scale of construction by the associations would also ramp up employment and income for artisans who would build the houses.\n\nMr Fashola said the Ministry of Works and Housing, as the policy-making arm of the government, had assigned the responsibility of implementing the policy to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN), a parastatal of the ministry, to partner with the cooperatives, adding that the FMBN had also recorded modest successes in its partnerships with some cooperatives.\n\nNoting that such boost in employment and economy of the most vulnerable would represent Ministry of Works and Housing's contribution to President Buhari's commitment to raise a 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in a decade, Mr Fashola recalled the testimonies of artisans during his recent inspection tour of South-South road and housing projects where masons testified to earning as much as N126,000 and labourers N84,000 per month while food vendors made as much as N140,000 profit per month.\n\nThe minister, who defined cooperatives as \"an autonomous association of persons united VOLUNTARILY to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned enterprise\", pointed out that the word voluntary was critical in the formulation of government's policy of partnership with the cooperatives \"as a means of overcoming the problem of acceptability and affordability\" that has stood in the way of access to housing.\n\nHe said the importance of this stemmed from government's past experiences, investigations and observations which had revealed the existence of hundreds of thousands of unoccupied houses in major cities across the country adding, \"They are empty and unoccupied because they are either over-built, in being too big, or under-built in being too small and, therefore, unacceptable to those who need them.\"\n\nThe reason for the unacceptability, Mr Fashola further stated, was \"because in many instances no consultations took place between the builders and the consumers they build for\", adding that because of the lack of consultation and the attendant acceptability problem, the problem of affordability also creeps in.\n\n\"This is why we are undertaking a pilot scheme based on our studies to build in 34 states who provided land, what the people we consulted said they will find acceptable\", the Minister said adding, \"Our policy development team finds the voluntary nature of cooperatives very useful because members will be expected to design and build according to their needs and their income, as they find affordable\".\n\nExpressing confidence in FMBN for successful implementation of the policy, Mr Fashola said, \"As in other sectors, when cooperatives have been successful, we can point to modest successes of partnerships with FMBN with some cooperatives in the formal sector that currently has 52 housing projects under construction to deliver 4,624 units in 2020\".\n\nHe said in flagging off the policy through the commissioning of Woodhill Estate of AKACARE Cooperative Housing Scheme, government \"seeks to multiply the above number in many fold by unleashing the power of cooperatives and empower their voluntary will to act together in pursuit of the common desire to access housing and credit\".\n\nListing the requirements for the eligibility of cooperatives to include registration, acquisition of land with title and building permit from the government of the respective states where their land is located, Mr Fashola said the last requirement was instructive \"because it seeks to eliminate incidents of unapproved buildings and slums which governments later seek to demolish\".\n\nThe minister, who recalled that all the state government agencies in charge of land were briefed at the National Council launch meeting held in Abuja on November 7th 2019, added. \"The Mandate and role of the FMBN is to then provide construction funding to the cooperatives to build the houses and to provide mortgage finance to the individual members to buy the house and pay back in instalments at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent per annum\".\n\nCommending AKACARE Cooperative for embracing the NEXT LEVEL initiative of the government, Mr Fashola declared, \"As every cooperative chooses what it desires and can afford, the FMBN, representing the Federal Government of Nigeria, will be your partner, providing financial support to enable you act voluntarily to choose and build what you accept and your income can afford\".\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks the Managing Director/Chief Executive of FMBN, Ahmed Dangiwa, said under the first phase of the Woodhill Housing Estate which was being commissioned, FMBN delivered 77 housing units comprising of 40 units of 2-bedroom semi-detached bungalows and 37 units of 3-bedroom detached bungalows.\n\nClose Sign up for free

He says he's confident New Zealand can achieve eradication, and the country can farm free from this cattle disease in the future.\n\nAttempting eradication was a bold decision, with no country having attempted it before.\n\nHowever, the estimated economic impact of allowing this disease to spread, in just the first 10 years, was $1.3 billion in lost productivity in the cattle industries.\n\nAnd on top of that is the increased antibiotic use, animal welfare issues, and having to make fundamental changes to how freely we can move cattle to grass, limiting our potential industry growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has not been an easy fight, but it's one we are winning.\n\nThe independent Technical Advisory Group says that eradication is feasible. We are testing more farms and finding fewer cases.\n\nMore than 93 per cent of farms that are put under restrictions due to a risk of infection are found to be clear of disease. On average it is taking fewer than five days to put farms under restrictions when risk is identified.\n\nThe Bulk Tank Milk Surveillance programme shows us that the disease is not widespread, and that we are finding infected farms.\n\nOn average only nine farms a month are now having a \"detect\" result on this screening test, and 97 per cent of those farms are found to not be infected after on-farm testing.\n\nWe have also begun testing on a random selection of beef farms, alongside Tb testing, to assure us that the disease is not established in the beef breeding herd.\n\nThe compensation process, which was taking too long in some cases, has been greatly improved. It's more agile, has more expert advice from industry, and is getting payments done quicker. More than $127 million has now been paid out in compensation, and 90 per cent of claims lodged have been processed.\n\nPart of the reason that the programme is starting to see success has been the partnership between MPI and its industry partners DairyNZ and Beef + Lamb New Zealand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have developed meaningful ways to work together in the field, and to govern and lead the Programme from the boardroom.\n\nFarmers are contributing 32 per cent of the total cost of the eradication effort (including compensation), and the industry groups have made substantial contributions in time and resources to the programme's operations.\n\nHaving industry and farmers at the table has fundamentally improved the effort, and has shown us the way forward for future biosecurity incursions.\n\nWhile we are still working to halt the spread of the disease, and cannot ease our efforts now, we are also making sure that we can reach the next phase, which is running a long-term surveillance programme to give us confidence that we have achieved \"freedom from disease\".\n\nDamien O'Connor scanning cattle.

            "content": "The little city of Hazen, North Dakota, population 2,300, is the kind of town where farming and ranching families often have a second income from a job at a power plant or a coal mine.\n\nAs a teenager, Christie Obenauer, née Huber, frequently made the hourlong drive from Hazen to Bismarck, the state capital, to go shopping with her sister. On the way, they’d usually make a stop to run an errand for their dad, who ran Union State Bank of Hazen.\n\n“We would back up that giant Buick to the back of the old Bank of North Dakota building, they loaded it up with money, and we’d cover it up with a blanket, close the trunk, go to the mall, and come home,” Obenauer says. “That was a different time. Everyone just knew we were the Huber girls.”\n\nObenauer is the fourth generation in her family to run Union State Bank. Founded in 1908, the bank today holds $130 million in deposits and has $147 million in loans, investments, and other assets. Obenauer still sends her staff on regular trips to pick up coin and currency in Bismarck—just don’t ask her what car they drive.\n\nChristie Obenauer, president and CEO of Union State Bank of Hazen, North Dakota, meets with Matt Clarys of Western Steel Builders. By partnering with the state’s bank, Obenauer’s small bank has been able to finance several large projects in her town.\n\nThough it’s a tiny institution in a tiny city, Union State is able to do many things normally beyond the reach of a bank of its size. It served as the lead local lender for a $30.5 million medical center that opened in 2016, combining state and federal loans, another federal loan guarantee, and cash from the regional health system. Obenauer describes how her bank partnered with the medical center, Basin Electric, and a few other local employers to convert a former church into a cooperatively owned child care center that now serves 88 kids. She also notes that her bank helped finance manufactured housing for new workers attracted by the shale oil boom. The Bank of North Dakota was an instrumental secondary market to buy those mortgages, taking up the long-term risk in the way Fannie Mae helps local lenders across the country.\n\nWhile there is certainly a lot that’s unique about Hazen, Union State Bank, and Obenauer’s path to becoming a fourth-generation community banker, it is not unusual in North Dakota to find a little bank punching far above its weight. That’s just how banking works in this state, largely because of the century-old Bank of North Dakota, the only state-owned bank in the country.\n\nAll of North Dakota’s state tax and fee revenues get deposited by default into the Bank of North Dakota. Prohibited by law from competing with the private sector, it has no branches or ATMs, and other than student loans, the bank rarely originates or services loans directly to people or businesses. If you want to open an account and deposit your own money into the bank, you have to go in person to the main office in Bismarck, and you also have to be a North Dakota resident.\n\nThe Bank of North Dakota operates primarily as a bankers’ bank, partnering with local financial institutions to leverage the state’s deposits in ways designed to strengthen local banks and credit unions.\n\n“To some degree, it’s a little bit mystifying to other bankers who are in other states,” Obenauer says. “It’s an extension of who we already are. I’m only a $150 million bank with just three locations in a rural space. The Bank of North Dakota allows us to be bigger than we are. We can sell overlines or participations or we can utilize some of their programs that we wouldn’t be in a position to offer on our own. They just allow us to do big things, even if we’re small.”\n\nThe Bank of North Dakota was the first bank in the nation to write a federally guaranteed student loan, back in 1967.\n\nParticipation loans are one of the most important and the most voluminous way the Bank of North Dakota works as a bankers’ bank. In a participation loan, the loan originator covers part of the principal amount borrowed, then it brings in other lenders behind the scenes to cover the rest, and everyone shares in the interest paid on the loan. Participation loans let small banks share the risk with larger institutions, while keeping the larger institutions in the background. Most borrowers don’t know that the Bank of North Dakota is involved through a participation loan unless they ask, says Gary Petersen, chairperson for Cornerstone Banks.\n\nThat’s intentional. It allows local banks to leverage a deeper pool of money while maintaining their relationships with their clients. According to its 2018 Economic Development Report, the Bank of North Dakota made 491 commercial loans totaling $971 million and 402 agricultural loans totaling $182 million. The vast majority of those were participation loans in partnership with local financial institutions across the state.\n\n“It’s like a bankers’ bank on steroids because of all the different programs they bring to the table,” Petersen says. “You know, when I talk to my peers that are from outside North Dakota and they learn about the bank, if they haven’t heard about it already, many are fascinated by the prospect and very envious, I think in most cases, that we have this tool in our toolbox.”\n\nRick Clayburgh’s first introduction to the state-owned bank was more typical of North Dakotans today. It was when he first got a student loan. The Bank of North Dakota was the first bank in the nation to write a federally guaranteed student loan, back in 1967. The bank still has a student loan portfolio of around $1.1 billion.\n\n“I think there are a lot of people here in North Dakota that the Bank of North Dakota has touched through student loans,” Clayburgh says. “But I would venture to say, unless they had some understanding of the banking system, I don’t think most people would know that it was a state-owned bank, in particular, or that it was unique. It was just an institution that was helping them with their education.”\n\nClayburgh went on to work in banking, and eventually came to work at the North Dakota Bankers Association in 2005, where he is now president and CEO. He long ago lost count of the number of other state bankers’ associations and other colleagues from outside of North Dakota who have asked him about working with a state-owned bank.\n\n“It works here because it’s been allowed to operate like a bank,” says Clayburgh.\n\nElected officials allow the Bank of North Dakota to take some risks, he says. “But that’s all done with open eyes by our elected officials, and working in conjunction with our local institutions.”\n\nDespite its risk-taking, the Bank of North Dakota earned a net income of $159 million in 2018, and has had positive net income every year as far back as 1966. It currently has $7 billion in assets—twice the amount in 2008—and in 2018 it paid its billionth dollar back to the state.\n\nThough it’s a tiny institution in a tiny city, Union State Bank in Hazen, North Dakota, is able to do many things normally beyond the reach of a bank of its size. It served as the lead local lender for the $30.5 million Sakakawea Medical Center that opened in 2016.\n\nWith that kind of ubiquity in the state’s economy, the Bank of North Dakota has touched many lives, both for good and bad. When a state agency needs to finance a militarized crackdown on Dakota Access Pipeline protesters, for example, it goes to the Bank of North Dakota. It also shouldn’t be ignored that the state-owned bank was originally created by and for a settler population that benefited from the violent theft of Sioux tribal lands.\n\nIn another respect, the bank has helped North Dakota’s economy live up to higher ideals, welcoming newcomers fleeing violence and warfare in other countries.\n\nFowzia Adde arrived in the United States in the late 1990s as a 19-year-old refugee from Somalia, landing alone in Washington, D.C. Her mother, father, and siblings would arrive a few months later. Like so many new Americans before and since, Adde found work as a 7-Eleven cashier and housekeeper.\n\nBut she managed to keep in touch with the friends she had made in her refugee camp prior to being resettled in the U.S., and they ended up being resettled in Fargo.\n\n“They were calling me,” Adde says. “How much do you pay for rent? I said I pay $1,200. How much do you get paid? This much. What is going on? Get out of there, we are only paying $500 and we are getting paid the same as you. Come here, work one job and pay your rent.”\n\nIn Fargo, she found work in a wire factory, making components for motorcycles. But by 2002, she was one of a dozen people from Somalia, Latin America, Vietnam, or the Middle East who were unhappy working on the same production line in what felt like dead-end jobs. Like so many immigrants before and since, they wanted to start their own businesses.\n\n“We were unhappy. We started wondering what’s going on, in North Dakota, that there are no resources for new American entrepreneurs,” Adde says. “There is no organization that supports them.”\n\nAfter talking about it on work breaks and weekend meetings, by 2003 the group founded what is now the Immigrant Development Center, and Adde became executive director. One day in 2018, two young men came into Adde’s office, one originally from Iraq and one from Jordan. They were already running their grocery, F-M International Foods, but they were looking for assistance.\n\n“They came to us and said we want to pay as much as we are paying right now [in rent], but we want to own everything,” Adde says.\n\nAdde helped the pair draft a business plan and apply for a loan, which they got, for $250,000 from Cornerstone Banks—which included a participation loan from the Bank of North Dakota.\n\nMany public bank campaigners see public banking specifically as a way to divest their local tax dollars out of banks that helped finance oil and gas pipelines.\n\n“They bought the building, bought the equipment, and they pay less now than what they were paying before,” Adde says.\n\nIt’s about once or twice a year Adde says she works with a client who ends up getting a loan from Cornerstone Banks, which often brings in the state bank. As of the fall of 2019, the bank had around $100 million in active loans with the participation of the Bank of North Dakota.\n\n“They’re a good friend of ours,” Adde says of Cornerstone.\n\nAt a fundamental level, the most important thing that the Bank of North Dakota does is listen to local financial institutions and respond to their needs relatively quickly, often by simply building on its existing functions and programs.\n\nTake manufactured housing. A few years ago, Obenauer’s Union State Bank in Hazen started getting more and more requests for financing to build and purchase manufactured homes for new oil industry workers.\n\n“You cannot just live in your car or live in a camper and think you’re going to survive our winters. It just doesn’t work that way,” Obenauer says. “These are homes that can get put up much more quickly, which is what we did, but I didn’t have a secondary market that loved manufactured homes.”\n\nEven though the mortgages for manufactured homes were individually small, a sudden high volume of them in a relatively brief period of time can become a major cash drain on a little bank, especially since those mortgages can last as long as 30 years. That’s a long time to wait for somebody to pay you back.\n\n“So I called the BND and said, I need your help, will you buy these from me if I’m originating them?” Obenauer says.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association, was the federal government’s solution to incentivize small community lenders to make 30-year, fixed-rate home mortgages to millions of families, and between 1934 and 1962, it worked for around 11 million families. Fannie Mae still serves as a secondary buyer of mortgages from banks, credit unions, and, increasingly, non-bank lenders—essentially giving lenders back the loan principal and most of the interest for which they otherwise would have waited up to 30 years to be repaid.\n\nThe Bank of North Dakota was already serving as a secondary purchaser of conventional single-family home mortgages for North Dakota. It was a natural extension of their business to become the secondary market for manufactured home mortgages from Obenauer’s bank and any other local North Dakota lender.\n\nThe Bank of North Dakota helped subsidize the child care co-op in Hazen through its Partnerships in Assisting Community Expansion, or PACE program, which allows local economic development agencies to leverage matching dollars from the bank for key projects: equipment, working capital, manufacturing facilities, office space, child care facilities, medical facilities, and also affordable multi-family housing. The Greater Fargo-Moorhead Economic Development Corporation, for example, did 18 PACE deals in 2019, up from 15 in 2018, according to chief innovation officer John Machacek.\n\nThe PACE program started out in the mid-1990s as a job creation tool because the state couldn’t create enough jobs to keep people from moving away. Once the shale oil boom picked up, however, job creation wasn’t so much the problem as was helping every other part of the economy keep pace. So the Bank of North Dakota worked with state legislators to expand the program to include deals without a job creation requirement (called “FlexPACE”), so long as the local economic development agency provided matching dollars and the recipients submitted yearly data on its impact to the North Dakota Department of Commerce.\n\nEvery so often, when its local partners make clear it’s necessary, the Bank of North Dakota asks state legislators for authorization to expand its annual allocation of PACE program dollars, which come out of the bank’s annual profits.\n\nUnion State Bank President Christie Obenauer, right, visits the Hazen child care center that her bank invested in. Her bank partnered with local employers to convert a former church into a cooperatively owned child care center that now serves 88 kids. Funding from the Bank of North Dakota “allows us to be bigger than we are,” she says.\n\nEvery PACE program loan is a participation loan. In 2017, the state legislature increased the subsidy cap on the matching dollar amount for each loan, and made some other tweaks to the law. As a result, there were 129 subsidized loans for a total of $55 million made under the PACE program in 2018, up from 90 loans totaling $29 million in 2017.\n\nThe PACE program’s growth and evolution is a microcosm of how the Bank of North Dakota “evolves with our own evolution [as lenders] and with the state’s own evolution,” Obenauer says. “What the BND does so well is to be responsive to the concerns that they hear and develop programs that are specifically responsive to the needs that we have as lenders out here taking care of our producers, or our customers and our communities.”\n\nAcross the country, campaigns to create more state-, city- or county-owned banks—also known as “public banks”—have emerged over the past few years in places that could not be more different than North Dakota, in terms of geography, demographics, or politics. Organizers in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, and other cities in California made key strides in 2019, banding together to overcome opposition from mainstream banks and pass a bill to make it easier for cities and counties in California to charter their own banks.\n\n“What we’re really looking for is a tool to help us have that just transition that is moving the whole community, the whole society from an extractive economy to a regenerative economy,” says Sylvia Chi, a lawyer in the East Bay Area who co-chaired the legislative committee of the California Public Banking Alliance. “I see public banks as a way to do that because of the public nature of it and the accountability to the people that’s built into the structure; it should have the values that are missing in the status quo.”\n\nThose California organizers are now back at their local level working with local legislators and agencies to press forward with chartering municipal and county-owned banks.\n\n“The end goal we see locally is more direct and accelerated investment in these things like affordable housing, renewable energy, small business,” says Kurtis Wu, who co-founded the San Francisco Public Banking Coalition.\n\nNew York state legislators have a public banking bill in the works for the 2020 session that would make it easier in that state for local governments to charter public banks, and a local public banking campaign is gaining steam in New York City. Elected officials in New Jersey and Michigan are pushing for state-owned banks, and a gubernatorial candidate in West Virginia has a public bank in his campaign platform.\n\nPublic banking campaigns have looked to the Bank of North Dakota for inspiration, particularly given its origins in a brief period of electoral control by North Dakota socialists a hundred years ago, which resulted in the state creating its own bank and its own grain elevator. Some activists are looking to the Bank of North Dakota explicitly as a model to emulate or build upon.\n\n“Our coalition definitely envisions [a San Francisco public bank] being a bankers’ bank so it can work with local community banks and expand lending capacity and help out the little banks,” Wu says. “It’s a vision here, but it exists in North Dakota.”\n\nIt’s not the first time outsiders have expressed such an interest in the Bank of North Dakota as well as other public banking models abroad. Some public bank campaign organizers first started pushing the idea a decade ago, in the days of Occupy Wall Street.\n\n“What we’re really looking for is a tool to help us have that just transition that is moving the whole community, the whole society from an extractive economy to a regenerative economy.”\n\nHowever, there also are some things that the Bank of North Dakota has done or supported that those organizers oppose. The bank has played a crucial role in the state’s fossil fuel booms over the last century, most recently the shale oil boom from 2006-2015.\n\nThrough its participation loans, the Bank of North Dakota supported local financial institutions to provide financing not only for the drilling and fracking in the western end of the state, but also for the machinery, manufacturing, logistics and other ancillary industries across the state. Hazen’s new medical center, as well as the child care co-op and the manufactured housing that Union State Bank started financing a few years ago, were all part of responding to the waves of out-of-state transplants seeking shale oil jobs in western North Dakota.\n\nIn other states, many public bank campaigners see public banking specifically as a way to divest their local tax dollars out of banks that helped finance oil and gas pipelines. But as the primary banker for its fellow state agencies, the Bank of North Dakota also provided a line of credit for the North Dakota Emergency Commission to ramp up its law enforcement militarization against those protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.\n\n“We’re not making a social statement on environmental issues or societal issues,” says Eric Hardmeyer, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota since 2001. “Our job is to finance economic development and state agencies. Our economic development efforts right now are concentrated on agriculture and energy, and energy is all sorts. It’s fossil fuels, wind, solar, the whole gamut. We don’t pick winners or losers.”\n\nWhat public bank campaigners elsewhere want most of all is bigger and deeper than just divesting from fossil fuels, and they see in the example set by Bank of North Dakota a powerful means to that end. They want a world with a more decentralized financial sector, with more local lenders they can more easily hold accountable for meeting real human needs, like affordable housing and living wage jobs, thriving small business, affordable child care and accessible health care. They’re tired of big banks running the show and cherry-picking which of these needs they’ll meet just enough to fulfill their obligations under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act—which current federal bank regulators want to gut even further.\n\n“There’s just not a lot of homegrown banks anymore,” Chi says. “We haven’t had great success in persuading local community banks that this could really help them, but we’re still trying to make that argument and persuade them that public banks could really help them stick around and to provide services to their customers and keep local economies strong.”\n\nAt their peak in the mid 1980s, there were more than 14,000 banks in the United States. The fall of interstate banking walls in the 1980s, technological progress, and other economic forces have left the U.S. economy with only about 5,200 banks today, according to the FDIC, even as bank deposits continue growing every year. With a population of 330 million, that’s one bank for every 63,000 people. North Dakota has one bank for every 10,000 people, the lowest ratio of any state.\n\n“One of the most-heard talking points against a public bank is it will hurt local banks,” Wu says. “But it’s the exact opposite—we’ve seen it in action.” Indeed, the state with the nation’s only public bank has the highest number of banks per person in the U.S.“Our coalition believes it’s a direct result of the Bank of North Dakota acting like a bankers’ bank, being able to expand lending capacity, essentially expanding the local banking sector,” Wu says."

            "content": "Had history happened differently, there might be more than one tricolour on display when Ireland play England in Twickenham this coming Sunday. But if the horizontal green, white, and red flag never took off on our neighbouring island, it may be partly due to an event that will have taken place in another part of London exactly 200 years ago on that day.\n\nThe uncovering of the so-called “Cato Street Conspiracy” thwarted a plan to wipe out the entire British cabinet of the time, including its Dublin-born foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh, widely hated by then on both sides of the Irish Sea.\n\nHis might even have been one of the heads that the plotters intended to display on Westminster Bridge afterwards, en route to seizing various strategic buildings and declaring a republic. Alas for them, the dinner all cabinet members were supposed to be attending on February 23rd, 1820, was fictional: invented as a trap by a government spy who had infiltrated the group. Police and soldiers instead raided the loft in Cato Street where the plotters had assembled. And it was five of the would-be assassins who ended up losing their heads. Thousands attended their executions in May, some paying up to three guineas for a good view.\n\nThe leader of the conspiracy, one Arthur Thistlewood, was stoical at the end, speaking from the dock like an English Robert Emmet. “Albion is still in chains of slavery,” he said. “I quit it without regret. I shall be consigned to the grave, and my body will be immured beneath the soil whereon I first drew breath. My only sorrow is that the soil should be a theatre for slaves, for cowards and for despots. My motives will hereafter be justly appreciated.”\n\nBecause the plotters were squashed so thoroughly, it is not known how widespread their support had ever been. But it was an age of unrest in England, as the collapse of agriculture after the Napoleonic Wars, the dire poverty of industrial cities, and the lingering influence of the French and American revolutions all combined to produce a series of uprisings.\n\nThistlewood had already been among those involved in the Spa Field Riots of 1816, when an English republican flag made its first public appearance. Like the modern Hungarian one, it comprised horizontal bars of green, white, and red: green being considered the colour of the common man.\n\nThe years following brought the march of the “Blanketeers” in Manchester, Derbyshire’s “Pentrich Rising”, and – most seriously – the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 when, again in Manchester, cavalry charged a mass public meeting, killing 18 people and injuring hundreds. It was his role in defending such acts of repression that earned the aforementioned Dubliner poetic infamy, via Shelley’s The Masque of Anarchy: “I met with murder on the way –/He had a mask like Castlereagh.”\n\nBut there was also a strong and consistent Irish presence among the revolutionaries. Although the ringleaders of Cato Street were English, and although the extent of their organisation is obscure, one modern historian has suggested that “the London-Irish community” was generally sympathetic, along with various trade societies, and pockets of the industrialised north. Events in Ireland 20 years earlier were a continuing influence too, and not just via those who had emigrated from here. For a time in the late 1790s and early 1800s, there had even been a Society of United Englishman, centred in and around Yorkshire and inspired by the Irish model.\n\nThe English version didn’t leave as big a mark on history, but some of its ideals and sympathisers resurfaced in 1814 with the Society of Spencean Philanthopists, named in posthumous tribute to Thomas Spence, a Newcastle-born radical, who had died in that year after spending much of his adult life in prison.\n\nSpence advocated overthrow of the aristocracy, public ownership of all land, and universal suffrage for both sexes, among other reforms. He may also, as far back as 1794, have been the first English person to use the phrase “Rights of Man”. Indeed, he was ahead of his time in promoting “The Rights of Infants” too, in an essay of that title.\n\nThe unfortunate Thistlewood was his ardent disciple.\n\nAnd one of the reasons the Cato Conspiracy is hard to quantify may be accidentally commemorated by thousands of rugby fans in London this weekend.\n\nAs a biography of Spence explains, he had never liked the idea of having a centralised radical body but instead encouraged “the formation of small groups that could meet in local public houses”."

            "content": "LONDON, United Kingdom – Britain's government on Wednesday, February 19 faced a backlash over its new post-Brexit immigration plans, which are designed to cut \"cheap labor from Europe\" in favor of high-skilled English speakers and boosting the homegrown workforce.\n\nCritics of the proposed points-based system, due to start on January 1, 2021, said the new measures could cause staff shortages in sectors heavily reliant on foreign workers.\n\nHealth and social care, construction, hospitality, and food and drink firms could be worst affected, warned the Confederation of British Industry, which represents employers.\n\nIndustry and unions also voiced fears about the lack of provision for low-paid workers, including in agriculture, where seasonal workers would not meet new thresholds.\n\n\"Firms know that hiring from overseas and investing in the skills of their workforce and new technologies is not an 'either or' choice – both are needed to drive the economy forward,\" said CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn.\n\nBut interior minister Priti Patel dismissed suggestions of a negative impact on the UK economy, urging businesses to plug any shortfalls with local hires.\n\n\"It's about time businesses started to invest in people in this country,\" she told Sky News television.\n\n\"We have over 8 million people – that is 20% of the workforce – aged between 16 and 64 that are economically inactive right now.\"\n\n'Taking back control'\n\nThe plans, which Patel called \"firm and fair,\" are the biggest change to immigration policy in 50 years and will go before parliament, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has a comfortable majority.\n\nThey were billed as \"taking back control\" of Britain's borders and reducing immigration – both key demands of anti-EU campaigners in the divisive Brexit debate.\n\nEffectively, the new measures will make it easier for more qualified, English-speaking workers to get visas, and harder for low-skilled migrants to do so.\n\nBut the Conservative government was accused of failing to assess the economic impact, even after a report that said it would have \"zero effect\" on boosting the homegrown workforce.\n\nThe main opposition Labor party said some sectors' reliance on foreign workers would force the government to make numerous exceptions, rendering the new rules \"meaningless.\"\n\nIts home affairs spokesman Diane Abbott called it a \"salary threshold system,\" which would affect the already hard-pressed state-run National Health Service and social care sector.\n\nHer opposite number at the smaller Liberal Democrats, Christine Jardine, said the policy was \"based on xenophobia, not the social and economic needs of our country.\"\n\nBritain left the EU after 47 years of membership on January 31. EU rules are still in place until the end of the year as London and Brussels thrash out a new trade deal.\n\nBut Jardine and others warned that 10 months was not enough time for businesses to prepare for the end to free movement of EU nationals to other member states.\n\nPoints system\n\nThe plans do not affect more than 3.2 million EU citizens who have applied to stay in Britain under the official settlement scheme.\n\nThe proposals require each foreign worker to earn 70 points to be eligible and a set number of points for each qualification or skill.\n\nA maximum 20 points are awarded for prospective migrants who will earn at least £25,600 ($33,325 or 30,820 euros) and no points for those who will make the required minimum of £20,480.\n\nTwenty points also go to people with an \"appropriate skill level\" and another 20 for those who speak English \"at required level.\"\n\nBritain's current salary threshold for skilled migrants is £30,000.\n\nPeople who have jobs \"in a shortage qualification\" will also earn 20 points, and either 10 or 20 points for doctorate degrees in various fields.\n\n\"Applicants will be able to 'trade' characteristics such as their specific job offer and qualifications against a lower salary,\" the government proposal says. – Rappler.com"
