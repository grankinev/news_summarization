            "content": "Stefan eefting is, as he puts it, “a long-lasting guy” in the shipping industry. He started as an apprentice engineer in a German shipyard in 1984, and now he's a senior vice president at MAN Energy Solutions, a firm whose engines power every second vessel on the deep seas. Over the course of Eefting's career, he's watched ship engines grow from massive steel contraptions to epically huge ones: The 100,000-horsepower monsters in today's cargo ships are five or six times the size of a house. And for decades, the vast majority of them have ingested heavy fuel oil—the leftover dregs of petroleum distillation, a product so viscous it's practically a solid at room temperature. “Like chewing gum,” Eefting says. “You have to heat it to 140 or 150 degrees Celsius to even load it into the engine.”\n\nHeavy fuel oil burns thick and dirty, throwing off oxides of nitrogen and sulfur and producing more carbon emissions than almost any other fossil fuel. But it's cheaper than anything else on the market. When fuel is your industry's greatest cost—and when your industry guzzles 300 million metric tons of it a year—heavy oil is practically the only choice on the menu.\n\nSee more from The Climate Issue | April 2020. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nThat calculation changed, however, on January 1, when a new international regulation mandating low-sulfur fuel kicked in. Ship owners must now either install devices to scrub sulfur out of their heavy fuel oil exhaust or buy cleaner, more expensive fuel—at $600 or $700 a ton, compared to $400 a ton for heavy fuel oil. And that rule is just a foretaste of a massive transformation that is bearing down on Eefting's industry.\n\nSince the 1990s, ship owners have come under intense pressure to pollute the planet less. Container ships are indispensable to trade, and there's no greener mode of transport to move a freshly riveted pair of jeans from China to the US. But the world's 90,000 or so cargo ships contribute between 2 percent and 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions—more than the share contributed by Canada or Germany.\n\nWhile the sulfur cap is hitting shippers now, the far more daunting and impressive target is 30 years away. By 2050, the United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stipulated, the shipping industry's total emissions must be at least half of what they were in 2008. That goal is even more ambitious than it might sound. Trade will continue to grow even as 2050 approaches, says Johannah Christensen, the managing director of the nonprofit Global Maritime Forum. There will be many more ships at sea, making many more journeys, than there were in 2008. “What that translates to is actually an 85 percent reduction in emissions intensity per ship.”\n\nMeeting the deadline will require the industry to spend as much as $1.4 trillion on new fuel research and production, rejigged supply chains, and a revamped fleet—and no one even knows which solutions will work. The ambition, Christensen says, is “like a moon shot.”\n\nIn some ways, it's easier to decarbonize shipping than, say, automobiles or cement. The number of cargo ships in the world is small enough for them to be individually tracked, and they live so much of their lives in public—being inspected in one international port or another—that they can't slyly break rules the way a cement plant in a corrupt country might. Further, the ships are already regulated by a central authority: the IMO. The nature of this industry—in which ship owners routinely register their vessels under the flags of small countries with lax regulations—also means that the IMO is the rare forum where island nations threatened by rising seas hold significant sway. “Depending on the day you look at it, the Marshall Islands is the second- or third-largest flag register in the world,” says Bryan Comer, a senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation. “And they were instrumental in making the moral argument for reducing emissions at the IMO. If they'd had their way, in fact, they'd have wanted a 100 percent cut, and much before 2050.”\n\nThe WIRED Guide to Climate Change The world is getting warmer, the weather is getting worse. Here's everything you need to know about what humans can do to stop wrecking the planet.\n\nEven so, it's an unusual challenge for an industry to adopt an emissions target while having no clear notion of the technologies that will get it there. Borrowing ideas from other sectors isn't practical. Batteries are out. A container ship crossing the Atlantic would need so many batteries that it would have no room left for containers. Nuclear power, too, is dead in the water—“for political reasons,” says Simon Bennett, the deputy secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping. “The idea of foreign ships coming into your port with a nuclear reactor on board—that just won't be acceptable.”\n\nThe solution most immediately at hand, liquefied natural gas, emits less carbon dioxide than fuel oil, and ship engines can be retrofitted fairly easily to burn it. But carbon emissions from liquefied natural gas are only about 30 percent less than from heavy fuel oil. What's more, the primary component of liquefied natural gas, methane, is highly prone to “slip,” or leak. Atmospheric methane traps 86 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. At best, says Eefting, liquid natural gas is only a temporary answer—an intermediate station on a zero-carbon pathway.\n\nThe fuels with more long-term promise are ammonia and hydrogen, which, when burned, release no carbon emissions at all. MAN plans to deliver its first ammonia engine in 2024. But there's still plenty to be figured out: To be truly green, these fuels will themselves have to be manufactured with no carbon footprint—something the IMO can't regulate. Ammonia production is one of the most carbon-intensive processes in industrial chemistry and is the subject of its own slogging race for sustainable modifications. Meanwhile, ships and ports will have to devise new ways of handling and storing ammonia, given how toxic it is to humans. “Plus, you have to remember,” Eefting says, “ammonia stinks very much.” Hydrogen, for its part, is highly flammable and would require huge, special tanks. “Its molecules are so small that they can leak out of virtually anything,” Eefting adds. “And you need to compress it or cool it to minus-253 degrees Celsius to have a decent energy density.”"

            "content": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he is going to speak with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis about whether to allow two Holland America cruise ships, one with four dead and 200 passengers and crew having had flu-like symptoms, to dock.\n\nWhile never explicitly saying what he plans to tell DeSantis, who has raised concerns about allowing the ships into port, Trump said, \"I am going to do what is right, not only for us but for humanity.\"\n\nHolland America's MS Zaandam and MS Rotterdam cruise ships – one with ill people on board – have crossed the Panama Canal and are headed to Florida. But whether the coronavirus-infected ship and its sister vessel will be able to dock has been in question.\n\nHolland America transferred healthy passengers to the Rotterdam, which met the Zaandam with additional supplies, staff and test kits last week. The two ships have remained together for the rest of the journey.\n\nThe Zaandam began its South American voyage from Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 and was originally scheduled to end the sailing in San Antonio, Chile, March 21.\n\nWilliam Burke, chief maritime officer of Carnival Corp., which owns Holland America Line, said Tuesday during a Broward County Commission meeting broadcast live on Vimeo that Port Everglades has become the ships' \"port of last resort.\"\n\nBurke said the company intends to treat those who are sick on the ship unless things progress to the point where that is no longer possible.\n\nWhile nine people on Holland America's Zaandam have tested positive for coronavirus, it is likely many more aboard the ship in limbo are infected.\n\n\"We're assuming people who get sick have COVID,\" Burke said.\n\nBefore the commission met Tuesday, plans for docking were criticized.\n\nLocal officials and DeSantis rebuked the plans. The governor said he had been in contact with the Coast Guard and the White House.\n\nDeSantis said it would be “a mistake” to bring the cruise ship passengers into South Florida for treatment because the state already has a high, and growing, number of coronavirus infections. He said hospital beds need to be saved for residents and not “foreign nationals.”\n\nBut Trump expressed sympathy about the ordeal of passengers and crew who have been denied entry to ports in several nations.\n\n\"There are people who are sick … and we don't want to be like they will be ghost ships,\" Trump said. He noted the plight of a cruise ship that he said wandered across Asia \"that went from port to port – nobody would take it – but the meantime you had people that are dying on the ship or at least very sick, but they are dying the ship.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear what cruise ship Trump had in mind, but Princess Cruises' Diamond Princess ended a trip in Yokohama, Japan, in February with passengers quarantined as the virus spread. Five people who were on board have since died.\n\nIn saying he would speak to DeSantis, Trump said, \"these are two very big ships and they have a lot of people, so I am going to be speaking to the governor.\"\n\nOnly 11 people total have been tested on the Zaandam, with nine rapid tests coming back positive. There are around 200 rapid tests available on the ship, which sometimes result in false-negatives, according to Burke.\n\nFour elderly passengers on the Zaandam died, though the causes of death have not been disclosed. As of Tuesday, 83 guests and 117 crew members had reported flu-like symptoms. Symptoms of the flu and coronavirus are similar. The COVID-19 coronavirus has sickened more than 855,000 people and killed nearly 42,00 worldwide as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nErik Elvejord, spokesperson for Holland America Line, said on Tuesday only 14 guests and one crew member were still showing symptoms. That means \"no more symptoms,\" Elvejord said in an email. \"For example, if they had a cough or fever, they no longer have it.\"\n\nAll passengers remain in isolation, he said.\n\nAndrea Bergmann Anderson, a passenger on the Zaandam, told USA TODAY that on Monday, the ship was scheduled to anchor near San Andres Island, but instead carried on. A plane was to bring in medical supplies and medically evacuate two passengers but was denied permission to land by the Colombian government, she said."

            "content": "The Mercy Class Hospital Ships need to be recapitalized ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWith America’s two aged hospital ships taking center stage in America’s response to the Coronavirus Pandemic, savvy navalists are eager to exploit this unmatched opportunity to recapitalize America’s hospital ship fleet. But what should America’s next hospital ships look like?\n\nAmerica has several viable options to replace the aging and imperfect Mercy Class hospital ships. There are plenty of vessels and established design that are ready to help America project biomedical support forward.\n\nHow To Improve The Mercy Class?\n\nThe Mercy class was a product of the 1980s, when war planners envisioned massive conventional conflict. As such, the ships were super-sized. And while the prospect of massive casualties from conventional conflict cannot be denied, the Mercy class is simply too big for the job.\n\nCertainly, the medical support offered aboard each Mercy class hospital ship is unparalleled. The dozen operating rooms, a 1,000-bed hospital facility and assorted other complex biomedical goodies make for an incredible floating medical asset. But, in actual operations, the thousand hospital beds aboard each ship are needed very, very rarely. More often than not, the Mercy class hospital ships are sent out, manned to staff only a quarter of the available medical beds aboard ship.\n\nComplicating matters, the ships are too big for the available maritime infrastructure. Aside from the fact that the Mercy class hospital ships are some of the more maladroit vessels afloat, easily buffeted by winds and currents, the old modified oil tankers are also unable to fit into most harbors. Even if they do manage to squeeze into the few harbors able to accept them, it is often even harder to find a berth capable of accepting the enormous vessels.\n\nIf the Mercy class hospital ships are unable to tie up to a pier, the ships struggle to accept patients. With no well deck, boats must maneuver alongside the hulking tanker, subjecting potential patients to a potentially dangerous transfer. On the upper deck, the hospital ships have a single helicopter spot—with no hangar—that is unable to accept all the rotary wing platforms in America’s maritime arsenal.\n\nAnother weakness—that will become a focus as the COVID-19 deployments progress—is that the ships are unable to easily accommodate infectious or contaminated patients.\n\nWhat Are The Options?\n\nLPD Flight II ships might make good floating hospitals ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOne interesting option for a modern hospital ship would be the repurposing of an LPD Flight II Navy design. A cheaper variant of the existing San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious transport dock, these big 25,000-ton ships, if dedicated to a hospital role, can merge a right-sized ship with a high-end hospital, a well deck (where small craft can sail into the ship to load and off-load) and an enormous flight deck. As a derivative of a survivable warship, capabilities to safely handle infectious or contaminated victims can easily be built into the base design.\n\nThe only problem is cost. LPD Flight II ships are projected to cost about $1.8 billion dollars apiece.\n\nA second option is to explore smaller ships—practically floating ambulances—built along similar lines as the old PCE[R] escort patrol craft of World War II. These little 185-foot, 57-bed floating ambulances could be built in numbers and used in a wide array of situations. But small ships come with their own particular challenges—they are unstable in even moderate seas, have limited medical resources, and cannot be sustained at sea for long periods of time.\n\nA third option can come from modified mid-sized merchant ships. While not derived from a military lineage, modern mid-sized merchant ships are stable in high sea states, relatively fast, maneuverable, and can be easily modified. Some design proposals offer large flight decks, capable of accepting V-22 Ospreys or other heavy helicopters. Big and stable enough to safely accommodate high-tech davits needed launch and recover small craft with personnel aboard, a wide range of merchant platforms have potential to serve as modern floating hospitals. Larger variants can carry almost the same medical capabilities as the Mercy class, packaging those massive biomedical resources in a far smaller platform. Conversion costs are reasonable as well, with some companies proposing conversions for under $200 million dollars.\n\nConversions might seem the best, most cost-effective option, but there are few U.S.-made hulls that would suit. That is a problem; even in the best of times and with the best of justifications, Congress is loath to fund any conversion of foreign vessels for naval service.\n\nThat obstacle might make a merchant conversion a non-starter. But the unique circumstances posed by the Coronavirus Pandemic offer an unparalleled opportunity for America’s shipbuilding industry. Though building mid-sized merchant ships in the United States has long been seen as a costly non-starter, the epic sortie of America’s hospital ship fleet may offer just enough of a justification for Congress—if asked—to fund the domestic construction of mid-sized merchant ships—future hospital ships—in a U.S. shipyard. This last, dramatic mission of America’s aged hospital ships is an opportunity the Navy—and potentially the Department of Transportation—must waste no time to exploit."

He said this is in addition to any further dates as may be reviewed from time to time.\n\nThe NIMASA director general also pointed out that all passengers and crew members must fill the ‘Self Reporting Form’ as prescribed by Nigerian Port Health Authorities adding that Port Health Officers shall carry out thermal screening of all passengers and crew members on board ship, noting that until clearance is given by the PHO, no passenger and or crew member would be allowed ashore.\n\nIt would be recalled that in the fight against the deadly COVID-19, NIMASA recently donated 20 ventilators as well as six fast intervention vessels to facilitate transport logistics support in the maritime sector. The agency also donated four fully equipped new Ambulances, four Hilux and four 36 sitter coaster buses to facilitate land based logistics in the Federal Capital Territory, Lagos, Delta, Rivers, Cross River and Kaduna states along with cash donations to some of the states who have reported cases of the pandemic.\n\nKindly Share This Story:"

The 30 percent illegal charges cannot be traced but the 55 percent traceable arbitrary payment should be dealt with to reduce the cost of clearance.”\n\nIn his submission, former Special assistant to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Mr. Leke Oyewole, told Vanguard Maritime Report that Nigerian ports remain the cheapest in the world going by official charges. Oyewole said that inefficiency and corrupt practices were the reasons for the increased cost of cargo clearance.\n\nREAD ALSOBlaming FG for coronavirus spread insensitive – NATBO\n\nHe explained that going by the official tariffs, Nigeria remains very cheap adding that some uncertainties like ship security and safety add up to the cost currently being experienced at the ports.\n\nHe said: “I will almost say that the Nigerian ports are one of the cheapest ports in the world not only in Africa or West Africa. Of a truth, certain corrupt practices and inefficiencies have led to importers to pay more than they should have ordinarily paid. Going by the tariffs, Nigeria is a very cheap port but because the ship is coming to an unsafe zone, they charge more for bringing the cargoes to Nigeria.\n\n“And because of the congestion at the ports, the ships stay longer than they should have ordinarily stayed and they will also transfer that cost to the importers. When the cargoes are discharged, the process of clearance is very cumbersome, ranging from locating the container to going through the long room of the Customs Service. Then arranging for transport to take your cargo out of the port is another issue entirely, these are all added costs that will eventually make the importers say the Nigerian ports are the most expensive.\n\n“But going by what government has put in place, the Nigerian ports are the cheapest. So what we need to do is to address those bottlenecks here and there so that we have a free flow of cargo from the ports.”\n\nIn his reaction, the Chairman of the Port Consultative Council, PCC, Otunba Kunle Folarin, told Vanguard Maritime Report that the port charges are determined by the services rendered by the operators of the ports. Folarin also said that in Nigerian ports, cargo operations takes about 60 percent of the port cost adding that these charges are not within the control of the Nigerian Ports Authority.\n\nAccording to Folarin, this 60 percent of port charges includes stevedoring cost, haulage cost, terminal handling charges, shipping companies handling charges and trucking are all cargo related.\n\nHe explained that the only thing that is domiciled with the Nigerian Ports is harbour dues which include pilotage and towage which government has control over. “If the shipping companies charge a higher freight on cargoes coming to Nigeria, would you blame that on Nigerian Ports”? he queried.\n\nExplaining further, Folarin said that shipping companies are key players in every port environment just as other private operators like the haulage contractors, adding: “when you say Nigerian ports are more expensive than other ports in the sub-region, you need to find out who are the people rendering what services”.\n\nRecall that the NPA had denied that Nigerian ports are the costliest and most unfriendly Port to do business along the West African coast. In a statement by the General Manager Corporate and Strategic Communications of NPA, Engr. Adams Jatto, the NPA emphatically stated that it does not charge the highest tariffs in West Africa.\n\nAccording to him, in May 2019, Messers Crown Agents, who were commissioned by the Authority with the support of UK Aid produced the result of an assessment which revealed that it is cheaper to berth general and container vessels in Nigerian ports than in Ghana and Togo.\n\nSpecifically, he stated: “While it costs $94,567.63 VAT inclusive to berth a general cargo vessel with GRT of 26,770, LOA at 196m and cargo of 14,100 MT in Nigerian ports for instance, ports in Ghana and Togo charge $217,879.07 and $120, 357.58 exclusive of VAT for the same types of cargo respectively. Similarly, while the Authority charges $108, 806.90 VAT inclusive on a container vessel with 39,906 Gross Registered Tonnage,GRT, LOA of 261m carrying 172×20 and 139×40 containers, ports in Ghana and Togo charge $117,906.58 and $128,406.94 exclusive of VAT respectively.\n\n“The Authority would also want to reiterate that apart from towage dues, which were reviewed to cover the cost of providing the service in 2015, our tariffs have remained the same since 1993. This is also in spite of the erroneous inclusion of stevedoring charges, which is collected by Terminal Operators as the Authority’s component. Costs like freight rates and terminal handling charges are components outside the purview of the Nigerian Ports Authority, which has no powers to regulate economic activities at the ports.”\n\nKindly Share This Story:"

Coronavirus restrictions allow 'passive exercise'\n\nUpdated\n\nFishing is still allowed in New South Wales despite many outdoor activities being restricted amid the coronavirus lockdown after an intervention by a state minister.\n\nKey points: The NSW Police Minister intervened to have recreational boating be considered \"passive exercise\"\n\nThis is contrary to advice received by fisherman in Queensland\n\nNSW Police warned people could still be fined for not following physical distancing while fishing\n\n\n\nRecreational fishing was initially not considered by the NSW Government as a \"reasonable excuse\" or an \"essential activity\" and was slated to be banned alongside skate parks and bootcamps.\n\nHowever, the NSW Police Minister David Elliott said he personally intervened and obtained legal advice from the Police General Counsel which considered it \"passive exercise\".\n\nThe minister said he contacted Transport for NSW and had them strike out a section in an unpublished press release which banned recreational boating.\n\nNSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said, however, just because fishing was permitted it didn't mean it was an invitation for people to go boating en masse.\n\n\"If you do need a break and if [fishing] is your exercise, than do it sensibly and do it quickly and return home,\" he said.\n\n\"You can fish but if you end up on a wharf with 50 other people then we get back to safe distancing and getting tickets.\"\n\nThe exemption in NSW was distinctive from advice given to Queenslanders yesterday, which included recreational boating among its ban of outdoor activities.\n\nBut even without the personal intervention of a NSW minister, fishing would have still been acceptable in several circumstances outlined by the NSW Government.\n\nThe Public Health (COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement) Order 2020, which went into effect on March 31, would have allowed fishing if it was essential for work.\n\nCatching fish and then dropping it off to a market would have been legal under the exemption in the order which read \"travelling for the purposes of work or education if the person cannot do it at home\".\n\nReeling in a cod for dinner would also have been allowed under the provision which read \"obtaining food or other goods and services\".\n\nThese exemptions were later clarified by the Department of Primary Industries (DPI).\n\n\"Advice from NSW Police is that fishing is permitted, as long as people follow all other advice in relation to social distancing and gatherings of two or more people,\" the DPI said.\n\nTopics: covid-19, diseases-and-disorders, health, respiratory-diseases, health-policy, government-and-politics, infectious-diseases-other, maritime, nsw, australia, sydney-2000\n\nFirst posted"

Okeanis (OTCPK:OKENF), listed in Norway, has one of the youngest and most efficient fleets in the world and it's still trading at 0.55x NAV.\n\nMy estimate is that their profit for the first two quarters of this year is going to cover half of their market cap, so there is no reason why Okeanis should not trade at least at NAV, offering a potential upside of 80%.\n\nLet me first explain the sector's current situation and the investment opportunity and then take a closer look at the company, including a conservative valuation model.\n\nThe investment opportunity\n\nWhile the world is melting down, there is one industry that is generating obscene amounts of cash flow: crude tankers.\n\nCrude tankers are used to move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. It is an extremely cyclical industry: as there is not much difference between ships of the same size, rates depend only on supply/demand dynamics. As explained on the book \"Maritime Economics\" - Alan Branch (1997):\n\nIf there is too little supply, the market rewards investors with high freight rates until more ships are ordered. When there are too many ships it squeezes the cashflow until owners give up the struggle and ships are scrapped.\n\nShipowners are constantly playing the prisoner's dilemma, usually ordering more ships when rates peak and suffering the consequences when all this incremental supply is flooded into the market.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the main factors that are driving supply/demand dynamics at this precise moment:\n\nFleet and orderbook: the first point to consider is how many ships are on the water at this precise moment, and how many are going to be delivered in the next 2-3 years. Short-term prospects are good as it is shown in the figures below.\n\nSource: Frontline Q4 2019 Presentation\n\nOil War: Saudi Arabia initiated a price war with Russia, triggering a major fall in the price of oil, with US oil prices at 20$ at this moment.\n\nThere is a deep explanation about the implications of the oil war on the following article, written by J Mintzmyer, the Seeking Alpha's shipping expert. I strongly recommend taking a look at his articles to anyone interested in the shipping industry.\n\nBiggest Oil Price War Winner: Crude Tankers\n\nI also recommend watching the following video, where Trafigura's (the second largest independent oil trader) Luckock talks about oil glut and floating storage:\n\nOil Needs to Drop $10 to Match Demand, Trafigura's Luckock Says\n\nCOVID-19: Oil demand is impacted in three different ways: government shutdowns and travel restrictions, value-chain impacts from reduced economic activity, and less energy used by sick people. Goldman Sachs expects a global oil demand loss of 2.1 million b/d in the first half of the year alone. The views of IEA, EIA and OPEC are summarized below.\n\nSource: OET Earnings Presentation Q4 2019\n\nFrom my point of view, lockdowns are going to be worse than initially expected according to what we are experiencing in Europe, leading to unprecedented excess of oil.\n\nThese two factors have led to a steep contango in the oil futures curve. For those who need further explanation:\n\nContango is a situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price. This usually occurs when an asset price is expected to rise over time. This results in an upward sloping forward curve. Contango: What It Takes\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nThis steep contango incentivizes traders to buy crude, store it in a tanker and sell the future several months from now, booking millions in profits. There is an interesting explanation in this article.\n\nNow, let's say that the oldest few hundred VLCC tankers go into storage trades. That seriously crimps the global fleet supply of roughly 800 actively transporting crude. When 26 COSCO tankers were sanctioned last fall, rates went to 10-year highs. What happens when a few hundred leave the transport fleet? Well, rates go to Pluto. At current daily charter rates of around $200,000 to transport oil, a VLCC earns $70 million, which is a stunning return on a 10-year vessel worth about $50 million. Even better, the owner likely only has about $20 million of equity invested. This means that at current rates, the owner makes 3.5 times his money each year. Ironically, despite all of this going on, most tanker stocks trade at roughly half of NAV.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nIn conclusion, we see that there is going to be a great demand for oil tankers while supply is going to be reduced because of storage. Rates have already reacted to this situation and rallied 40% last week, reaching 200k$ for VLCC (Very Large Crude Carriers) according to Cleaves. This situation is impressive considering that we are in an unfavorable season for rates and operating expenses are around 20k$ for a ship like this.\n\nSource: Cleaves Securities Weekly Report 29 March 2020\n\nHere is an image of spot rates across the fleet (27 March).\n\nSource: @JHannisdahl Head of Research at Cleaves Securities\n\nThis rally in rates has led to a run up in the US listed tanker companies; however, we are going to focus on a Norway listed company that has lagged this run and is still trading near its 52-week lows: Okeanis Eco Tankers (\"OET\").\n\nSource: @JHannisdahl Head of Research at Cleaves Securities\n\nMoreover, we can see that the company is undervalued relative to peers in terms of Price/NAV.\n\nSource: Investor Update March 2020\n\nThis means that anyone could buy the entire company, sell all the ships (remember they are all brand new), pay down the debt, and still have a return of 30-40%.\n\nIn addition, the recent spike of the USD/NOK makes this investment even more compelling.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nIntroduction to the company\n\nOkeanis was founded on April 2018 in the Marshall Islands and listed on Oslo Axess under ticker OET-OAX (Prospectus). It has one of the youngest and most efficient fleets in the world, comprising eco vessels that comply with all IMO 2020 regulations.\n\nThere is a huge insider ownership, with the Alafouzos family controlling 57% of the shares. CEO, CFO and COO have 40, 14 and 12 years of experience relatively in the shipping industry.\n\nAs of March 2020, the Company's fleet consists of 17 vessels with an average age of 2 years and aggregate capacity of approximately 3.8 million deadweight tons:\n\n• 3 Aframax/LR2 vessels with an average age of 5 years.\n\n• 4 Suezmax vessels with an average age of 3 years.\n\n• 8 VLCC vessels with an average age of 1 year.\n\n• Two Suezmax newbuildings under construction at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries with expected delivery in September 2020.\n\nSource: Investor Update March 2020\n\nThe Company is audited by Deloitte.\n\nWhy is it that cheap?\n\nThe main reason that explains this poor relative behavior is that a fund managed by Ironsides Partners has been liquidating its position at a quick pace.\n\nSource: @JHannisdahl Head of Research at Cleaves Securities\n\nNevertheless, even if not in the same amount, insiders have been buying shares during the last three months.\n\nSource: Ortex OET\n\nThe other reason may be that the company has still not defined its intentions in terms of capital allocation (dividend, share buyback, growth...). However, I expect them to take the decision of initiating a dividend in the AGM that is going to take place the 15th of May.\n\nAccording to IPO prospectus, dividends received by Non-Norwegian Shareholders are not subject to Norwegian taxation unless the Non-Norwegian Shareholders hold the shares in connection with the conduct of a trade or business in Norway.\n\nValuation\n\nThese estimations are based on highly conservative assumptions. The Company estimates a FY2020 EBITDA of 217M$ with base rates VLCC-67k$, Suez 45.3K$ and Aframax 32.5k$, while my estimation is only 164M$.\n\nRates have been set to the Fearnley's estimates every quarter except on those where a different rate can be estimated (Tankers International, Guidance). Please note that true rates are much higher (nearly 2x rates used) at these moments.\n\nThere is no reason why utilization rates should not be near 100% in Q2, Q3 and Q4. Nevertheless, I have also been conservative setting 85% on average.\n\nTaxation: All companies comprising the Group are not subject to tax on international shipping income since their countries of incorporation do not impose such taxes. The Group's vessels are subject to registration and tonnage taxes, which are included under vessel operating expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\nSource: Author\n\nSo, even with a stressed model that underestimates fleet utilization and rates we get to an estimated P/E of 2. That means that the Company could generate half of its market cap in just one year.\n\nI firmly believe, and anyone can use the actual rates in the model to confirm, that the Company is going to generate half of its market cap at the end of Q2 2020.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nThis type of business operates with huge financial and operating leverage. That means that small revenue (rates) variations can have a great impact on profits. Needless to say that this works in both ways.\n\nFrom my point of view, even if an OPEC+ agreement could be reached and production trimmed, the impact of lockdowns on demand is going to be so severe that rates are going to stay high for at least two more quarters.\n\nThe Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk.\n\nThe high financial leverage makes this investment very risky, as failure to fulfill covenants or debt paydown requirements can easily lead to bankruptcy or dilution.\n\nIn addition, Okeanis' low number of ships make the company's revenues vulnerable in the event of a loss of revenue of any such vessels.\n\nThere is a risk also of conflict of interests due to the huge stake of the Alafouzos Family in the Company.\n\nFinally, one should not forget that the company has all the risks associated with microcaps.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long OKENF.
